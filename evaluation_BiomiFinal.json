His physical examination showed abdominal distention and tenderness. The vital signs were stable, and there was mild dehydration. All laboratory results were normal. Plain X-rays revealed a dilated bowel with air\u2013fluid levels. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study showed dilated bowels in the upper part of the abdomen, including the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum . Intravenous fluids were administered, and nasogastric tubes were placed. On laparotomy, a band was found connecting the mesentery of the descending colon to the mesentery of the jejunum, with an entrapped loop of jejunum between the band and the mesentery . The appearance of the intestines was normal with normal blood supply. This band was ligated and excised without bowel resection . Histological examination revealed fibrotic tissue with blood vessels and no malignant changes.",

The exact duration of these symptoms could not be precisely determined. Upon physical examination, the boy displayed signs of abdominal tenderness and distention. His vital signs remained stable, though there was evidence of slight dehydration. Laboratory results returned no abnormalities. A plain X-ray unveiled a dilated bowel with air-fluid levels. A subsequent upper gastrointestinal contrast study showed dilatation of the upper abdominal bowels, inclusive of the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. Intravenous fluids were given, and nasogastric tubes were implemented.\n\nA laparotomy procedure revealed a band connecting the mesentery of the descending colon and the mesentery of the jejunum, with a loop of jejunum entrapped between the band and the mesentery. The intestines appeared normal, with a healthy blood supply. The band was ligated and excised without necessitating bowel resection. A histological examination of the band showed fibrotic tissue with blood vessels and no signs of malignancy. The observations and surgical findings were consistent with a diagnosis of Congenital intestinal obstruction due to a mesenteric band.",

    "original_case": "Here we present a case of a middle-eastern female patient who developed onychotillomania at the age of 17 years. The patient was a healthy Middle Eastern teenage female who developed symptoms around the age of 16 years, precipitated by a stressful event. The patient experienced recurrent, intrusive, distressing, and time-consuming obsessional thoughts of being surveilled through her phone. These obsessions also made her functionally impaired. Consequently, the patient started to avoid using the phone and eventually damaged it. Nevertheless, her symptoms persisted even with a new phone. Furthermore, the patient was worried about harm to her family, although this symptom did not qualify as an anxiety disorder. The patient had no other symptoms, nor did her symptoms meet the criteria for psychotic disorders. She was under the care of another physician at the time of onset of the condition, and was treated with fluoxetine, which was changed to paroxetine with clear justification. The patient commenced paroxetine 20 mg titrated to 30 mg daily and started showing improvements. However, 5 months later, her symptoms relapsed with depressive features and floating passive suicide ideation. Additionally, she demonstrated nail picking that was mainly directed towards the big toes and the skin around the nails using only her fingers. On examination, the lateral nail fold was erythematous and swollen with bleeding in both big toes, which may indicate a distolateral ingrowth and the nails showed scales and signs of distal nail tearing by the patient. Sometimes the patient\u2019s injuries required bandaging (Figs. 1 and 2). These symptoms were distressing, occurred daily, and were preceded by an urge and followed by a relief. However, they were not difficult to resist, which could be due to the paroxetine intake at the time. This complaint was not related to anxiety or depressive symptoms, and the patient had no other body-focused repetitive behaviors. Subsequently, the dose of paroxetine was increased to 40 mg. Two months later, the patient started to experience side effects that included weight gain and difficulty in urination. Medication was switched to fluoxetine at a dose of 20 mg titrated, which was later increased to 40 mg daily. After the resolution of symptoms, upon the patient\u2019s request, 6\u20137 months later, the medication was reduced. The fluoxetine dose was tapered and discontinued over 3 months without any relapse in symptoms. However, 2\u20133 months later, the symptoms relapsed and treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg was recommenced. At the time of writing this report, approximately 2 months after restarting fluoxetine, the patient\u2019s condition had partially improved and the nail-picking behavior remained remitted.",
    "rewritten_case": "In this narrative, we discuss the case of a female patient of Middle Eastern descent who, at some point during her late teenage years, began to exhibit signs of onychotillomania. Initially, the patient was a healthy individual who reported the onset of symptoms following a significant stressful event. The patient started experiencing persistent, intrusive, disturbing, and time-consuming obsessional thoughts that she was being watched through her phone, leading to a notable impairment in her daily functioning. As a result, she developed an aversion to using her phone and went to the extent of destroying it. However, acquiring a new phone did not alleviate her symptoms. \n\nMoreover, the patient expressed concerns about the safety of her family, a symptom that did not align with the criteria for an anxiety disorder. She showed no other symptoms, and her condition did not meet the diagnostic criteria for psychotic disorders. During the onset of her symptoms, she was under the care of a physician who prescribed fluoxetine, which was later switched to paroxetine for reasons that were well justified. The patient began with a 20 mg dose of paroxetine, which was gradually increased to 30 mg daily, and she started showing signs of improvement.\n\nHowever, after an unspecified duration, her symptoms returned, but this time they were accompanied by depressive features and passive suicidal thoughts. Furthermore, she began to engage in nail-picking behavior, focusing primarily on her big toes and the surrounding skin using only her fingers. Upon examination, her lateral nail fold was found to be red and swollen, with signs of bleeding in both big toes. This could potentially indicate a distolateral ingrowth, and the nails showed scales and signs of distal nail tearing by the patient. Occasionally, the patient\u2019s self-inflicted injuries required bandaging. These symptoms were distressing, occurred daily, and were usually preceded by an urge and followed by a sense of relief. However, the patient did not find them excessively difficult to resist, which could be attributed to her paroxetine intake at the time. \n\nDespite the severity of the symptoms, they were not associated with her anxiety or depressive symptoms, and the patient did not display any other body-focused repetitive behaviors. Thereafter, her paroxetine dosage was increased to 40 mg, and after a period, she began to experience side effects such as weight gain and difficulty urinating. As a result, her medication was switched back to fluoxetine, starting with a 20 mg dose that was later increased to 40 mg daily. \n\nEventually, the patient's symptoms resolved, and at her request, her medication was gradually reduced over a period. After some time off medication without any relapse of symptoms, the patient experienced a return of her previous symptoms, leading to the reintroduction of fluoxetine at a 20 mg dose. At the time of documenting this case, the patient\u2019s condition had shown some improvement after an unspecified duration on fluoxetine, and her nail-picking behavior was in remission.",

For the last 2 years, pain at the right wrist joint level and fourth finger flexion failure had also occurred. All the symptoms were induced by wrist and fourth finger flexion and extension. Recently, the patient had noted weakening of the right wrist. Examination did not reveal any visible or palpable pathology at the wrist level. Weakening of the right wrist was noted while the patient was grabbing the examiners\u2019 hand. Neurological examination revealed reduced sensitivity (pain) via the median nerve area at the right wrist. Triggering at the right wrist was noted during flexion and extension of the radiocarpal joint. Despite the obvious presence of carpal tunnel syndrome, Tinel\u2019s sign was not present. MRI of the right wrist was performed: no pathological masses were seen inside the carpal tunnel. The compression of the right median nerve was confirmed by electroneuromyography. Carpal tunnel release was performed. The tumor was attached to the flexor superficialis tendon sheath and was moving through the carpal tunnel via fourth finger and wrist flexion and extension. The tumor was excised, and the wound was closed . A morphological study was performed . Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for differential diagnosis with peripheral nerve tumors . The tumor was composed of cells with a myoid phenotype . The postoperative protocol included positioning the hand in a resting splint, regular wound dressings, and antibiotics for 3 days. All fingers were left free for regular active finger exercises. The patient was discharged after 3 days of the postoperative period. Sutures were removed after 2 weeks after surgery.

The patient also reported a general weakening of the right wrist, the timeline of which was uncertain.\n\nUpon examination, there were no visible or palpable abnormalities at the wrist level. However, notable weakening was observed when the patient attempted to grip the examiners' hand.

She had no history of illness, and biochemical parameters and tumor markers were within normal limits. Helicobacter pylori antibodies were negative, and EGD showed atrophic changes associated with previous H. pylori infection. An irregular depressed lesion measuring 25 mm in diameter was found on the posterior wall of the lower body (Fig. 1 a, b). Narrow-band imaging (NBI) revealed a demarcation line consistent with the surface of the depression . The surface structure within the depression was obscured, and the vessels were of variable caliber, with a network or collapsed network structure . Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with a well-differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma [tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1\u20132)], and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed .

Histologically, the tumor was composed of two components [tub2 adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (NEC)], and it showed submucosal and lymphatic invasion. As shown in Fig. 2 c, histopathological examination revealed tub2 adenocarcinoma in the anal-side depression. In the oral-side depression, tumor cells lacked glandular structures and had nested trabecular or acinar-like structures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for synaptophysin and CD56, and chromogranin partially, confirming the diagnosis of NEC.

However, follow-up imaging suggested occlusion in the bypass area. Given the history of recurrent oral aphthous lesions and extensive body folliculitis lesions, a specific condition was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 test, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 79, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 5.2 (normal: 0.5), as well as pathological findings from the open right subclavian artery bypass surgery. Cyclophosphamide therapy was the treatment of choice for the patient, but due to infertility concerns, he refused. Therefore, he was treated with azathioprine 100 mg daily, prednisolone 30 mg daily, colchicine 1 mg daily, and rivaroxaban 20 mg daily postoperatively. The patient\u2019s compliance was good, and according to the latest rheumatological reports prior to his admission to our facility, his condition was under control and no hypercoagulable symptoms were observed. After admitting the patient, with all his past history in mind, we requested a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) with suspicion of a vascular pathology causing pressure effect on the recurrent laryngeal nerves. CTA revealed a 32 \u00d7 27 mm ruptured pseudoaneurysm originating from innominate artery bifurcation with a 90 \u00d7 61 \u00d7 65 mm hematoma extending to the right shoulder and forming an extrapleural hematoma at the apex of the right thoracic cavity . The trachea was deviated to the left side due to the mass effect of the pseudoaneurysm. Despite total occlusion of the right subclavian and axillary arteries by thrombosis, the patient had no complaint regarding his right upper extremity, which shows that there was probably sufficient collateral blood perfusion. Even though we retrospectively reexamined his previous CTA from the former admission, no anomaly was found in the innominate artery. We decided to repair the ruptured pseudoaneurysm by an endovascular approach. Preoperatively, the patient received methylprednisolone to decrease postoperative complications. In a hybrid operation room, we performed a digital subtraction angiography. Unfortunately, owing to the lack of proper landing zone, we could not perform an endovascular repair by stent graft. Inevitably, we approached the pseudoaneurysm by a median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension. After excising the ruptured pseudoaneurysm and evacuating the surrounding hematoma, we performed an innominate artery to the right common carotid artery bypass with a 6 mm expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft, which passed right behind the innominate vein . The pressure effect of the pseudoaneurysm was removed from the right recurrent laryngeal, phrenic, and vagus nerves with no neural damage. We decided not to perform a right subclavian artery bypass since it was previously thrombosed, and the patient had no complaint concerning the right upper extremity.",
    "rewritten_case": "A 28-year-old Iranian male patient presented with complaints of right shoulder discomfort and voice hoarseness that had persisted for a week before he was admitted. The patient's medical history revealed an open right subclavian artery bypass operation approximately 1.5 years earlier due to acute ischemia in the right upper extremity, which was triggered by thrombosis in the aneurysmal right subclavian artery spreading to the distal arterial branches. Subsequent imaging showed an occlusion in the bypassed area. \n\nGiven the patient's history of recurrent oral aphthous and extensive body folliculitis lesions, a specific condition was suspected. Diagnostic tests revealed a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 test, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 79, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5.2 (normal: 0.5). Despite these findings, the patient's clinical picture alongside the presence of a severe headache and blurred vision raised the suspicion of a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n\nOn admission, considering the patient's medical history, we ordered a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) suspecting a vascular anomaly that could be exerting pressure on the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The CTA revealed a 32 \u00d7 27 mm ruptured pseudoaneurysm originating from the innominate artery bifurcation and a 90 \u00d7 61 \u00d7 65 mm hematoma extending to the right shoulder, forming an extrapleural hematoma at the apex of the right thoracic cavity. The trachea was deviated to the left due to the mass effect of the pseudoaneurysm. \n\nDespite the total occlusion of the right subclavian and axillary arteries by thrombosis, the patient did not report any discomfort in his right upper limb, suggesting sufficient collateral blood flow. Retrospective examination of his previous CTA from the earlier admission did not reveal any abnormalities in the innominate artery. \n\nInterestingly, the patient's neurological symptoms along with the presence of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained through lumbar puncture, steered the diagnosis towards a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the presence of a pseudoaneurysm and the patient's history of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome suggested a more complex clinical scenario. \n\nThe patient was taken to a hybrid operation room for a digital subtraction angiography. Unfortunately, due to an inadequate landing zone, an endovascular repair by stent graft was not feasible. Consequently, a median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension was performed to access the pseudoaneurysm. After the ruptured pseudoaneurysm was excised and the surrounding hematoma evacuated, a bypass was performed from the innominate artery to the right common carotid artery using a 6 mm expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft. The pseudoaneurysm's pressure was relieved from the right recurrent laryngeal, phrenic, and vagus nerves without any neural damage. The right subclavian artery bypass was not performed as it was previously thrombosed and the patient reported no discomfort in the right upper extremity. \n\nDespite the initial misleading findings pointing towards a subarachnoid hemorrhage, the final diagnosis was Beh\u00e7et's syndrome with a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the innominate artery.",

Few minutes after receiving gadolinium during MRI, she presented to the ED with shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Upon admission, she had a brief period of loss of consciousness and her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 84/40 mmHg; temperature, 36.4 \u00b0C; heart rate (HR), 122 beats per minute; respiratory rate (RR), 30 breaths per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 78%. Her pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral rales, but she did not have rash, or tongue or lip swelling. Despite significant hypoxemia, she was able to speak in whole sentences, and inhaled oxygen was delivered through a non-rebreather mask (NRBM) at 10 L per minute. She immediately received 500 mg of hydrocortisone and a 1 L bolus of intravenous crystalloids, but epinephrine was not administered upon the patient\u2019s presentation.

    "rewritten_case": "The patient was an 8-year-old, previously healthy, and fully immunized Iranian girl who was initially brought to the pediatric emergency department after experiencing 5 days of intermittent fever, followed by abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was a home-based child, having not attended school for the past 6 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was cared for by her parents. Her parents had exhibited signs and symptoms consistent with a mild upper respiratory tract infection a week prior.\n\nDespite being an active child, she spent most of her time at home due to the pandemic situation. Recently, she had received outpatient care in the form of oral antibiotics and intravenous serum. Upon presenting to Akbar Hospital with fever and abdominal pain, she was initially suspected to have appendicitis. However, her symptoms persisted, including nausea, vomiting, and the emergence of a rash and conjunctivitis, despite normal sonography findings.\n\nThe patient was subsequently referred to the pediatric COVID-19 ward, despite not exhibiting common symptoms such as cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. On the third day of her stay, she was given co-trimoxazole and ondansetron. Physical examination revealed bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, an erythematous throat, palmar erythema, a strawberry tongue, and an erythema multiform rash, but no hypotension. No lymphadenopathy or retraction breathing was observed, and her respiratory sounds were normal. There were no focal signs of infection.\n\nOn cardiac examination, an II/VI murmur was detected on the left sternal border. Due to her ongoing fever (38.6 \u00b0C) and the current COVID-19 pandemic, she underwent a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs, which did not indicate a COVID-19 infection. Laboratory evaluation included urinalysis and urine culture, both of which were negative. However, her ESR was 67 mm/h, CRP 166 mg/L, platelets count at 192 \u00d7 10^9/L, hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL, and WBC 10.3\u00d710^9/L (PMN: 82%). Routine biochemistry and liver function tests were within normal limits.\n\nInterestingly, her blood culture showed the presence of Brucella organisms, a common cause of brucellosis, a disease known for its nonspecific symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, and nausea. The child received IVIG (2 g/kg; 1 g/kg on two consecutive days) and high-dose acetylsalicylic acid (20 mg/kg four times daily) as per rheumatology consultation. Echocardiography did not show any pathology related to coronary arteries.\n\nFurther evaluation for respiratory tract viral infections via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for COVID-19, along with blood culture, all yielded negative results. The patient had no recent history of travel. However, her parents had been experiencing flu-like symptoms, including hypogeusia and anosmia.\n\nShe was hospitalized for 5 days.

Consequently, the public health department was notified, and the family was instructed to quarantine at home for 14 days from the positive test result date. With the presence of Brucella organisms in her blood and the nonspecific symptoms, a diagnosis of brucellosis was considered.",

He was up-to-date with all his immunizations, including vaccination for S. pneumoniae; he had received PCV7 as the initial series and a booster of PCV13. He was receiving mycophenolate mofetil 200 mg twice a day for about 6 months and prednisone 30 mg on alternate days for about 1 month. The child\u2019s only complaint was neck pain and stiffness that had begun 1\u20132 days prior to presentation. His mother attributed the neck pain to muscle tightness and stated that massages to the area provided some pain relief. There was no history of recent illness, fever, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, headache, seizures, or altered mental status. On physical examination, he was afebrile and had mild periorbital swelling and edema on lower extremities. He appeared ill, exhibited neck rigidity, and revealed reflex knee flexion on neck flexion.

He was treated with immunomodulators including an initial treatment of azathioprine 50 mg and prednisolone 15 mg twice daily, and mesalazine. Owing to remission of the clinical symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease, prednisolone was gradually tapered off; prednisone use covered a total period of 3 months. Following 4 months of azathioprine and 3 months of prednisolone use, the patient complained of persistent abdominal pain and diarrhea.

He had been hospitalized for 1 month at a public hospital in Natal, Brazil, with initial symptoms of intense diarrhea, daily fevers, sweating, and chills for 3 weeks. He was diagnosed with disseminated TB, and tuberculostatic treatment (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide) was given for 10 days. However, due to increased transaminase levels, his regimen was changed to levofloxacin, capreomycin, and ethambutol. He was observed for 10 days and discharged.

The patient also had dyspnea in the supine position, night sweats, and mild appetite loss for 1 month, but no complaints of any gastrointestinal symptoms. She was diagnosed with UC at the age of 29 years with bloody diarrhea, had been in long-term remission for over 35 years, and was taking salazosulfapyridine (1000\u20131500 mg/day) orally. She had no history of occupational dust exposure, but had a family history of pulmonary tuberculosis. On physical examination, her vital signs were as follows: temperature, 36.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 99 beats per minute; blood pressure, 136/74 mmHg; respiratory rate, 16 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation on room air, 98%. Auscultation of the neck and chest revealed normal breath sounds, without adventitious sounds. The rest of the physical examination, including the outer ear, nose, and joints, was normal. Blood analysis revealed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 10.71 mg/dL) and increased levels of leucine-rich \u03b1-2-glycoprotein (LRG; 44.2 \u03bcg/mL, normal < 16.0 \u03bcg/mL), a new biomarker for evaluating disease activity in patients with UC. Tumor markers, proteinase-3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were within normal limits, and T-SPOT.TB (an interferon-\u03b3 release assay) was negative. Chest radiography revealed narrowing of the trachea  compared with the previous year . Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated circumferential thickening of the tracheal wall, ranging from the trachea to the bilateral main bronchi , without lung parenchymal abnormalities.

She had been put on abacavir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir 3 weeks before, as a routine switch from a TDF-based regimen. She had previously been on a regimen of TDF, 3TC, and efavirenz but had it changed because of the availability of a new formulation of ABC, 3TC, and DTG (Triumeq) that was deemed better by her primary physician. She reported a dry cough, sore throat, chest discomfort, and myalgia. She also reported a history of vomiting 3 days before the hospital visit. She was subject to fever and chills, was anorexic and nauseous. She also complained of occasional headaches, without neck stiffness or photophobia. She had been tested for malaria a couple of times a few days prior, but was persistently negative. At presentation, her blood pressure was 142/84 mmHg, heart rate 102 beats per minute, with temperature 36.1 \u00b0C and oxygen saturation at 94% on ambient air. On examination, she had an inflamed throat and posterior palate with tender tonsils to palpation, her chest was clear and the cardiovascular system examination was otherwise unremarkable. She also had tenderness to palpation of the limb muscles without evidence of arthritis. Remarkably, she had a white cell count of 2.6 \u00d7 10^9/L (73% granulocytes, 22% lymphocytes), hemoglobin of 14.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 122 \u00d7 10^9/L, but her kidney function tests were within normal. The rest of the laboratory results are outlined in Additional file 1: Table S1. She was admitted for intravenous rehydration and bed rest, with a presumption of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, the sore throat persisted despite the initial relief. On the second day of admission, she complained of generalized body ache. Laboratory results showed a significant increase in liver enzymes, thus prompting testing for viral hepatitis and repeat testing for malaria, which turned positive, and she was subsequently started on artesunate. The patient was advised to suspend her ART given the liver impairments. She responded well to treatment and the transaminases started to improve, although she kept complaining of myalgias and progressive body swelling with paresthesia in the lower limbs. She was discharged on the seventh day feeling better. She was, however, readmitted a day after discharge (ninth day since the first admission) complaining of an episode of severe headache followed by profuse sweating. She denied fever but reported that she had vomited six times that day and had three episodes of diarrhea with burning lower abdominal pains. Her blood pressure was 87/50 mmHg, heart rate 130 beats per minute, temperature 35.4 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 88%. Apart from a tender epigastrium, systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable. She was started on rabeprazole, antibiotics to cover hospital acquired infection, and ondansetron. Unfortunately, cultures were not taken. She was also started on Ringer\u2019s lactate. Significantly, her laboratory results showed features of acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 183 \u00b5mol/L. On the second day of this admission, she developed a rash in the extremities that spread to the trunk, she was started on cetirizine and mometasone cream. As her blood pressure improved, the kidney function improved. In addition, there was a notable improvement in the liver transaminases compared with previous tests. The rash also improved. She was discharged after 5 days (13 days after the initial admission). However, the patient was readmitted the night of the day of discharge, in a hysterical state with burning chest pain and chills. Her blood pressure was 108/67 mmHg, heart rate 153 beats per minute, temperature 34.2 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Systemic examination was unremarkable. There was no notable rash at this time. A bedside electrocardiogram was unremarkable apart from the extreme tachycardia and an arterial blood gas report consistent with respiratory alkalosis with lactate of 4.3 mmol/L. However, there was a highly elevated serum level of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium. On further interrogation, the patient revealed that she had taken the ABC-containing tablets shortly before she became unwell and she had vomited a while after that. It was also noted that the patient had been restarting her ART every time she was discharged, contrary to advice. The patient was managed supportively and showed marked improvement, although she still had peripheral neuropathy of the left lower limb requiring physiotherapy and the use of a crutch. On clinical suspicion, an HLA-B*57:01 test was requested. This proved positive and the patient was advised to completely stop the ABC/DTG/3TC regimen. She was discharged after a 2-day stay at the hospital. On follow-up, she did well. She presented 12 days later (27 days after the initial presentation) with severe headaches and episodes of confusion. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a left posterior parietal tuberculoma. She was started on rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, and then rifampicin and isoniazid for 16 months (this was occasioned by persistent symptoms at 12 months and persistent but shrinking tuberculoma). She received a short course of dexamethasone at the beginning of this treatment. Two months after the initial presentation, her ART regimen was changed to a two-tablet regime consisting of DTG and a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine plus TDF. This was occasioned by a rise in the HIV viral load with stable liver and kidney function test results while on antituberculous therapy. She made tremendous improvement overall, although she has persistent headaches 24 months after the first episode. The most recent CD4 count is 512 cells/\u00b5L and viral load is 22 copies/mL. The timeline of events is summarized in Fig. 1.",

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Chinese man who suffered from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm underwent craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation. No problems with swallowing or speaking were reported during the surgery. Unfortunately, the patient experienced dysarthria, dysphagia, and trouble with tongue movement after the surgery. Thus, we performed a detailed neurological examination. In addition to the symptoms described above, we also found symptoms linked to cranial nerve injuries, such as a weakened pharyngeal reflex, tongue deviation toward the affected side, atrophy of tongue muscle, and so on. Further evaluations and imaging examinations were carried out. The rating of the functional oral intake scale (FOIS) was level 2. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) showed that the contrast agent leaked into the vestibule of the larynx and entered the trachea through the glottis when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid . The rating of Rosenbek leakage/aspiration scale was level 8, which is the worst level. When the patient drank 3 ml of medium-thick semi-fluid liquid, effective swallowing was not initiated and the epiglottis valley had a large amount of residue. When examined through the electronic laryngoscope, we noticed paralysis of bilateral vocal folds . All these observations indicated that the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve had been injured. Therefore, we thought that there may be a lesion in or near the brainstem that led to nerve injury. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that there were no brainstem lesions , and that the symptoms that arose after surgery could not be explained by the left frontal lobe malacia and subdural hematoma . Owing to the inconformity of symptoms and radiographic results, we decided to analyze the rare case again. When we reviewed the clinical history, we noticed that the surgery was performed under general anesthesia and transoral intubation, so there may be a connection between transoral intubation and nerve injury. After consulting with the ear\u2013nose\u2013throat (ENT) and anesthesiology departments, we excluded arytenoid dislocation and violent intubation. Then we found that these symptoms are similar to those of a specific syndrome, so we compared the characteristics of this case with diagnostic criteria of that syndrome. First, in terms of clinical history, the majority of cases occur following the surgical intervention under general anesthesia and transoral intubation. Our patient went through craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation before these symptoms arose. Second, symptoms of the patient included difficulties in tongue movement, unilateral tongue paralysis, and atrophy of the tongue, as well as hoarseness and dysphagia, which matches the described symptoms of that syndrome. Third, the complete neurological examination showed that there are cranial nerve injuries and, based on the MRI results, we excluded lesions in the brainstem. Hence the symptoms are likely caused by peripheral nerve injuries. Thus, a diagnosis was made. Fig. 1 Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS).

So we decided to include electroacupuncture as a measure in our treatment to observe the effect. The patient received acupuncture treatment 30 minutes per day, six times per week for 52 days . Qi She brand disposable, sterile steel needles (0.25\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm; Wuxi Jiajian Medical Instrument Co. Ltd) were used. Based on our experience in treating similar diseases, we chose several acupoints to improve deglutition and speech function. These acupoints included the three-needle tongue (Shanglianquan, located in the depression between the lingual bone and the border of the lower jaw, 1 cun inferior to the midline of the jaw), and two other acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (note that the width of the interphalangeal joint of the patient\u2019s thumb is taken as 1 cun, approximately 25 mm), Dicang (ST 4, with the eyes looking straight forward, the point is vertically below the pupil, at the level of the angle of the mouth), Taixi (KI 3, in the depression between the tip of the medial malleolus and Achilles\u2019 tendon), and Zhaohai (KI 6, in the depression below the tip of the medial malleolus). Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation (EA parameters were set as follows: discontinuous wave with frequency 5 Hz, pulse width 1 ms, and intensity approximately 2 mA, until a slight jitter in the muscle is observed) was applied to two acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (EX). No side effects such as bleeding or hematoma were observed during the entire treatment. Fig. 4 The location of acupoints. Acupoints on face and neck (three-needle tongue and Dicang).

These acupoints included the three-needle tongue (Shanglianquan, located in the depression between the lingual bone and the border of the lower jaw, 1 cun inferior to the midline of the jaw), and two other acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (note that the width of the interphalangeal joint of the patient\u2019s thumb is taken as 1 cun, approximately 25 mm), Dicang (ST 4, with the eyes looking straight forward, the point is vertically below the pupil, at the level of the angle of the mouth), Taixi (KI 3, in the depression between the tip of the medial malleolus and Achilles\u2019 tendon), and Zhaohai (KI 6, in the depression below the tip of the medial malleolus). Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation (EA parameters were set as follows: discontinuous wave with frequency 5 Hz, pulse width 1 ms, and intensity approximately 2 mA, until a slight jitter in the muscle is observed) was applied to two acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (EX). No side effects such as bleeding or hematoma were observed during the entire treatment. Fig. 4 The location of acupoints. Acupoints on face and neck (three-needle tongue and Dicang).

    "original_case": "A 68-year-old Japanese man was found to have an extensive type 0\u2013IIc lesion in the upper gastric body extending up to the hypogastric lesser curvature on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in September 2019. Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; the patient was referred to our department for surgery. He had hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, he had no family history of malignancy. The patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, D1+\u2009lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction in November 2019. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged 6\u00a0days postoperatively. The initial surgical specimen findings were as follows : a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200935-mm 0\u2013IIc lesion with shallow depression ranging from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature. Histopathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins that were staged IA (pT1aN0M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors, 8th edition. Fig. 1 First surgical specimen. The arrows show the tumor.\u00a0Lesion with shallow depression extending from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature Full size image The patient was followed-up without adjuvant chemotherapy; however, a 38\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u00a0mm soft tissue mass was noted on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach during computed tomography (CT) 2\u00a0years after the procedure. Although partial thickening of the gastric wall was seen retrospectively in a 1-year postoperative CT scan, it was reviewed within normal limits by a radiologist at that time . No evidence of recurrent metastasis was found at other sites. Fig. 2 One\u00a0year postoperatively (a), 2\u00a0years postoperatively (b). The soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach is enlarged.\u00a0The arrows show the soft tissue mass Full size image The blood test findings were as follows: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 1.8\u00a0ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), 8.5 U/mL; and soluble IL-2 receptor, 396 U/mL. Colonoscopy had been performed prior to the first surgery; hence, it was not performed again. The FDG-PET/CT findings were as follows : The soft tissue mass on the left side of the residual stomach showed moderate FDG accumulation (SUVmax, 5.25). No FDG accumulation was observed in other areas. Malignant lesions, including recurrent gastric cancer and regional lymph node metastasis, were suspected; however, qualitative diagnosis was difficult. No abnormal accumulation indicating recurrence and metastasis occurred at other sites. Fig. 3 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography. The soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach shows FDG accumulation (SUVmax 5.25). The arrows show the soft tissue mass. FDG fluorodeoxyglucose Full size image Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed the following findings : the soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach exhibited a high, heterogenous signal on T2-weighted images and a low signal on T1-weighted images, and contrast imaging revealed a slow contrast effect. Other malignant lesions such as gastric cancer recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) were considered as possible differential diagnoses; however, none of the findings were typical, and qualitative diagnosis was difficult. Fig. 4 Magnetic resonance imaging. T2-weighted image showing a heterogeneous high signal.\u00a0The arrows show the soft tissue mass Full size image Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings were as follows : no mass lesions were present in the remnant stomach. Transgastric ultrasonography revealed a 43\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u00a0mm borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum, which was biopsied using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Fig. 5 Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. A borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum Full size image The biopsy results were as follows: the tumor contained multiple spindle-shaped cells, and immunostaining for CD34, c-kit, desmin, S-100, and \u03b2-catenin was performed to distinguish spindle-shaped tumors; however, no significant positive findings were obtained. The biopsy specimen did not allow us to estimate the histological type of the tumor as it did not conclusively suggest a GIST, smooth myxoid, or schwannoma. Based on the above-mentioned examination results, local recurrence of gastric cancer, lymph node metastasis, a GIST, a smooth myxoid, and a schwannoma were regarded as possible differential diagnoses. Although the possibility of a benign tumor remained, a definitive diagnosis could not be made histopathologically, and moderate FDG accumulation could not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, we decided to operate for diagnostic treatment. Preoperative CT revealed a suspicious finding of splenic arteriovenous invasion; therefore, total residual gastrectomy and splenectomy were planned. The surgical findings were as follows: the abdomen was opened via a median upper abdominal incision. A 50\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u00a0mm soft tissue mass originating from the gastrojejunal anastomosis involving the spleen and splenic arteriovenous was observed on the greater curvature side of the anastomosis. Additionally, a partial invasion of the pancreas was observed. The remaining stomach, spleen, splenic artery and vein, and part of the pancreas, including the gastrojejunal anastomosis, along with the soft tissue mass, were removed as a single lump. Regarding reconstruction, only esophago-jejunal anastomosis was performed, sparing previous jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. The operation time was 279\u00a0minutes, and blood loss was 1100\u00a0mL; however, no blood transfusion was required. Pathological findings of the resected specimen were as follows : a 45\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200940-mm soft tissue mass extending from the muscularis propria to the serosa at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The tumor was a white, substantial nodule, and its growth involved the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Although fibroblasts and spindle-shaped cells were observed inside the tumor, the Ki-67 index was about 2%, and atypia was not observed. Immunostaining was positive for vimentin, desmin, and \u03b2-catenin and negative for \u03b1-SMA, S-100, CD34, c-kit, STAT6, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PgR). Based on the above, a diagnosis was made. Fig. 6 Pathological findings.  The arrows show the tumor.\u00a0Tumor growth involving anastomosis is observed (a).

    "original_case": "A 29-year-old white male was transported to the emergency department by ambulance after experiencing a seizure in the early morning hours in September 2018. He had experienced mild pain in his left leg 1 day earlier, but did not experience any shortness of breath or chest pain at this time. Past medical history included minor mitral valve prolapse diagnosed in adolescence and at age 18 years a left tibial tubercle fracture. The patient was a commercial airline pilot and reported an average of 18 days or 90 hour per month spent piloting. He was living in a high-altitude city at the time of symptom presentation. Family history included a cousin with epilepsy and was otherwise non-contributory. The patient was discharged after an unremarkable head computed tomography (CT) scan and was referred to neurology. Neurology ruled out epilepsy as the cause of his seizures. Additional work-up, including electroencephalogram (EEG), was within normal limits. One week after his first seizure and subsequent neurology consult, the patient presented at urgent care with left leg pain and exertional shortness of breath. No imaging or bloodwork was ordered at this time. He was discharged with an erroneous diagnosis of allergies. Later in the same month, he experienced his second seizure, again in the early morning hours, but did not seek emergent medical care. Upon a second evaluation by the neurologist, he was prescribed levetiracetam. In November 2018, the patient presented to the emergency department with 3-day history of shortness of breath, hemoptysis, left calf pain radiating to the popliteal area, and intermittent left midsternal chest pain. The patient underwent an extended period of automobile travel of approximately 20 hour duration 2 weeks prior. The patient\u2019s vitals were BP 145/88, MAP 107 mmHg, temperature 97.8 \u00b0F, HR 93, RR 16, and SaO2 of 95% on RA. Upon physical examination, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no diminished breath sounds. Cardiac auscultation revealed no gallops or murmurs. Radial and femoral pulses were normal bilaterally. No edema was found in the extremities. The neurological examination was within normal limits. Blood work and imaging were subsequently ordered. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm and a rate of 98 bpm. D-dimer was elevated, which prompted further testing. Chest CT chest with intravenous (IV) contrast showed extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism . Clot burden was identified in left and right interlobar arteries extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches without infarction or effusion. IV tPA was administered. A 4-mm lingular nodule was found on CT, and oncological work-up was recommended. Fig. 1 (Left) an axial slice from a CT of the chest obtained during the pulmonary angiographic phase of IV contrast administration demonstrates the largest site of PE in the patient, located in the left proximal interlobar pulmonary artery. (Right) a coronal view demonstrating PE located in the left proximal interlobar pulmonary artery Full size image At this time, the differential diagnosis was still broad. Trousseau\u2019s syndrome was on the differential but was ruled out. Oncologic work-up was negative for malignancy. Laboratory values were within normal limits. The patient had not experienced another seizure. Work-up included full-body CT scan, which revealed findings . Hematological profile was also within normal limits, and the findings were postulated to be the cause of the patient\u2019s clotting and was added to the differential for the underlying cause of his symptom profile. Treatment options were discussed including long-term anticoagulation therapy as a minimally invasive option and venoplasty as an invasive option. The patient wished to proceed with the more definitive option and elected to undergo endovascular venoplasty with stent placement. In March 2019, Interventional Radiology placed bilateral common iliac and right external iliac venous stents to attempt definitive treatment. Stents were placed bilaterally after Doppler flow analysis showed diminished blood flow in both left and right internal iliac veins. Post-catheterization CT with three-dimensional (3D) rendering showed placement position of and patent luminary blood flow through the stents (Figs. 3, 4). Fig. 2 CT scans in all planes with 3D rendering demonstrate severe compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. 3D rendering demonstrates associated changes of the vein underlying the artery Full size image Fig. 3 Intraoperative venograms show ballooning (left), stent deployment (middle), and completion of deployment (right).

It was deemed safe to discontinue heparin and switch to daily aspirin 4 weeks after venoplasty. Six days after discontinuation of heparin, the patient experienced another thrombotic event presenting with left leg pain and shortness of breath. Diagnostic workup, including CT, was significant for PE, and the patient was taken to the interventional radiology suite. The right popliteal vein was accessed in an integrated fashion using a six French vascular sheath. A venogram was performed. A guidewire and catheter were advanced into the common femoral veins bilaterally, and simultaneous iliac venograms were performed. Catheters were then advanced bilaterally into the common iliac stents, and IV contrast was injected. Significant thrombus was demonstrated within the right proximal external iliac vein and bilateral stented common iliac veins. The thrombus also extended proximally into the inferior vena cava (IVC) immediately above the stents as well as distally into the left femoral and popliteal veins . Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy was then performed through each access site, from the left popliteal vein through the left iliac veins and into the IVC, and also from the right external iliac vein into the IVC. Fig. 5 Venography 5 weeks post-stent placement shows stents in place complicated by severe intrastent and intravenous thrombosis extending into the inferior vena cava Full size image Following thrombectomy, 20 cm infusion length catheters were deployed bilaterally. tPA infusion was initiated through each infusion catheter. In addition, to treat the nonocclusive thrombus within the distal left femoral and popliteal veins, tPA was also infused through the access sheath at that site. All sheaths and catheters were secured to the skin, and weight-based heparin was continued. Twenty-four hours later, the patient underwent fluoroscopy which confirmed patency of the treated segments . The patient remained inpatient for monitoring for the next 24 h and was discharged home on apixaban for chemoprophylaxis. The patient tolerated the procedure without complication. Fig. 6 Venography shows patent flow 24 hours after inpatient pharmacomechanical thrombectomy Full size image The patient has since reported no additional seizures, clotting events, or emergency department visits. No other significant disorders have been found, including testing for Factor V Leiden, cancer, thyroid disorders, and patent foramen ovale. Despite the negative hematological testing, the patient remains on lifelong Coumadin in the event of an undiscovered hypercoagulopathy. The care team theorizes that the seizures resulted from hypoxia due to induced hemostasis and associated thrombotic events, the high-altitude location of his residence at the time he experienced the seizures, and shallow breathing during sleep.",

    "original_case": "The patient gave her written consent to the anonymous description and publication of her case report. We present the case of an 84-year-old Caucasian woman suffering from severe pain of the left flank of several weeks\u2019 duration. Prior to the patient\u2019s current hospitalization, as reported here, a decompression and stabilization of the lumbar and thoracic spine had been performed 2 months before in a different neurosurgical clinic. In view of the clinical results and continuing severe pain, an extension of the preexisting spinal fusion from the 4th lumbar vertebral body to the second sacral vertebral body, including a cage implantation, was recommended. The patient presented multiple preexisting conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, diabetic polyneuropathy, moderate valvular aortic stenosis, and restless legs syndrome. Further, the patient introduced herself as a member of the community of JWs. For this reason, she was transferred to the local department of anesthesiology to discuss blood-saving techniques as well as the risks accompanying the procedure, as she was not willing to receive any form of blood transfusion. After the patient\u2019s decision to undergo spinal fusion surgery, an interdisciplinary plan based on the three pillars of PBM was made to provide maximum security for the patient\u2019s outcome. Presurgical assessment Prior to surgery, the patient signed an informed consent document and was asked to decide which types of blood products would be compatible with her beliefs (Additional file 1: Table S1). Initially, the patient\u2019s hemoglobin (Hb) level was 11.5 g/dl, which could be raised to 12.6 g/dl for the day of surgery by substituting iron-II-glycin-sulfate (100 mg/d). Additionally, blood sampling was reduced to a minimum, and the surgical procedure was thoroughly and interdisciplinarily planned. Alongside with cell savage techniques, anesthetic management focused on the third pillar of PBM, aiming for cardiopulmonary optimization by using a machine learning monitoring tool and a hemodynamic goal-directed therapy (GDT) protocol. The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) was established by Edwards Lifesciences (Irvine, California, USA) and is certified in the United States and Europe for hemodynamic monitoring. It aims to predict phases of intraoperative hypotension (IOH, defined as MAP < 65 mmHg for at least one minute) up to 15 min before their onset. The scale ranges from 0 to 100%, indicating the likelihood of and remaining time to pending IOH. Our hypothesis was that unnecessary volume expansion could be avoided by using the HPI-based GDT because additional fluids would only be given when the patient would be volume responsive and simultaneously be at risk for IOH. This approach should therefore prevent unnecessary hemodilution. Induction of anesthesia, hemodynamic, and intraoperative management The patient received a standard induction of anesthesia using sufentanil (0.52 \u03bcg/kg), propofol (1.67 mg/kg), and cis-Atracurium (0.21 mg/kg). The maintenance of anesthesia was performed as total intravenous anesthesia using propofol (6\u201312 mg/kg/h) as continuous infusion and sufentanil (0.1\u20130.3 \u03bcg/kg) as intermittent bolus injection. The total duration of surgery was 425 min. To compensate for blood loss, a mechanical autotransfusion system (CellSaver\u00ae, Haemonetics Corporation, Boston, USA) was used during the whole course of surgery. For hemodynamic management, an HPI-based GDT-algorithm was used . Since unnecessary hemodilution, also in GDT-treated patients, would lead to an unfavorable outcome, especially in the presented patient, we chose a more fluid-restrictive GDT. First, before the induction of anesthesia, the baseline cardiac index (CI) as well as the stroke volume were determined by implementing an arterial line in the awake patient. If HPI was raised over 70%, hemodynamic intervention was performed according to the algorithm. More specifically, if stroke volume variation (SVV) increased over 14%, a colloid bolus injection using 100 ml of gelatin infusion (Gelafundine\u00ae, B. Braun Germany) was applied over 5 min. If HPI did not decrease, the injection was repeated until HPI declined < 80% or SVV < 14%, whichever occurred first. If HPI persistently leveled > 80% despite a successful fluid challenge (defined as SVV < 14%), CI was raised when it was below the baseline value with dobutamine (5 \u03bcg/kg/min, half dose if heart rate was raised > 100 bpm). If still no reduction of HPI could be achieved after successful fluid challenge and CI optimization, noradrenaline or theodrenaline/cafedrine (Akrinor\u00ae) was used to maintain a MAP > 70 mmHg. Fig. 1 Hypotension Prediction Index-based hemodynamic treatment algorithm. CI: Cardiac Index; HPI: Hypotension Prediction Index; MAP: Mean Arterial Pressure; SVV: Stroke Volume Variation Full size image By adhering to the GDT algorithm, a sufficient hemodynamic stability was achieved throughout the surgery. The patient received a total of 2500 ml colloid infusion, maximum rates of 0.13 \u00b5g/kg/min of noradrenaline, 0.5 ml of theodrenaline/cafedrine, and no further cardiac support medication. The patient never showed signs of low pH or negative BE despite a blood loss of 2.4 L (). It was possible to reinfuse 1007 ml of the patient\u2019s own blood that was saved by the autotransfusion system. To prevent hypofibrinolytic bleeding, tranexamic acid was infused intraoperatively, starting with a bolus of 20 mg/kg/h for 1 hour and continuing with an infusion of 4 mg/kg/h for the remaining time of surgery. Once bleeding started to intensify, point-of-care thrombelastography (ROTEM\u00ae, TEM Innovations, Munich, Germany) was used to detect coagulatory alterations, which resulted in the substitution of 3 g fibrinogen.

Fig. 1 Computed tomography scan showing very large pericardial effusion and possibly reflecting the presence of cardiac tamponade. There is moderate right posterior pleural effusion Full size image There was a spiculated anterior subpleural lesion measuring 28 mm extending to the anterolateral pleural surface of the right upper lobe  and significant enlargement of the mediastinal with right paratracheal lymph node measuring 15 mm and subcarinal lymph node measuring 18 mm and left axillary lymph nodes measuring 12.5 mm. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis was carried out. Fig. 2 Computed tomography scan showing right upper lobe speculated anterior subpleural lesion extending on the anterolateral pleural surface, suggesting primary bronchial cancer Full size image The pericardial and pleural fluid cytology contained small numbers of malignant cells, presenting predominately singly in a bloodstained background. These cells have enlarged pleomorphic nuclei with granular to coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive staining of tumor cells for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), napsin A, and Cytokeratin 7 (CK7). Staining for Estrogen receptor (ER), Cytokeratin 20 (CK20), Caudal Type Homeobox 2 (CDX2), and calretinin were all negative. These findings are in support of adenocarcinoma of lung origin. In 2015, the fluid sample sent was not sufficient to undergo further testing to determine PD-L1 expression, immunohistochemistry testing for c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) / anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation, or molecular testing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). She had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 after VATS pleurodesis. The patient quit smoking at the time of diagnosis. She was then commenced on first-line chemotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 5), and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) 3 weekly at T = 1 month in February 2015. She completed four cycles with no dose reduction. Follow-up CT imaging was done 3 months later (T = 4 months) demonstrated good clinical and radiological response. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 [10], complete response was achieved with disappearance of the pleural based right upper lobe lesion. There is complete response to the mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph nodes. She was clinically well with maintenance of her performance status. Given the excellent response after first-line chemotherapy, she was then commenced on maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 every 21 days. This is based on evidence that it prolongs overall survival and progression-free survival [11]. The patient completed eight cycles of pemetrexed without significant toxicities. In December 2015, there was single lesion progression with a new right upper lobe lesion (18 \u00d7 15 mm2) . The patient declined biopsy of this lesion. Given disease progression as per RECIST version 1.1, she was commenced on nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks at around T = 12 months in February 2016 owing to emerging evidence of immunotherapy in this setting for previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Fig. 3 Computed tomography scan showing a right upper lobe lung lesion Full size image After the commencement of immunotherapy, her follow-up scan done in May 2016 showed complete response of single lung lesion as per RECIST version 1.1. Further imaging subsequently every 3 months with CT of brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis continues to show no evidence of recurrence or new metastatic disease. At T = 59 months in November 2019, she had an elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis secondary to multiple cholelithiases. Her nivolumab was not withheld during the surgery, and she did not develop any complications during the perioperative period. At T = 63 months in March 2020, somatic gene mutation analysis was requested on her previous pericardial fluid and tissue sample done early in the diagnosis as the patient was not keen for rebiopsy. Reanalysis of the sample could be done using molecular testing. A mutation was detected in the KRAS gene p.(Gly12Cys): G12C (16%). No clinically relevant mutation was found in the tested regions of EGFR, BRAF, MET, RET, or ERBB2. It was negative for rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 genes. There was high level PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 80%. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan at T = 83 months in November 2021 showed no suspicious fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake within lungs. The foci of intense FDG uptake surrounding right lung pleura is consistent with a previous talc pleurodesis . Fig. 4 FDG-PET scan showing no suspicious FDG uptake within lungs.

Fig. 3 Computed tomography scan showing a right upper lobe lung lesion Full size image After the commencement of immunotherapy, her follow-up scan done in May 2016 showed complete response of single lung lesion as per RECIST version 1.1. Further imaging subsequently every 3 months with CT of brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis continues to show no evidence of recurrence or new metastatic disease. At T = 59 months in November 2019, she had an elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis secondary to multiple cholelithiases. Her nivolumab was not withheld during the surgery, and she did not develop any complications during the perioperative period. At T = 63 months in March 2020, somatic gene mutation analysis was requested on her previous pericardial fluid and tissue sample done early in the diagnosis as the patient was not keen for rebiopsy. Reanalysis of the sample could be done using molecular testing. A mutation was detected in the KRAS gene p.(Gly12Cys): G12C (16%). No clinically relevant mutation was found in the tested regions of EGFR, BRAF, MET, RET, or ERBB2. It was negative for rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 genes. There was high level PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 80%. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan at T = 83 months in November 2021 showed no suspicious fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake within lungs. The foci of intense FDG uptake surrounding right lung pleura is consistent with a previous talc pleurodesis . Fig. 4 FDG-PET scan showing no suspicious FDG uptake within lungs.

    "original_case": "A 50-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of \u201cburning\u201d pain in his right foot. He had a background history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Grave\u2019s disease that required partial thyroidectomy, alcohol dependency, and a 30-pack year history of smoking. His atrial fibrillation was managed with metoprolol only, a cardio-selective beta blocker, and his thyroid function was supplemented with levothyroxine. There had been no recent new medications commenced. There was no known prior history of peripheral vascular disease or diabetes. On examination, his right foot was cool to touch without discoloration or tissue loss. He had a strong posterior tibialis pulse and an absent dorsalis pedis pulse. There was reduced sensation in both feet due to longstanding alcoholic peripheral neuropathy; lower limb motor function was intact. His left lower limb had a full complement of pulses. Doppler assessment by his bedside showed a triphasic signal over the right mid anterior tibial artery, indicating normal flow, but confirmed the absence of arterial flow through the dorsalis pedis artery on the right foot. Computerized tomographic angiography from the arch of the aorta to the lower limbs confirmed the examination findings, demonstrating patent right posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, and a right anterior tibial artery that occluded distally with no flow into the dorsalis pedis artery . The right foot vascular arch was preserved, with the main inflow being via the posterior tibial artery. There was no large vessel occlusion proximally in the thigh, and no aortoiliac abnormalities. Given the chronicity of the symptoms and investigation findings, his right foot pain was attributed to alcohol-related neuropathy and the patient was discharged from hospital with lifestyle modifying advice. Subsequently, he had presented to the emergency department on several occasions over the following few days with the same complaint. Two consecutive blood investigations including total leukocyte counts, neutrophil percentage, and hemoglobin levels were within normal values, while platelet counts on both occasions were marginally elevated at 549 \u00d7 10^9/L and 440 \u00d7 10^9/L, respectively. Furthermore, blood coagulation profiles, which included activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratios were within normal limits on both occasions. With similar examination findings to his previous admissions and normal biochemical markers, he was again discharged with analgesic medication. A week later, he was brought into the emergency department with acute confusion, bilateral foot pain, hyponatremia, and elevated inflammatory markers. This time his total leukocyte count was elevated at 18 \u00d7 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration was 119 g/L, platelet count was 350 \u00d7 10^9/L, and the hematocrit assay was 0.35/L, which remained unchanged from hematocrit values at previous visits. Likewise, coagulation profiles remained normal. A septic workup, which included a lumbar puncture, did not reveal an obvious infective cause. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were unremarkable. Lower limb venous Doppler assessment was negative for deep venous thromboses. His hyponatremia was appropriately corrected with fluid restriction resulting in resolution of confusion. However, on this occasion, he complained of worsening pain in both feet with a rapid onset of new livedo reticularis of both feet. At presentation, the working diagnosis was of a cardioembolic phenomenon in the context of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and he was commenced on therapeutic anticoagulation. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram did not show an intramural thrombus or a patent foramen ovale. Fig. 1 CT-angiography of the lower limbs demonstrating the right anterior tibial artery occluding in the distal leg (white arrow) with a patent right posterior tibial artery (yellow arrow). Note normal arteriogram of the left leg Full size image The following day, the patient\u2019s condition and limb pain worsened; he had \u201ctrash feet\u201d and new motor dysfunction of the feet. Overnight, his lower limb ischemia had worsened rapidly to the point where revascularization was no longer a viable option. A repeat CT-angiogram of the lower limbs showed absent arterial flow of contrast bilaterally below the mid-leg, with no evidence of aortic or large vessel pathology . He was deemed to have non-salvageable Rutherford Grade 3 acute limb ischemia in bilateral lower limbs below the knees. To avoid the complication of multiorgan failure that may have resulted from release of myoglobin, intramuscular potassium, and inflammatory cytokines, he underwent emergent bilateral above-knee amputations, with satisfactory improvement in his clinical status.

However, the indicator to search for another diagnosis of acute bilateral arterial occlusion of his leg arteries was a positive direct antiglobulin test that indicated the presence of cold agglutinins in his blood. This was performed during blood grouping before major surgical intervention. These findings led to further serological testing, including serum immunofixation electrophoresis. This indicated the presence of a monoclonal B cell population involving 32% of his total lymphocyte count, as well as a mixed IgM Kappa and IgM Lambda cryoglobulinemia, an indication for bone marrow assessment.",

Upon arrival at the facility and during the medical screening, he complained of persistent intractable epigastric pain, along with pleuritic chest pain with multiple episodes of vomiting over the previous 4 days. He further complained of dysphagia and odynophagia. At the time, he denied any past medical history and/or swallowing any foreign body. He admitted to smoking marijuana on a daily basis. During the initial care, he was given ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg tablets and 30 mg of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium solution as well as two hydroxide/simethicone tablets orally. The patient subsequently became more subjectively comfortable, but the chest pain continued to persist. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was done during the same period and was evaluated by the on-call physician as being suspicious for acute pericarditis .\n\nOn the basis of the assessment by the on-call physician, he was transferred to a local emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. In the first ED, physical examination indicated a normotensive, mildly tachycardic patient with moderate epigastric pain and otherwise normal physical examination. He admitted that his vomiting has improved but he still continues to have dysphagia. The patient underwent a series of laboratory tests that included complete blood count, serological liver function tests, a complete serum chemistry panel, and a computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. The initial laboratory findings were significant for a mild leukocytosis, and the CT revealed pericholecystic fluid, distal esophageal edema, and dilation with questionable air in the esophageal wall, and possible hiatal hernia .\n\nThe repeated EKG in the ED confirmed the possible diagnosis of pericarditis as well as concern for possible cholecystitis. Subsequently, the patient was transferred for a higher level of care to a regional medical center for further evaluation. During the course of care at the new ED, the patient continued to present with tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and persistent epigastric and chest pain. The patient\u2019s EKG continued to show diffuse ST elevation, while his cardiac markers remained within normal limits. Chest X-ray revealed a questionable infiltrate. Formal right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and showed gallbladder wall thickening near the fundus of unclear etiology but no gallstones and was otherwise normal.

Troponin and the remainder of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were grossly unremarkable.\n\nThe patient was treated with 2 liter of normal saline intravenously and 4 mg Zofran intravenously. Pain medication of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg orally as well as famotidine (Pepcid) 20 mg orally and gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail (aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/lidocaine) 30 ml orally were given. Additionally, the patient was given ceftazidime 1 g intravenously and azithromycin 500 mg orally. While in the ED, he continued to deny swallowing a foreign body or ingesting chemicals that may have caused his symptoms. Upon further review of the patient\u2019s symptoms, imaging studies, laboratory results, and recommendation by the surgery team, the patient was transferred to a nearby pediatric subspecialty hospital for further evaluation by pediatric surgery and gastroenterology and possible endoscopic evaluation of his esophagus.\n\nOn arrival to the pediatric subspecialty hospital, he continued to be tachycardic, but afebrile. In the ED, he received 4.5 gram (g) piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), 20 mg Pepcid, and 4 mg Zofran, all intravenously. He immediately underwent an esophagram with water-soluble contrast that revealed a filling defect in the distal esophagus. After further questioning by the pediatric surgery team, he admitted that he had swallowed \u201ca bag\u201d prior to his arrest but would not disclose the contents of the bag. Subsequently, he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and a plastic bag was discovered in the distal esophagus and removed .\n\nPatient was hospitalized with antibiotic therapy with intravenous Zosyn 3.375 g every 8 hours for suspected aspiration pneumonia and transitioned to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) 875 mg tablets on the third day post-procedure for an additional 7 days of treatment. The patient also continued on 20 mg oral Pepcid twice a day. Further evaluation by pediatric cardiology and repeated EKG confirmed the diagnosis of pericarditis, likely post-infectious in etiology. His esophagus also showed evidence of achalasia, which was attributed to the prolonged irritation of the epithelial surface and the inflammation in the surrounding region.\n\nWhile awaiting for the outpatient follow-up, 7 days after discharge, he returned to the local ED with persistent left-sided chest pain and dyspnea worsened with exertions and wheezing. The patient was noted to have significant leukocytosis, and a CT of his chest revealed a left-sided loculated hydropneumothorax with central cavitary lesion. He was then transferred back to the pediatric surgery service at the same subspecialty hospital for further evaluation. Given concern for esophageal perforation, a repeat esophagram was performed showing normal esophageal caliber and contour without extravasation of contrast. The patient was then admitted to pediatric service with placement of a thoracostomy tube by the interventional radiology service. He received 4 days of thrombolytic therapy via the thoracostomy with satisfactory output. The thoracostomy tube was removed 10 days later. Infectious disease was also consulted and agreed with an antibiotic regimen of intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin during his course in the hospital.",
    "rewritten_case": "A 16-year-old Hispanic male was booked into a county juvenile detention and rehabilitation facility. Upon arrival at the facility and during the medical screening, he complained of persistent intractable epigastric pain, along with pleuritic chest pain with multiple episodes of vomiting over the previous 4 days. He further complained of dysphagia and odynophagia. At the time, he denied any past medical history and/or swallowing any foreign body. He admitted to smoking marijuana on a daily basis. During the initial care, he was given ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg tablets and 30 mg of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium solution as well as two hydroxide/simethicone tablets orally. The patient subsequently became more subjectively comfortable, but the chest pain continued to persist. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was done during the same period and was evaluated by the on-call physician as being suspicious for acute pericarditis .\n\nOn the basis of the assessment by the on-call physician, he was transferred to a local emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. In the first ED, physical examination indicated a normotensive, mildly tachycardic patient with moderate epigastric pain and otherwise normal physical examination. He admitted that his vomiting has improved but he still continues to have dysphagia. The patient underwent a series of laboratory tests that included complete blood count, serological liver function tests, a complete serum chemistry panel, and a computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. The initial laboratory findings were significant for a mild leukocytosis, and the CT revealed pericholecystic fluid, distal esophageal edema, and dilation with questionable air in the esophageal wall, and possible hiatal hernia .\n\nThe repeated EKG in the ED confirmed the possible diagnosis of pericarditis as well as concern for possible cholecystitis. Subsequently, the patient was transferred for a higher level of care to a regional medical center for further evaluation. During the course of care at the new ED, the patient continued to present with tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and persistent epigastric and chest pain. The patient\u2019s EKG continued to show diffuse ST elevation, while his cardiac markers remained within normal limits. Chest X-ray revealed a questionable infiltrate.

He had no history of smoking or drinking, and there was nothing significant in his family history. Physical examination revealed that his right testicle was elastic, hard, and enlarged to a size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950 mm^3. No obvious lymphadenopathy on the body surface was palpable, and no gynecomastia was found. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and tumor marker levels (AFP, HCG, and LDH) showed no abnormal findings. Ultrasound findings showed a mosaic shadow inside the right testicle with no abnormal findings in the left testicle. Lung CT showed no evidence of coin lesions or effusion .

    "original_case": "Case 1  \nA 13-year-old Iranian boy came to our pediatric emergency department, a referral center affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, with the chief complaint of yellowish skin and two red spots on his right leg. Furthermore, his mother mentioned that he had nosebleeds for a week prior to the admission. He developed icterus 2 months before the admission, and after preliminary laboratory evaluations, which revealed elevated liver enzymes, he was diagnosed with hepatitis. One day before admission, his mother suddenly saw some petechiae-like lesions on his right leg, so she brought the boy to our center. We decided to check CBC and performed liver function tests (LFTs). His preadmission medications included folic acid 5 mg once a day and ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice a day. Physicians had prescribed these drugs because of his previous hepatitis diagnosis. On our primary physical examination, his sclera appeared icteric. He had an ulcer on his lower lip. His lungs were clear, and his heart sounds were normal. On abdominal examination, his liver seemed to be slightly enlarged. He also had evidence of ecchymosis on his right leg.  \nLaboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia on the first CBC [white blood cell count (WBC) 900/\u00b5l, hemoglobin (HB) 7.8 g/dl, platelet count (PLT) 4000/\u00b5l]. His liver enzymes were elevated [aspartate transferase (AST) 68 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 174 U/L, total bilirubin 1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.29 mg/dL, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 26 U/L] as they had been over the past 2 months. Intending to find the cause of his hepatitis, we checked for common viral hepatitis causes, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), which were all negative. We checked anti-LKM antibody (Ab), anti-dsDNA Ab, cANCA, and pANCA to rule out the possibility of autoimmune disorders, though we did not find any of them to be positive. We also checked ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels to rule out Wilson\u2019s disease, and neither was in favor of Wilson. We checked coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM, which were both negative. We also asked about his past drug history (including herbal drugs) and any potential toxin exposure, but we did not find that could have caused hepatitis. Moreover, we performed chromosome breakage test, which was negative, ruling out Fanconi anemia.  \nIn terms of his pancytopenia, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The results showed severe hypocellularity (approximately 15%), which was low for his age. Pictures of bone marrow biopsy and aspiration are shown in Fig. 1. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was done on his bone marrow sample, and there was no evidence of leukemia or lymphoma. Our treatment plan was immunosuppressive therapy (IST). The patient was started on equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (40 mg/kg/day for 4 days), prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day), and cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day). After receiving treatment, his CBC stabilized (enough to discharge the patient from hospital with further follow-up scheduled) 10 days after IST initiation, and eventually, he was discharged in good condition.  \nFig. 1  \nHypocellular smear from bone marrow aspiration revealing a few scattered myeloid cells and lymphocytes. On bone marrow biopsy, which revealed hypocellularity for his age, intertrabecular marrow spaces were shown to have been replaced by fatty cells beside the presence of some nucleated cells, including lymphocytes, plasma cells, and erythroid cells  \nFull size image  \nCase 2  \nAn 8-year-old Iranian boy was brought to our emergency department with the chief complaint of yellowish skin and abdominal distension. He was relatively well until 3 weeks prior to admission. His initial symptoms were anorexia, weakness, and fever, which led him to a medical center. Primary laboratory evaluations were done there, and he was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis on the basis of elevated international normalized ratio (INR). He also had extremely high liver enzymes. At that medical center, he had received supportive care. Then, since our hospital is the referral liver transplant center in Iran, his parents brought him to our emergency department. On initial presentation, he was severely icteric. His abdomen was distended, and ascites and hepatomegaly were observed.  \nOur initial laboratory investigations showed severe elevation of his liver enzymes (AST 1615 U/L, ALT 1880 U/L, total bilirubin 47 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 22.8 mg/dL). At that time, he also had coagulation disorder [prothrombin time (PT) 21.1 seconds and INR 2.5]. Moreover, we detected anemia and mild leukopenia in his CBC, but his platelet count was normal (WBC 2900/\u00b5l, HB 8.3 g/dl, PLT 190,000/\u00b5l). We started searching for the cause of his hepatitis. After checking viral and immunological markers, the only noticeable item we found was a positive COVID-19 IgG Ab. Like the previous patient, he did not report any history of exposure to drugs (including herbal drugs) or hepatotoxic toxins. Moreover, Fanconi anemia was ruled out for the patient by negative chromosome breakage test.  \nDuring the admission course, his situation improved and his liver enzymes began to decrease, but he suddenly developed petechiae on his left hand. So, we immediately checked the CBC, which revealed severe pancytopenia (WBC 500/\u00b5l, HB 7.1g/dl, PLT 20,000/\u00b5l). His platelet count dropped drastically. Therefore, we planned for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and the result showed severe hypocellularity, approximately 20%. Pictures of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are shown in Fig. 1.  \nSince his WBC count was very low, we could not consider a bone marrow transplant, and we decided to try immunosuppressive therapy for him, as the other patient had responded well to it. Unfortunately, after receiving the third dose of ATG, he had an episode of generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure, and he did not show any response to the treatment until that time. Hence, we stopped the chemotherapy and transferred him to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) ward. Unfortunately, he was declared brain dead, due to the low platelet number and coagulopathy.

    "original_case": "A 72-year-old Caucasian female patient, with a history of 40 years of smoking without any comorbidities presented with a non-healing, ulcerated lesion on the inner canthus of the left eye at the ophthalmology clinic. Surgical excision of the lesion was carried out in April 2008, with limited excision margins. The histological diagnosis was made. After being asymptomatic for 4 years, the tumor relapsed and the patient underwent a second surgical excision in August 2012. Resection was incomplete, with positive margins, so the patient underwent another surgery to have the tumor removed; however, histological diagnosis once again showed evidence of positive margins. Finally, radiation therapy was chosen as definitive treatment for the patient. Between December 2012 and January 2013, the patient received irradiation in 2-Gy fractions on the left halves of the forehead, glabella, nose, and on the left inner periocular eye regions. The patient attended follow-up examinations by the dermatologist every 6 months. Physical examination of the patient and an MRI scan of the affected area were carried out. The patient remained symptom free until 2018.\n\nIn June 2016, the patient presented with hematuria and was subsequently admitted to the urology clinic for cystoscopy and transurethral resection (TUR). Histological diagnosis confirmed a condition. Following surgery, the patient did not attend regular follow-up at the urology clinic, only at the dermatology clinic. Until 2018 the patient remained symptom-free.\n\nIn February 2018, the patient once again presented with hematuria at the urology clinic. First cystoscopy, then TUR was performed, and the histological diagnosis confirmed a condition, indicating the relapse and progression of the patient\u2019s tumor. Although both radical cystectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy were considered and offered as treatment options, neither was accepted by the patient.\n\nIn the weeks prior to surgery, once when the patient was blowing her nose, a cavity had spontaneously opened between the inner canthus of the patient\u2019s left eye and the medial meatus of the nasal cavity. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the facial skeleton, the cervical soft tissues, and the upper mediastinal regions was carried out in April 2018. The MRI scan showed evidence of the relapse of the condition on the skin of the inner canthus of the left eye, with the tumor invading the ethmoidal air cells in the left regions of the inner canthus and nasal root, as well as spreading into the nasal cavity and frontal sinus, cranially destroying the rhinobasis. For this advanced, locally invasive disease, the patient was given three cycles of treatment as first-line treatment without any adverse events. A follow-up MRI scan of the region, in September 2018, showed disease progression and the increased destruction of the skin in the left inner canthal region. To ascertain the histological type of the tumor, biopsy of the sinuses was carried out, which confirmed the presence of a condition. Based on the decision of the tumor board, the patient was given eight cycles of chemotherapy between January and September 2019. Follow-up MRI showed stable disease. Throughout the treatment, the patient\u2019s functional status remained ECOG 0, and no side effects were noted. Having reached the maximum cumulative dose of the chemotherapeutic agent, treatment with this agent could not be continued. Approval for a therapy was requested by the tumor board but was denied.\n\nTowards the end of her chemotherapy, in the summer, the patient felt a small lump appear in her left inguinal region, so computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in September 2019 at the urology clinic. Although local recurrence of the condition could not be found, lymph node conglomerates could be detected in the aortic and left parailiac regions, and a soft tissue lesion in the left adrenal gland raised the possibility of a condition. Ultrasound core biopsy was performed from the left suprainguinal lymph node conglomerates, with the subsequent histological diagnosis confirming the metastasis of the condition.\n\nIn November 2019, the patient was referred to the National Institute of Oncology for further oncological treatment. Taking into account the recently completed chemotherapy for the patient\u2019s advanced condition as well as the metastasis of the condition, the tumor board recommended the administration of a therapy.\n\nBetween December 2019 and 2020, the patient was given cycles of treatment. Although not a requirement for second-line therapy, staining was carried out for tissue samples from both types of cancer. The sample tested positive for a marker, with a percentage of expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells, while the sample from the lymph node metastasis showed 0%.\n\nThe patient tolerated treatment well; she did not experience any adverse or side effects. Her blood tests were normal, and her performance status remained good (ECOG 0) throughout the treatment. Follow-up abdominal, chest, and pelvis CT scans in both February and June 2020 showed the regression of the lymph node conglomerates, while the lesion in the left adrenal gland remained stable, altogether indicating the regression of the patient\u2019s condition. Response to therapy was evaluated according to the criteria. CT scans of these regions showed evidence of complete remission in September and later on in December 2020 as well. Follow-up MRI scan of the facial skeleton and cervical region in September showed evidence of stable disease.\n\nOn 30 January 2021, the patient presented with symptoms of dehydration and arrhythmia at the emergency department. She was diagnosed with a condition, and was found to be COVID-19 positive. Over the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, she developed bilateral pneumonia, became somnolent and died. The cause of her death was considered to be due to the complications of COVID-19 infection.",

    "original_case": "A 16-month-old Sri Lankan boy presented with sudden-onset difficulty in breathing for 1-day duration. He had a febrile illness with coryzal symptoms for 3 days, which had resolved 2 days prior to this presentation. There was no history of foreign-body aspiration or trauma. He was born to non-consanguineous parents at term and had an uneventful neonatal period. He did not have any previous hospital admissions or recurrent wheezing episodes and was developmentally normal. On examination, the child was afebrile and not pale or cyanosed. His weight was 8.8 kg (between \u22121SD and \u22122SD), and his length was 82 cm (between median and +1SD). He had moderate respiratory distress with subcostal, intercostal, and suprasternal recessions, and his respiratory rate was 50 breaths per minute. He had a loud expiratory grunt. The chest expansion was reduced on the right side, which was dull to percussion. Auscultation revealed a marked reduction of air entry over the lower and mid zones of the right chest; there were no added sounds. His arterial oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a pulse rate of 140 per minute and blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg. The apex was felt at the fifth intercostal space lateral to the midclavicular line, and his heart sounds were normal. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. Urgent chest X-ray performed due to lateralizing physical signs showed a well-demarcated opacity involving the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax associated with a tracheal shift to the opposite side . The right heart and diaphragmatic borders were obliterated. Ultrasound scan of the chest revealed fluid-filled right hemithorax suggesting a septate pleural effusion. His full blood count revealed white cell count of 17,000/mm3 (neutrophils 7300/mm3, lymphocytes 8100/mm3, eosinophils 300/mm3), hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 607,000/mm3. His C-reactive protein was 10.5 mg/L. His serum electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were normal. He was treated for a possible right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic pleural effusion with intravenous cefotaxime 50 mg/kg 8 hourly. Fig. 1 Chest X-ray showing well-demarcated opacity in the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax with shifting of the trachea to the left side Full size image Due to the absence of fever, negative inflammatory markers, and the unusual nature of the chest X-ray, which led to diagnostic uncertainty, an urgent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the thorax was performed on the following day . This showed a large multiloculated extrapulmonary cystic lesion involving the right hemithorax with a mediastinal shift towards the left side. This was associated with the displacement of the right-side mediastinal structures, including superior and inferior vena cava, narrowing of the right main pulmonary artery, and compression of the right lung superiorly. The lung parenchyma was normal. The CT appearance was in favor of a benign cystic lesion in the mediastinum. The echocardiography was normal.

The right lung is compressed superiorly, and the right main pulmonary artery is narrowed Full size image He initially underwent ultrasound-guided aspiration of cyst fluid for immediate relief of respiratory distress. Analysis of aspiration fluid revealed clusters of pulmonary macrophages and lymphocytes in the background of blood with necrotic material and no malignant cells. However, the response to aspiration was short-lasting due to re-accumulation of cyst fluid. A week later, he underwent a mini-thoracotomy and surgical excision of the cyst.

    "rewritten_case": "A 16-month-old Sri Lankan boy presented with sudden-onset difficulty in breathing for 1-day duration. He had a febrile illness with coryzal symptoms for 3 days, which had resolved 2 days prior to this presentation. There was no history of foreign-body aspiration or trauma. He was born to non-consanguineous parents at term and had an uneventful neonatal period. He did not have any previous hospital admissions or recurrent wheezing episodes and was developmentally normal. On examination, the child was afebrile and not pale or cyanosed. His weight was 8.8 kg (between \u22121SD and \u22122SD), and his length was 82 cm (between median and +1SD). He had moderate respiratory distress with subcostal, intercostal, and suprasternal recessions, and his respiratory rate was 50 breaths per minute. He had a loud expiratory grunt. The chest expansion was reduced on the right side, which was dull to percussion. Auscultation revealed a marked reduction of air entry over the lower and mid zones of the right chest; there were no added sounds. His arterial oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a pulse rate of 140 per minute and blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg. The apex was felt at the fifth intercostal space lateral to the midclavicular line, and his heart sounds were normal. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. Urgent chest X-ray performed due to lateralizing physical signs showed a well-demarcated opacity involving the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax associated with a tracheal shift to the opposite side . The right heart and diaphragmatic borders were obliterated. Ultrasound scan of the chest revealed fluid-filled right hemithorax suggesting a septate pleural effusion. His full blood count revealed white cell count of 17,000/mm3 (neutrophils 7300/mm3, lymphocytes 8100/mm3, eosinophils 300/mm3), hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 607,000/mm3. His C-reactive protein was 10.5 mg/L. His serum electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were normal. He was treated for a possible right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic pleural effusion with intravenous cefotaxime 50 mg/kg 8 hourly. Fig. 1 Chest X-ray showing well-demarcated opacity in the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax with shifting of the trachea to the left side Full size image Due to the absence of fever, negative inflammatory markers, and the unusual nature of the chest X-ray, which led to diagnostic uncertainty, an urgent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the thorax was performed on the following day . This showed a large multiloculated extrapulmonary cystic lesion involving the right hemithorax with a mediastinal shift towards the left side. This was associated with the displacement of the right-side mediastinal structures, including superior and inferior vena cava, narrowing of the right main pulmonary artery, and compression of the right lung superiorly. The lung parenchyma was normal. The CT appearance was in favor of a benign cystic lesion in the mediastinum. The echocardiography was normal. Fig. 2 Contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest showing a large multiloculated extrapulmonary cystic lesion (measuring 11.5 cm\u2009\u00d7\u200911.3 cm\u2009\u00d7\u20099.5 cm) involving the right hemithorax with a mediastinal shift towards the left and mass effect and displacement of the right-side mediastinal structures. The right lung is compressed superiorly, and the right main pulmonary artery is narrowed Full size image He initially underwent ultrasound-guided aspiration of cyst fluid for immediate relief of respiratory distress. Analysis of aspiration fluid revealed clusters of pulmonary macrophages and lymphocytes in the background of blood with necrotic material and no malignant cells. However, the response to aspiration was short-lasting due to re-accumulation of cyst fluid. A week later, he underwent a mini-thoracotomy and surgical excision of the cyst. During surgery, he was intubated with a size 4.5 endotracheal tube and provided pressure-controlled ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure of 18, peak end-expiratory pressure of 6, and respiratory rate of 25.

It is noteworthy that the patient reported having chronic lumbar pain for the past 3 months, yet the last few weeks were marked by hyperalgesia without a history of trauma. She complained of night sweating but had no fever, chills, cough, or dyspnea. However, the patient recalled a 1-week history of fever 1 month ago, after taking the second dose of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. She was admitted to the hospital on the same day, and was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases for adequate investigation and management. The patient was known to have hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism\u2014all treated with medications. She also had a history of lumbar L4\u2013L5 disc herniation, for which arthrodesis was performed 4 years ago. She reported a history of unpasteurized dairy product consumption. Owing to the fact that Lebanon is an endemic area for brucellosis, the presence of chronic symptoms with a recent exacerbation shed light on the plausibility of infection with spinal involvement. On physical examination, her temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure 150/80 mmHg, and pulse 105 beats per minute. We noted a painful percussion of the lumbar spine at L3/L4 as well as painful passive mobilization and lumbar paravertebral tenderness. No lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly could be observed. On neurological examination, the range of motion was not decreased for lower extremities; neither sensory deficits nor sphincter abnormalities were present. The performed blood tests were indicative of inflammation: hemoglobin 9.4 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm per hour, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 70 mg/l. White blood cell count was 6410/\u03bcl, and leukocyte formula showed 56% neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes, and 7% monocytes. Blood chemistry was within the normal values. Bacterial serology indicated that anti-antibodies were positive at a titer of 1/5120 (reference range 1/180).

    "original_case": "An 89-year-old Caucasian woman accidentally drank a sip of a chemical while visiting her laundry, which had been carelessly poured into a bottle of water. Her medical record included a surgical aortic valve replacement, triple coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and arterial hypertension. The family described her as being completely autonomous at home, as proved by the fact that she worked in her own dry cleaning shop until the age of 88. The exact amount of ingested chemical is still uncertain owing to the high variability of product concentration and the proprietary formulas used by the different brands. However, the patient later described having just a sip before realizing, based on the taste, that it was not water. Around 10 minutes after ingestion she became drowsy and the emergency medical service was activated by her relatives. When she arrived at the emergency room, approximately 50 minutes after the ingestion, her vitals were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, SpO2 96%, respiratory rate of 34 breaths/minute with a snoring breathing, heart rate of 51 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. The first blood-gas analysis did not show relevant abnormalities: pH of 7.38 and lactate 2.4 mmol/L. The poison control center was immediately contacted and promptly provided the available information regarding the chemical toxicity: it is not caustic; it is a fat-soluble product, which tends to accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS); its half-life is extremely variable and uncertain in humans, with an estimated biological half-life of 144 hours; and its immediate life-threatening aspects are CNS and respiratory drive depression, and risk of cardiac arrhythmias, possibly owing to myocardial sensitization to endogenous and exogenous catecholamines. No antidote is available for the chemical. Characteristics of the chemical intoxication are summarized in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overview of chemical characteristics and toxicity Full size image The sudden and deep CNS depression led the whole team to presume that a large quantity of the chemical had been ingested and that its effects on the CNS could presumably last for several days. This scenario would have led to prolonged mechanical ventilation, a long intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and a high risk of ICU-related complications, especially considering the patient\u2019s advanced age. After a team evaluation, the patient was intubated and admitted to the ICU. Intubation was devoid of any complication; however, the patient developed severe hypoxemia, with the need to increase FiO2 up to 1. After 4 hours of mechanical ventilation, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was 70 mmHg with an FiO2 of 0.6 [ratio between partial pressure of oxygen and FiO2 (PaO2:FiO2) of 117]. Oxygenation improved in the following 3\u20134 hours, reaching an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 155 mmHg at FiO2 of 0.6 (PaO2:FiO2 of 258). The patient showed some hemodynamic instability and required fluid resuscitation with 3000 ml of crystalloids infused over the first 4 hours. The concentration of lactate was rapidly normalized and the patient had a normal urinary output. Five hours after the accidental ingestion, two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia occurred, promptly terminated with adenosine. Initially, the patient remained comatose, with a GCS of 3. During the observation in the ICU, her neurological condition started to improve and the patient suddenly woke up and self-extubated herself 12 hours after the ingestion (3 a.m.). Her respiratory function had recovered, she could cough properly and was completely awake. At 8 a.m., her vital signs were as follows: SpO2 98% with 2 L/minute nasal oxygen, respiratory rate of 17 breaths/minute, heart rate of 70 beats/minute despite a brief and self-limiting episode of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 145/50 mmHg, and urinary output 1400 ml from hospital arrival. Less than 24 hours after ingestion she was discharged from the ICU, and 4 days later she was discharged from the hospital. No signs of liver or renal failure appeared, and the only complication during her hospital stay was a single episode of blood in the sputum. A blood and urine sample taken immediately after the discharge from the ICU was sent to the forensic toxicology department of the University of Milano for a quantitative measurement of the chemical. The results were as follows: blood concentration 9.45 ng/ml and urine concentration 25.5 ng/mg.",
    "rewritten_case": "An 89-year-old Caucasian woman accidentally drank a sip of a chemical while visiting her laundry, which had been carelessly poured into a bottle of water. Her medical record included a surgical aortic valve replacement, triple coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and arterial hypertension. The family described her as being completely autonomous at home, as proved by the fact that she worked in her own dry cleaning shop until the age of 88. The exact amount of ingested chemical is still uncertain owing to the high variability of product concentration and the proprietary formulas used by the different brands. However, the patient later described having just a sip before realizing, based on the taste, that it was not water. Around 10 minutes after ingestion she became drowsy and the emergency medical service was activated by her relatives. When she arrived at the emergency room, approximately 50 minutes after the ingestion, her vitals were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, SpO2 96%, respiratory rate of 34 breaths/minute with a snoring breathing, heart rate of 51 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. The first blood-gas analysis did not show relevant abnormalities: pH of 7.38 and lactate 2.4 mmol/L. The poison control center was immediately contacted and promptly provided the available information regarding the chemical toxicity: it is not caustic; it is a fat-soluble product, which tends to accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS); its half-life is extremely variable and uncertain in humans, with an estimated biological half-life of 144 hours; and its immediate life-threatening aspects are CNS and respiratory drive depression, and risk of cardiac arrhythmias, possibly owing to myocardial sensitization to endogenous and exogenous catecholamines. No antidote is available for the chemical. Characteristics of the chemical intoxication are summarized in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overview of chemical characteristics and toxicity Full size image The sudden and deep CNS depression led the whole team to presume that a large quantity of the chemical had been ingested and that its effects on the CNS could presumably last for several days. This scenario would have led to prolonged mechanical ventilation, a long intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and a high risk of ICU-related complications, especially considering the patient\u2019s advanced age. After a team evaluation, the patient was intubated and admitted to the ICU. Intubation was devoid of any complication; however, the patient developed severe hypoxemia, with the need to increase FiO2 up to 1. After 4 hours of mechanical ventilation, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was 70 mmHg with an FiO2 of 0.6 [ratio between partial pressure of oxygen and FiO2 (PaO2:FiO2) of 117]. Oxygenation improved in the following 3\u20134 hours, reaching an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 155 mmHg at FiO2 of 0.6 (PaO2:FiO2 of 258). The patient showed some hemodynamic instability and required fluid resuscitation with 3000 ml of crystalloids infused over the first 4 hours. The concentration of lactate was rapidly normalized and the patient had a normal urinary output. Five hours after the accidental ingestion, two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia occurred, promptly terminated with adenosine. Initially, the patient remained comatose, with a GCS of 3. During the observation in the ICU, her neurological condition started to improve and the patient suddenly woke up and self-extubated herself 12 hours after the ingestion (3 a.m.). Her respiratory function had recovered, she could cough properly and was completely awake. At 8 a.m., her vital signs were as follows: SpO2 98% with 2 L/minute nasal oxygen, respiratory rate of 17 breaths/minute, heart rate of 70 beats/minute despite a brief and self-limiting episode of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 145/50 mmHg, and urinary output 1400 ml from hospital arrival.

    "original_case": "A 1-year old Pakistani origin male child with Down\u2019s syndrome, presented with gradual enlargement of the head, and developmental regression over the last few months. He was born at 38 weeks via vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy to nonconsanguineous parents (mother 33 years old, and father 38 years old). His birth weight was 2.95 kg, length was 52 cm, and head circumference was 35 cm. His Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score was 7 at 1 minute, and 10 at 5 minutes. Down\u2019s syndrome was diagnosed soon after birth, based on typical facial features and presence of palmar crease, and later confirmed karyotypically for Trisomy 21. His two siblings, aged 6 and 4 years, were alive and healthy. Further social and family history was unremarkable. From a growth standpoint, at birth, he was 10th percentile for weight and 25th percentile for length. At both 6 months and 1 year, he was 25th percentile for weight and 50th percentile for length. His head circumference was 50th percentile at birth, at 6 months it was at 97th percentile, and at 1 year when he presented to the clinic, it was 20 standard deviations (SD) above the 99th percentile. From a growth milestone standpoint, at 9 months, he smiled and laughed at \u201cpeek-a-boo,\u201d lifted arms up to be picked up, crawled, and sat up without support. However, at 12 months, his parents noticed that he cried more, stopped responding to his name, and preferred to lay flat rather than crawl or sit. He was also less vocal and less interested in toys. On physical examination, he appeared to have macrocephaly, along with signs of Down\u2019s syndrome including flat nasal bridge, upward slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthic folds, and simian crease. He appeared to be mildly irritable. Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal, genitourinary, and integumentary examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed intact cranial nerves and sensations to noxious touch. However, there was generalized muscular hypotonia with muscle wasting, with \u22122 bilateral knee and ankle reflexes, and bilateral upgoing plantars. His initial blood tests did not show any abnormality. His hemoglobin (Hb) was 11.5 g/dL and white blood count (WBC) was 13 \u00d7 10^9/L with normal differential. His liver and renal functions were within normal limits. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were also within normal limits. Hepatitis B and C serology were negative. Urinalysis and chest X-ray also did not show any abnormality. He was admitted, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a large cystic tumor in the right parieto temporo occipital regions . Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast showed a 10.9 \u00d7 11.4 \u00d7 8.9 cm, heterogeneously enhancing, mixed solid and cystic supratentorial mass, with surrounding vasogenic edema in the right parieto temporo occipital lobe. The solid component was dural based, measuring 6.4 \u00d7 6.0 cm, showing heterogeneous intensity on T2W imaging with marked enhancement on post-contrast images. There was a midline shift towards the left, with compression on the ipsilateral right lateral ventricle. Moderate obstructive hydrocephalus was also noted (Figs. 2, 3).\n\nFig. 1 A, B Pre-operative CT without contrast: Axial images show a mixed density heterogeneously enhancing mass in the Right posterior parieto temporo occipital locations (red arrows) Full size image Fig. 2 Pre-operative MRI without contrast.

Removal of the posterior dural-based solid mass was omitted due its attachment to the highly vascular dura mater. Postoperative course was uneventful. The tumor specimen was sent for histopathological examination, which revealed low cellularity with intervening bands of fibrous tissue and collagen fibers. Neoplastic cells had a high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio with hyperchromatic nuclei. Some areas showed hypercellular pleomorphism, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation. Some cells with rhabdoid morphology were also present with abnormal mitosis . Staining was performed for integrase interactor 1 (INI-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), desmin, creatine kinase (CK), synaptophysin, and Ki-67. INI-1 came out strongly positive, ruling out atypical teratoid and rhabdoid tumors. A large proportion of tumor cells were positive for GFAP  and negative for synaptophysin, desmin, and CK. Ki-67 index was low in the majority of the tumor. However, areas with increased cellularity had raised Ki-67 to 50%. Morphology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis, which correlated with clinical and radiological findings. Further molecular studies were not done.\n\nFig. 4 A Low-power view highlighting collagenized septa with small cell population having high N/C ratio.

This mass was adherent to the posterior interhemispheric fissure, as well as the tentorium cerebelli (Figs. 7, 8). Keeping in view this extremely rare presentation with growing residual mass adherent to the dura, prospective treatment options were discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board. With recurrence after the initial surgery, the parents were nonconsenting for further surgical intervention, and chose chemotherapy in the hope of controlling further tumor growth and halting subsequent functional decline.\n\nFig. 7 Two months postoperative MRI without contrast.

In the day prior to presentation, she exhibited disorganized speech and delusions that her mother was going to die. In the emergency department, she was overinclusive and talking nonsensically. She was paranoid of security staff, endorsed auditory hallucinations, believed she was at a \u201cs\u00e9ance,\u201d and appeared to be responding to internal stimuli. Consequently, she was admitted to psychiatry for further workup and management. Of note, an emergency physician noted organized speech when she was initially seen, though this was not observed by the psychiatry team.\n\nHer thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at the time of admission was 123.90 mIU/L (reference range 0.20\u20134.00 mIU/L). Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood glucose, and creatinine were all normal. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swab was negative. The patient was on no medications prior to admission and had no history of hypothyroidism or other medical conditions. She had previously been prescribed stimulant medications for ADHD but had not taken any stimulants for months owing to previous intolerance. She denied any substance use, including alcohol and nicotine, leading to her presentation, and urine toxicology screen was negative for amphetamines or other substances.\n\nThe patient was living alone in an apartment prior to being brought to hospital. She had a boyfriend and no children. She was unemployed at the time of admission but was to start a new job working with immigrants. Her mother had a history of hypothyroidism, and the patient was not sure if she had any other family history of thyroid or autoimmune disorders. No family history of other conditions was identified.\n\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms fluctuated when she was seen the day following admission. She initially was more organized and was able to describe experiencing persecutory and religious delusions in the week prior to admission. Nonetheless, she continued to experience delusional beliefs that her mother was going to die. Later in the day, she was noted to be more tangential and was unable to answer questions.\n\nWhen seen by the endocrinology consult team, the patient reported experiencing cold intolerance, fatigue, dry skin, poor appetite, and hair loss. She did not notice any weight gain. She reported feeling her voice was weaker and that she felt like she had a frog in her throat. The patient reported that she had previously been diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis but that this had not been felt to be sufficiently severe to require treatment at that time. While documentation from a previous assessment is unavailable, the patient was noted to have an elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase result (67.1 kIU/L, reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L) approximately 5 years prior, with TSH within normal limits, and this may have been why she had been evaluated as not requiring treatment. On physical examination, she had a slightly enlarged thyroid gland, hyperreflexia, and mild tremor. Notably, delayed relaxation or diminished deep tendon reflexes are typically observed in previous case reports, and it is unclear why hyperreflexia and mild tremor were observed on physical examination in this case. It is possible that this finding was erroneous; however, further description of findings in cases may provide more clarity. Cardiac examination was unremarkable, and no nail changes were observed. Additional blood work showed decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) of 0.9 nmol/L (reference range 1.1\u20132.8 nmol/L), free T3 of 2.8 pmol/L (reference range 3.5\u20136.5 pmol/L), and free thyroxine (T4) of 4.6 pmol/L (reference range 10.0\u201325.0 pmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies were elevated at 147.6 kIU/L (reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L). Anti-thyroglobulin antibody and thyroglobulin levels were within normal limits. Neck ultrasound described a heterogeneous, hyperemic, non-enlarged thyroid gland with hypoechoic nodules abutting the posterior aspect and inferior aspects of the thyroid gland.",
    "rewritten_case": "A 40-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression was brought to hospital with a 7-day history of anxiety and little to no sleep. In the day prior to presentation, she exhibited disorganized speech and delusions that her mother was going to die. In the emergency department, she was overinclusive and talking nonsensically. She was paranoid of security staff, endorsed auditory hallucinations, believed she was at a \u201cs\u00e9ance,\u201d and appeared to be responding to internal stimuli. Consequently, she was admitted to psychiatry for further workup and management. Of note, an emergency physician noted organized speech when she was initially seen, though this was not observed by the psychiatry team.\n\nHer thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at the time of admission was 123.90 mIU/L (reference range 0.20\u20134.00 mIU/L). Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood glucose, and creatinine were all normal. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swab was negative. The patient was on no medications prior to admission and had no history of hypothyroidism or other medical conditions. She had previously been prescribed stimulant medications for ADHD but had not taken any stimulants for months owing to previous intolerance. She denied any substance use, including alcohol and nicotine, leading to her presentation, and urine toxicology screen was negative for amphetamines or other substances.\n\nThe patient was living alone in an apartment prior to being brought to hospital. She had a boyfriend and no children. She was unemployed at the time of admission but was to start a new job working with immigrants. Her mother had a history of hypothyroidism, and the patient was not sure if she had any other family history of thyroid or autoimmune disorders. No family history of other conditions was identified.\n\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms fluctuated when she was seen the day following admission.

She took multiple medications, including ivabradine 5 mg twice daily for symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia, with a baseline heart rate around 110 bpm. After noticing a recent drop in her HR to 50 bpm, she discontinued her ivabradine 10 days prior to presentation. Her heart rate remained in the 50\u201355 bpm range prior to presentation. On arrival, she was afebrile, HR was 55 bpm, BP was 92/55 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Orthostatic vitals were normal, and her physical examination was unremarkable other than a bradycardic pulse with regular rate. Her electrocardiogram (ECG)  demonstrated an ectopic atrial rhythm with HR of 41 bpm (PR interval 120 milliseconds, QRS 80 milliseconds, QTc 397 milliseconds) with overnight telemetry showing sinus arrest and intermittent junctional rhythm.

She worked in the pharmaceutical industry and did not consume tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Her medication list included albuterol inhaler, apixaban, cetirizine, cholecalciferol, clonazepam, cyanocobalamin spray, eszoplicone, fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, ivabradine, sertraline, potassium, and magnesium (Additional file 1).\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for a patient with bradycardia is wide. The first determination in a patient with bradycardia is whether it is the result of conduction abnormalities in the sinus node or the atrioventricular (AV) system. In the presented case, the normal PR interval and the absence of dropped beats suggested no AV conduction disease. Sinus bradycardia can be a manifestation of various intrinsic or extrinsic etiologies. Medications that can exacerbate sinus bradycardia include antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and psychoactive drugs.\n\nInvestigations\nGiven the acute presentation, an acquired cause was suspected. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (3.51 \u03bcIU/mL), AM cortisol (13.3 \u03bcg/dL), serum creatinine (1.2 mg/dL), potassium (4.0 mmol/L), and magnesium (1.9 mg/dL) were normal. A recent echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction and no major structural abnormalities. There were no signs of ischemia or heart failure (troponin T < 0.01 ng/mL, N-terminal pro BNP 64 pg/mL) and no evidence of situational syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. After ruling out common intrinsic and extrinsic causes, a potential cause of her bradycardia was identified. Considering drug interactions, we found no agents on her medication list that exacerbate the effects of ivabradine.\n\nManagement\nGiven her symptoms, ivabradine was withheld and she was discharged from the hospital after 2 days of observation in stable condition with discontinuation of ivabradine. Her heart rate upon ambulation was 70 bpm on discharge. Serum specimens were sent to the Toxicology Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for analysis as measurement of ivabradine levels could not be performed at our institution.

Ivabradine is expected to follow near-linear elimination with a half-life of 6 hours per the manufacturer, while clinical measurements estimate it at 11 hours.

    "original_case": "A 40 kg 9-year-old non-Indigenous Australian female was scheduled for an elective removal of a large right anterior deltoid keloid scar. Her medical history was significant for mild asthma. She had no known allergies, no past surgical or anesthetic history, and no significant family medical history, including no previous general anesthetics in either parent. Medications included regular inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol, with intermittent inhaled salbutamol as required for breakthrough asthma symptoms. She was normally a well and very active child. In the days leading up to her scheduled procedure, she had an intermittent dry cough with no exercise limitation, dyspnea, or fevers. Her preoperative physical examination demonstrated a mild intermittent wheeze in the right anterior basal lung field that resolved with salbutamol administration. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The decision to proceed with general anesthesia was based on a thorough assessment, consideration of all factors, and shared decision making with the family. Two factors leading to a general, rather than regional, anesthesia technique were the size of the lesion (with possibility of local anesthetic toxicity) and a previous traumatic experience when she had direct infiltration of intralesional corticosteroid previously. The patient received no other premedication and was cooperative with preoxygenation prior to an intravenous induction. She received 50 mg of intravenous propofol and 50 \u03bcg of intravenous fentanyl for induction, and was effectively manually ventilated with a circle system during the apneic period. A first-generation laryngeal mask airway (LMA) device was inserted without difficulty with an initial pressure control mode of ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, oxygen, and air (FiO2 0.50), with continuous monitoring of end-tidal capnography, oxygen saturation, heart, and noninvasive blood pressure. The surgical procedure took 30 minutes in the supine position and was uncomplicated. During the maintenance phase of anesthesia, there were no periods of hemodynamic instability, hypoxia, hypercarbia, muscle rigidity, impaired ventilation, or hyperthermia. There were also no obvious abnormalities seen on continuous cardiac telemetry. On emergence from anesthesia, 100 mg of intravenous propofol was given following cessation of sevoflurane to facilitate removal of her LMA under deep anesthesia. The patient subsequently became very difficult to ventilate with high airway pressures, hypoxia, and poor air movement with reduced chest expansion. As an emergency maneuver, her anesthesia was deepened with a further 100 mg of propofol and ongoing manual ventilation attempted with sevoflurane 8% on high flows of 100% oxygen. As this did not improve her ventilation or oxygenation, 50 mg of intravenous suxamethonium was administered with a rapid improvement in ventilation, oxygenation, and airway pressures. Given the rapidity of the situation, the differentials included laryngospasm or bronchospasm with interventions treating both possibilities. Upon recovery of oxygen saturation, chest auscultation demonstrated widespread wheeze initially, treated with in-line salbutamol, which was titrated to effect. She received approximately 1500 \u03bcg of inhaled salbutamol over a 15-minute period. She was supported with positive pressure mask ventilation until safe emergence from anesthesia, then transferred to the pediatric postoperative care unit. Forty-five minutes later in the recovery bay, once completely awake, the patient described right neck pain and lower back pain that prompted a medical review by the anesthetic team. She had a benign cervical spine and musculoskeletal examination, with no red flags. At this stage, reassurance was provided. Two hours later, in the discharge lounge, nursing staff noted an abnormal gait of the patient as she attempted to mobilize to the toilet. On further questioning, the patient was unable to walk unaided and needed full support to stand. A repeat medical review was requested, whereby she was found to have profound proximal lower limb muscle weakness, left lateral thigh pain, and right medial leg pain. She had reduced knee reflexes bilaterally and a broad-based unsteady gait. Her sensory function, upper limb examination, and cranial nerve examination were completely unremarkable. To exclude salbutamol-induced hypokalemia as a possible cause of acute weakness, a venous blood gas was ordered, revealing a mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mmol/L. Having excluded this as a cause, the working diagnosis was suxamethonium-induced myalgia. She was kept for prolonged observation for 3 hours, until her symptoms improved. On discharge, she was able to mobilize unaided. She was provided with strict return precautions if her symptoms deteriorated. The following day, her proximal muscle weakness had returned to involve all four limbs with associated tenderness. She was brought into the emergency department, needing assistance to mobilize. Urgent blood tests revealed a creatinine kinase (CK) of 22,679 units/L, suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Her renal function, electrolytes, and urinalysis were normal. She was admitted for observation with conservative management and resolution of her CK levels over a 4-day period. She had a gradual return to full muscle strength and function over a period of 4 weeks. An anesthetic alert letter was created, addressed to anesthetic, pediatric, and primary care teams to manage this patient until evidence suggested otherwise as sole rhabdomyolysis may reflect a spectrum of this disorder. Given the age of the patient, a muscle biopsy (gold standard test) to definitely identify susceptibility was not performed. Genetic tests were used as an alternative, and detected the following: Gene: RYR1 Genomic location (hg19): chr19:38979901G>A Variant: c.5632G>A Zygosity: heterozygous Classification: 3c\u2014a genetic variant of uncertain significance (VUS) with low clinical relevance. As is the case with genetic testing, this variant may become clinically significant if other cases are found in the future.",

Two factors leading to a general, rather than regional, anesthesia technique were the size of the lesion (with possibility of local anesthetic toxicity) and a previous traumatic experience when she had direct infiltration of intralesional corticosteroid previously. The patient received no other premedication and was cooperative with preoxygenation prior to an intravenous induction. She received 50 mg of intravenous propofol and 50 \u03bcg of intravenous fentanyl for induction, and was effectively manually ventilated with a circle system during the apneic period. A first-generation laryngeal mask airway (LMA) device was inserted without difficulty with an initial pressure control mode of ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, oxygen, and air (FiO2 0.50), with continuous monitoring of end-tidal capnography, oxygen saturation, heart, and noninvasive blood pressure. The surgical procedure took 30 minutes in the supine position and was uncomplicated. During the maintenance phase of anesthesia, there were no periods of hemodynamic instability, hypoxia, hypercarbia, muscle rigidity, impaired ventilation, or hyperthermia. There were also no obvious abnormalities seen on continuous cardiac telemetry. On emergence from anesthesia, 100 mg of intravenous propofol was given following cessation of sevoflurane to facilitate removal of her LMA under deep anesthesia. The patient subsequently became very difficult to ventilate with high airway pressures, hypoxia, and poor air movement with reduced chest expansion. As an emergency maneuver, her anesthesia was deepened with a further 100 mg of propofol and ongoing manual ventilation attempted with sevoflurane 8% on high flows of 100% oxygen. As this did not improve her ventilation or oxygenation, 50 mg of intravenous suxamethonium was administered with a rapid improvement in ventilation, oxygenation, and airway pressures. Given the rapidity of the situation, the differentials included laryngospasm or bronchospasm with interventions treating both possibilities. Upon recovery of oxygen saturation, chest auscultation demonstrated widespread wheeze initially, treated with in-line salbutamol, which was titrated to effect. She received approximately 1500 \u03bcg of inhaled salbutamol over a 15-minute period. She was supported with positive pressure mask ventilation until safe emergence from anesthesia, then transferred to the pediatric postoperative care unit. Forty-five minutes later in the recovery bay, once completely awake, the patient described right neck pain and lower back pain that prompted a medical review by the anesthetic team. She had a benign cervical spine and musculoskeletal examination, with no red flags. At this stage, reassurance was provided. Two hours later, in the discharge lounge, nursing staff noted an abnormal gait of the patient as she attempted to mobilize to the toilet. On further questioning, the patient was unable to walk unaided and needed full support to stand. A repeat medical review was requested, whereby she was found to have profound proximal lower limb muscle weakness, left lateral thigh pain, and right medial leg pain. She had reduced knee reflexes bilaterally and a broad-based unsteady gait. Her sensory function, upper limb examination, and cranial nerve examination were completely unremarkable. To exclude salbutamol-induced hypokalemia as a possible cause of acute weakness, a venous blood gas was ordered, revealing a mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mmol/L. Having excluded this as a cause, the working diagnosis was suxamethonium-induced myalgia. She was kept for prolonged observation for 3 hours, until her symptoms improved. On discharge, she was able to mobilize unaided. She was provided with strict return precautions if her symptoms deteriorated. The following day, her proximal muscle weakness had returned to involve all four limbs with associated tenderness. She was brought into the emergency department, needing assistance to mobilize. Urgent blood tests revealed a creatinine kinase (CK) of 22,679 units/L, suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Her renal function, electrolytes, and urinalysis were normal. She was admitted for observation with conservative management and resolution of her CK levels over a 4-day period. She had a gradual return to full muscle strength and function over a period of 4 weeks. An anesthetic alert letter was created, addressed to anesthetic, pediatric, and primary care teams to manage this patient until evidence suggested otherwise as sole rhabdomyolysis may reflect a spectrum of this disorder. Given the age of the patient, a muscle biopsy (gold standard test) to definitely identify susceptibility was not performed. Genetic tests were used as an alternative, and detected the following: Gene: RYR1 Genomic location (hg19): chr19:38979901G>A Variant: c.5632G>A Zygosity: heterozygous Classification: 3c\u2014a genetic variant of uncertain significance (VUS) with low clinical relevance. As is the case with genetic testing, this variant may become clinically significant if other cases are found in the future.",

On physical examination, the patient appeared to be obese and in significant distress. There was left paraumbilical tenderness along with the guarding but no rebound tenderness. In the emergency room, the patient required multiple doses of intravenous morphine for pain relief. Pertinent laboratory works on admission included: leukocytes 13,900/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 16.3 g/dL, platelet count 720,000/\u03bcL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, lipase 14 U/L, amylase 34 U/L. No significant red cell or platelet abnormalities were noted on the peripheral smear. Urine toxicology was positive for amphetamines and opiates. Urinalysis revealed 1 + ketones, 1 + protein, 3\u20135 red blood cells (RBCs), 0\u20132 white blood cells (WBCs) and was negative for bacteria, leukocyte esterase, and urine nitrite. The patient tested negative for COVID-19. Abdominal ultrasound showed no acute pathology. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed thickening of the left adrenal gland with inflammatory stranding of the surrounding fat and internal hypoenhancement of the gland (Fig. 1 A\u2013C). There was normal density and enhancement of the right adrenal gland. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit for close monitoring for possible hemorrhage or hypotension. Hematology was consulted in the Emergency Department. Per hematology recommendations, the patient was started on a therapeutic dose of Lovenox (enoxaparin-1 mg/kg twice daily) and transitioned to eliquis (apixaban-5 mg twice daily) the next day. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal-sized cavity and normal wall thickness of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 60\u201365%, and normal diastolic function. The cavity size and systolic function of the right ventricle were normal as well. A bubble study was negative for an intracardiac shunt.",

Basic life support was not initiated by the lay bystanders, but was initiated only a few minutes later by a physician hiking nearby and subsequently continued by the medical emergency system personnel who arrived at the scene 15 min after the event. The presenting rhythm was asystole, with a downtime before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of 16 minutes. After ROSC, the patient remained unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3, non-reactive mydriatic pupils, and stable blood pressure and oxygenation values once intubated. During the secondary examination at hospital admission, a cutaneous lesion in the occipital area was noted, described as singed hair with a dominant burning smell, linear in shape, with a small round black eschar, presumably compatible with the first contact with lightning .\n\nThe presence of burnt plastic at the level of the occipital slot of the helmet was consistent with the hypothesis of the eschar being the first contact with lightning. Similar erythematous cutaneous lesions with singed hair were found at the suprapubic level, probably the output area in proximity to the metal core of the bicycle frame through the saddle .\n\nIn addition, the right tympanic membrane was perforated. Ophthalmological assessment was negative. Total body computed tomography (CT) scan showed a modest right apical and temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage, millimeter-sized petechial hemorrhages in the cortical-subcortical junction of the fronto-parietal lobes, and slight signs of initial edema . An abundant hemoperitoneum associated with a bleeding hepatic angioma was present.\n\nThe patient underwent immediate damage control surgery, with abdominal packaging to control the bleeding, and then was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory tests on blood samples revealed elevated biomarkers of myocardial and hepatic injury (high-sensitivity troponin I, 90,879 ng/L; creatine kinase, 1131 U/L; aspartate and alanine transaminases, 361 and 421 U/L, respectively; blood lactate, 11.36 mmol/L). The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with minimal nonspecific ST elevation in the inferior leads, and cardiac ultrasonography showed normokinetic ventricles; no further cardiology investigations were undertaken at that time. Owing to the prolonged time to admission, target controlled temperature management was not established, and the subsequent appearance of fever (from day 2 after ICU admission, mean central body temperature of 38.2 \u00b0C with only one peak at 38.8 \u00b0C) was managed with ice packs, a short period of diclofenac infusion, and then acetaminophen on demand. No prophylactic therapy against vasospasm or brain edema was initiated since serum hyperosmolality was persistently elevated (319 mOsm/L). Following surgery, the patient remained in cardiogenic shock with profound hemodynamic instability and lactic metabolic acidosis. Increasingly higher norepinephrine doses were needed to support arterial pressure, peaking 0.95 mcg/kg/min on day 2. On day 3, after adequate goal-direct volume expansion, terlipressin infusion was added to the treatment regimen (peaking at 1.28 mcg/kg/h). Cardiac function was restored to normal, as demonstrated by a further ultrasound assessment. Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis (noted at admission to the ICU by the elevated levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatine kinase [1131 U]) and oliguria were managed with volume expansion with crystalloids, urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate boluses, and diuretics. A brain CT scan was repeated on day 2, revealing a further reduction of the cortico-subcortical differentiation bilaterally in the frontal-parietal and temporo-occipital areas compatible with anoxic edema, a marked flattening of the cortical convolutions, and the obliteration of the supratentorial peri-encephalic liquor spaces, also at the level of basal cisterns. On day 3, sedation was interrupted to allow for neuroprognostication. A neurological clinical assessment revealed a persisting GCS of 3 and the absence of pupillary and corneal reflexes. Somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated bilateral absence of the cortical somatosensory N20-potential (ERB- and N13-potential were present) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded minimal cerebral electrical activity with very low voltages. On day 4, hemodynamic stability was obtained, allowing for tapering of vasopressor support, and the fever ceased. On day 5, the patient remained unconscious with a GCS of 3 and only a weak cough reflex and respiratory drive. A new EEG revealed an isoelectric trace. A cerebral CT angiography revealed a regular opacification of the arterial circulation with normal venous drainage. Direct scanning highlighted further reduced cortical-subcortical differentiation and marked flattening of brain convolution .\n\nThe patient died on day 10. A post-mortem evaluation revealed signs of multi-organ hypoperfusion, with effects on subendocardial and transmural cardiomyocytes. Cerebral sections confirmed the CT findings of petechiae and subarachnoid hemorrhage previously located along the electrical current and as a result of direct damage to brain vasculature. Brain tissue softening and edema were associated with the direct effects of electrical passage. The cerebral parenchyma sections revealed an abundant, non-selective loss of neurons . We collected detailed medical information from the patient\u2019s relatives, but nothing in his medical history could be related to any previous neurological or cognitive disturbances.",

Symptoms were preceded by 1 day of headache and fever, prompting evaluation at an urgent care center where she was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. On the morning of presentation, she sought further evaluation in the emergency department for symptom progression to chest pain, heavy breathing, and confusion. Pertinent examination findings at presentation included disorientation, combative behavior without focal neurologic deficit, tachycardia, Kussmaul breathing, dry mucus membranes, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 22.3 \u00d7 10\u00b3/mcL), anion-gap metabolic acidosis (pH 6.92, pCO\u2082 < 5 torr, base deficit 28), and hyperglycemia (glucose 668 mg/dL). Urinalysis was significant for ketonuria and glucosuria. Physical examination and laboratory findings were consistent with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C > 16%) complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), likely triggered by acute COVID-19 infection, with features concerning for cerebral edema. She was started on continuous insulin infusion (0.1 units/kg/h), given a bolus of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS), and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further management. DKA was treated according to the institutional protocol with intravenous fluids, continuous insulin infusion, and close electrolyte monitoring.\n\nDue to persistent alteration in mental status shortly after admission, she received two additional HTS boluses and had head computed tomography (CT) scan, which was normal. Despite these interventions and resolution of metabolic derangements, her mentation remained altered. On day 2 of admission, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward. Additional findings were notable for dehiscence of the planum sphenoidale and involvement of the left nasal cavity near superior turbinate, which was concerning for an infectious cerebritis with possible developing phlegmon/intracranial abscess. In the clinical setting of DKA, these findings were concerning for invasive sinusitis with intracranial extension. Lumbar puncture (LP) was subsequently performed on day 2 and revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and negative meningitis encephalitis panel. CSF cultures were not obtained at that time due to limited sample volume. An infectious diseases specialist was consulted and recommended an empiric antimicrobial regimen with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and liposomal amphotericin B given the risk for invasive fungal disease. The patient did not meet criteria for treatment of acute COVID-19 infection, so steroids and antivirals were deferred.\n\nFig. 1 Head images (CT and MRI). a (Day 2 admission): MRI T1 brain sagittal view showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward through the right gyrus rectus. b (Day 3 admission): sinus CT showed mild opacification of superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive changes of the osseous septa and possible defect. c (Day 4 admission): head CT showed cerebral edema with mass effect suggestive of infectious cerebritis. d (Day 10 admission): MRI Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain coronal view showed significantly increased area of cerebritis/phlegmon involving right frontal lobe extending into the basal ganglia. Interval increased midline shift with extension of vasogenic edema to the left gyrus rectus. e (Day 16 admission): MRI T2 brain horizontal view showed progression of parenchymal involvement involving right frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, and across the corpus callosum to the contralateral side with a 3-mm right-to-left midline shift. f (Day 25 admission, day 15 post ope, 9/29 images): increased mass effect with right-to-left midline shift with interval increased hypodensity involving the right frontotemporal lobes, basal ganglia, and thalamus extending to the right midbrain, representing increased edema or infection.\n\nOn day 3 of admission, sinus CT scan  revealed mild opacification of the superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive change of the osseous septa and possible bone defect. An otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgeon performed an endoscopic nasal examination, notable for friable tissue without evidence of necrosis. Due to limited patient tolerance during the awake examination, biopsies were not obtained at that time. On day 4 of admission, repeat head CT  showed interval progression of intracranial pathology with mass effect and cerebral edema suggestive of infectious cerebritis. Repeat LP was unsuccessful, so blood metagenomics testing (Karius test, Redwood City, CA) was obtained on day 5 to aid in the diagnosis. She continued to have daily fevers despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Blood cultures obtained at initial presentation remained negative, and an evaluation for endocarditis as a potential source of fever was unrevealing. Invasive fungal disease was most concerning among the differential diagnoses, so posaconazole was added to the antimicrobial regimen on day 7 of admission while awaiting results of the Karius test. Results returned on day 9 of admission and revealed genetic material belonging to a fungal organism. The positive Karius test in the setting of progressive intracranial disease confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nVancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole were discontinued, and treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole was continued at that time. Repeat imaging on day 10  showed disease progression with worsening midline shift while on maximal antifungal therapy, prompting the decision to pursue emergent surgical debridement. The patient underwent frontal craniotomy with drainage of abscess and sphenoidotomy with debridement. Intraoperative findings were notable for invasive infection and necrotizing cerebritis . Pathology revealed necrosis with non-septate broad hyphae and scattered giant cells with micro-abscess formation. Posaconazole was discontinued on day 13 due to prolonged QTc interval identified on surveillance electrocardiogram (EKG) and was replaced with isavuconazole. Nasal amphotericin irrigations were performed by ENT as adjunctive therapy.\n\nFig. 2 Endoscopic view of the right nasal cavity.

Microscopic examination of the debridement specimen from right frontal lobe reveals necrotic brain tissue with broad-based ribbon-like pauciseptate hyphae. The angle of branching is wide-angle and greater than other organisms, usually approaching 90\u00b0 (a and b). Angioinvasion is easily identified (c).

Weekly head imaging was performed for disease surveillance and showed progression of disease despite maximal antifungal therapy. On postoperative day 6 (day 16 of admission), brain MRI  showed extension of intracranial infection to the contralateral hemisphere and brainstem involvement. Given these findings, no further neurosurgical intervention was recommended. Progression of the disease continued, and subsequent imaging  showed worsening midline shift (1.5 cm on postoperative day 15) with evidence of early temporal lobe herniation. Hospital course was additionally complicated by nephrotoxicity, aspiration pneumonia, and venous catheter-associated thrombus formation requiring anticoagulation therapy. Nasal amphotericin irrigations were discontinued on hospital day 20 due to severe nosebleeds during the procedure.\n\nSupportive care was offered for the aforementioned complications, and the patient continued maintenance therapy with liposomal amphotericin B and isavuconazole. Dose adjustments were made to the antifungals due to renal impairment. Despite these challenges, her clinical status steadily improved. She was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility on hospital day 79 for ongoing medical management and intensive therapies to maximize functional status. After 104 days total of inpatient management, the patient was discharged home and transitioned to outpatient care. Amphotericin B was discontinued at time of discharge, and she remains on isavuconazole monotherapy. As of 10 months from initial diagnosis, she continues showing improvement in functional domains as she can fully ambulate and perform activities of daily living with minimal assistance.",

Four patients, all Asian female, aged between 26 and 71 years old, with average age of 49.25 \u00b1 18.38 were included in this study. To protect the privacy of the patients, we hid their real names, visiting department, hospitalization number, bed number, and other related information. Cases 1 and 2 were previously healthy, while cases 3 and 4 were accompanied by hypertension and renal insufficiency. There was no obvious abnormality in their family or psychosocial history, including related genetic information. Investigations on admission showed no history of pancreatic/salivary gland-related diseases or trauma, neoplasms, genital tract diseases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) operation history, or abdominal surgery. In addition, patients were not diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, common drug factors (such as amino salicylic acid, thiopurine, and asparaginase), or megaamylasemia that can cause elevated serum amylase levels. Basic information and clinical data of the four patients are presented in .  \n Clinical data  \nFull size table  \nClinical manifestations  \nCase 1 showed persistent upper abdominal pain and right abdominal tenderness, with no episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or rebound pain following high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL. Case 2 had abdominal distension, persistent epigastric pain, with no other concomitant symptoms, either. Meanwhile, cases 3 and 4 did not show any significant symptoms. The positive physical examination results of the four cases were all related to the primary disease, and the abdominal physical examination showed no apparent abnormality.  \nClinical findings  \nAfter high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL, serum amylase (AMY) levels increased in four patients, peaking at 193.1 to 340.4 U/L. In addition, increases in urine amylase and serum lipase were also observed. Abdominal enhanced CT scan performed after the occurrence of elevated serum amylase levels in case 1 showed sand-like stones in the gallbladder, with a normal shape of pancreas. In cases 2, 3, and 4, abdominal ultrasound performed prior to high-dose mPSL indicated gallbladder sediment-like stones, rough gallbladder wall, and gallbladder stones, respectively. Notably, the CT scans in cases 2, 3, and 4 did not reveal any abnormalities of the pancreas. The AMY fluctuations of the four patients over time are shown in Fig. 1.  \nFig. 1  \nAMY fluctuations of the four cases and the corresponding course of disease. The four cases started to use high-dose mPSL on the 3rd day, 6th day, 8th day, and 9th day of the disease course. AMY elevation was noted on the 19th day, 9th day, 14th day, and 13th day, respectively. AMY peak appeared on day 22, day 17, day 18, and day 34, respectively.

Only cases 1 and 2 experienced epigastric pain, while enhancement CT in case 1 revealed gallstones. We were able to identify elevated serum amylase levels on the basis of the fact that the four patients had different elevations of AMY that exceeded the normal reference values of our hospital system. We speculate about the possibility of elevated serum amylase levels caused by high doses of intravenous GC through the adverse drug response evaluation described below. We considered whether this can be attributed to drug-induced pancreatitis, but imaging did not reveal any pancreatic abnormalities and therefore diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis were not met. The overall prognosis of the four patients is good.  \nInterventions and outcomes  \nCase 1 and 2 underwent fasting. Then, they were given omeprazole to inhibit gastric acid, phloroglucinol as antispasmodic, somatostatin to inhibit pancreatic enzyme secretion, and anti-infection and nutritional support treatment. Two patients were discharged after a significant decrease in AMY levels, and case 3 and 4 were discharged after improvement of the primary disease. At outpatient review, they indicated that mPLS was effective for the primary disease and that, despite the unexpected increase in AMY, subsequent active interventions led to normalization of AMY. Unfortunately, they have not been followed since then.",

We considered whether this can be attributed to drug-induced pancreatitis, but imaging did not reveal any pancreatic abnormalities and therefore diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis were not met. The overall prognosis of the four patients is good.  \nInterventions and outcomes  \nCase 1 and 2 underwent fasting. Then, they were given omeprazole to inhibit gastric acid, phloroglucinol as antispasmodic, somatostatin to inhibit pancreatic enzyme secretion, and anti-infection and nutritional support treatment. Two patients were discharged after a significant decrease in AMY levels, and case 3 and 4 were discharged after improvement of the primary disease. At outpatient review, they indicated that mPLS was effective for the primary disease and that, despite the unexpected increase in AMY, subsequent active interventions led to normalization of AMY. Unfortunately, they have not been followed since then.",

The cutaneous nodules had progressed over time and were visible on both legs. The patient had no significant medical history, was a former smoker, used 14 units of alcohol per week, and had done office work. She had not experienced abdominal discomfort or weight loss. Both her parents had died from lung cancer, and there was no further family history of gastrointestinal or pancreatic cancer. She was the mother of three children and used the following medications: allopurinol, metoprolol, omeprazole, perindopril/indapamide, and pravastatin. \n\nPhysical examination revealed three cutaneous nodules ranging in diameter from 1 to 4 cm on both legs . One was slightly red, while the other two were dark red to purple\u2013blue. All were painful during palpation. According to the dermatologist, the skin lesions were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of panniculitis. Further neurological and physical examination was not performed. \n\nFig. 1 Cutaneous nodules on both legs during presentation Full size image \n\nThe skin biopsy obtained showed a predominantly lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis of which the aspect was highly suspicious for pancreatic panniculitis . Based on this finding, further diagnostic analyses were performed including blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scan followed by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and fine-needle biopsy. A lipase serum level of >\u20093000 U/L (normal range <\u200960 U/L) and a mass located between the stomach and the left side of the pancreas, with a diameter of 7.4 cm, was seen . There were no signs of metastases.

Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy including splenectomy was advised. Upon hospital admission, pulse, blood pressure, and temperature were normal. The patient underwent this procedure laparoscopically including en bloc wedge resection of the stomach owing to tumor in-growth. Operation time was 7 h. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 4 after an uncomplicated hospital stay. During the hospital stay, she received paracetamol, oxycodone, pheneticillin because of the splenectomy, and magnesium hydroxide. Her renal and liver function were normal. No additional urinalysis or microbiology was performed. The cutaneous nodules on both legs had disappeared 1\u20132 days after surgery. \n\nThe diagnosis on the resection specimen was made, the resection margins were free of tumor (R0 resection), and there were no lymph node metastases found in 12 examined lymph nodes. The postoperative multidisciplinary team meeting advised the patient to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the added value of adjuvant chemotherapy for this rare form of pancreatic carcinoma has not been well researched. Based on the available data, the patient rejected adjuvant chemotherapy. \n\nDuring the first and second outpatient visit, at 4 and 6 months postoperatively, no long-term complications were reported, and the patient had recovered well. One year after surgery, the patient presented to the emergency room with similar symptoms as preoperatively.

Echocardiography findings were highly suggestive for precapillary pulmonary hypertension: severe right chambers dilation, D-shaped left ventricle, severe tricuspid regurgitation, high velocity of tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary pressure estimated at 100 mmHg, dilated and not collapsing inferior vena cava, and pericardial effusion. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest excluded pulmonary embolism; high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) ruled out parenchymal diseases and mediastinal lymphadenopathy; capillaroscopy documented a scleroderma pattern; antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-centromere antibodies (ACA), and anti-mitochondrial antibodies tested positive; HIV serology tested negative; hepatic echo-Doppler ruled out portopulmonary hypertension. Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was not tested because of severe hypoxemia. Right heart catheterization (RCAT) documented a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 58 mmHg, cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m\u00b2, right atrial pressure (RAP) of 8 mmHg, pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) of 8 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 16 Woods units (WU). Laboratory tests showed a monoclonal spike of IgG-\u03bb. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (34 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (34 U/L) and bilirubin levels (1 mg/dL) tested within normal ranges. N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) tested positive for possible heart failure (4534 ng/L). Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was ruled out as a cause of PAH by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Continuous intravenous treatment with epoprostenol was proposed but refused by the patient, who was therefore treated with a high dose of furosemide before starting a specific oral therapy for PAH. At first, suspecting PVOD, sildenafil 20 mg BID was prescribed and titrated to 20 mg TID over 1 month, without reported adverse effects. After this, macitentan was prescribed at 10 mg OD. After 1 month, a significant increase in AST (485 U/L) and ALT (451 U/L) levels was found on routine analyses. Macitentan therapy was therefore suspended, with a gradual decrease in levels of transaminases. Liver ultrasound and complete viral serology showed no signs of specific diseases. After suspending macitentan administration, the patient\u2019s clinical condition worsened and sildenafil was replaced with tadalafil 20 mg OD, which was then titrated to 40 mg OD. In February 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases, selexipag therapy was introduced with slow titration. After 2 months, at the dose of 800 mcg BID with selexipag, AST and ALT levels were increased (201 and 232 U/L). Selexipag therapy was suspended, and RCAT was performed, resulting in the following: mean PAP of 62 mmHg, CI of 2.6 L/min/m\u00b2, RAP of 6 mmHg, and PVR of 12.7 WU. The implant of a subcutaneous pump for treprostinil infusion was proposed but refused by the patient. In May 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases and after a pharmacogenetics consultation, ambrisentan was prescribed (5 mg/die) in association with tadalafil (40 mg/die). After the last RCAT (PAP 42 mmHg, CI 3.5 l/min/m\u00b2, RAP 6 mmHg, PVR 7.7 UW), the patient started triple therapy, adding inhaled iloprost.

Right heart catheterization (RCAT) documented a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 58 mmHg, cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m\u00b2, right atrial pressure (RAP) of 8 mmHg, pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) of 8 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 16 Woods units (WU). Laboratory tests showed a monoclonal spike of IgG-\u03bb. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (34 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (34 U/L) and bilirubin levels (1 mg/dL) tested within normal ranges. N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) tested positive for possible heart failure (4534 ng/L). Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was ruled out as a cause of PAH by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Continuous intravenous treatment with epoprostenol was proposed but refused by the patient, who was therefore treated with a high dose of furosemide before starting a specific oral therapy for PAH. At first, suspecting PVOD, sildenafil 20 mg BID was prescribed and titrated to 20 mg TID over 1 month, without reported adverse effects. After this, macitentan was prescribed at 10 mg OD. After 1 month, a significant increase in AST (485 U/L) and ALT (451 U/L) levels was found on routine analyses. Macitentan therapy was therefore suspended, with a gradual decrease in levels of transaminases. Liver ultrasound and complete viral serology showed no signs of specific diseases. After suspending macitentan administration, the patient\u2019s clinical condition worsened and sildenafil was replaced with tadalafil 20 mg OD, which was then titrated to 40 mg OD. In February 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases, selexipag therapy was introduced with slow titration. After 2 months, at the dose of 800 mcg BID with selexipag, AST and ALT levels were increased (201 and 232 U/L). Selexipag therapy was suspended, and RCAT was performed, resulting in the following: mean PAP of 62 mmHg, CI of 2.6 L/min/m\u00b2, RAP of 6 mmHg, and PVR of 12.7 WU. The implant of a subcutaneous pump for treprostinil infusion was proposed but refused by the patient. In May 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases and after a pharmacogenetics consultation, ambrisentan was prescribed (5 mg/die) in association with tadalafil (40 mg/die). After the last RCAT (PAP 42 mmHg, CI 3.5 l/min/m\u00b2, RAP 6 mmHg, PVR 7.7 UW), the patient started triple therapy, adding inhaled iloprost. To date, good control of PHA symptoms has been achieved in the patient, without signs of liver injury . Fig. 1 Flowchart of patient treatment. Evaluation of heart failure (by N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide measure) and liver injury (by transaminases plasma levels measure) risk related to pharmacological treatment.

Delivery was completed at the Gynecological center at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo, with a birth weight (BW) of 3600 g. Cholecalciferol (D3) for prevention of vitamin D deficiency was administered regularly. She was vaccinated regularly as per national vaccination calendar. She was breastfed for 1 year and a half, and supplementary food was introduced at 6 months of life. Her growth and development were normal. No relevant family history was reported. She was diagnosed with epilepsy 4 years ago. She initially presented with generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, and antiepileptic therapy, valproic acid, was initiated by pediatric neurologist. Despite treatment and compliance with therapy, seizures continued; therefore, a second antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, was introduced, and she continued to be on both antiepileptic drugs and comply with therapy. However, recently, she started to manifest hallucinations, emotional disturbances, and irritability, and the psychiatrist put her on fluoxetine. Later, she experienced cognitive decline, behavioral change, dysarthria, and difficulty walking. At admission, she weighed 40 kg and was disoriented, irritable, and unable to communicate. Physical examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed no erythema or swelling, but difficulty walking independently. Other system examination revealed no pathologic findings. Overall, the results of routine blood tests showed normal values; hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count was 156,000/mm3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein was negative. Furthermore, liver enzymes, urea, and creatinine, as well as acid\u2013base status of the blood, were within normal values. Other investigations, including urinalysis, were negative, too. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses excluded infectious and immune-mediated etiology. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed, and the psychiatrist was consulted. Owing to progressive neurological status deterioration and lack of response to therapy, it was decided to send the child to a more advanced center abroad for genetic testing because of the inability to perform genetic testing in the country. At the same time, axillary skin biopsy was performed and inclusion bodies were detected. The results of genetic testing also confirmed the diagnosis by detecting a mutation on the NHLRC1 gene. Therefore, parental testing to confirm their carrier status was recommended, as well as genetic counseling. By the time the diagnosis was confirmed, the child had almost lost the ability to walk and speak. She could walk with great difficulty with the help of both parents on each side (the rest of the time via wheelchair) and could articulate a few sentences with difficulty. She still remains in this condition (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).",

Her past medical history was unremarkable and she neither smoked nor drank alcohol, nor she did not take any medication except intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF in her left eye 2 years previously. At presentation, her vital signs were stable (pulse rate 80 beats/minute, blood pressure: 115/60 mmHg, temperature: 36.9 \u00b0C), and baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 3/10 in both eyes. Anterior segment examination using slit-lamp biomicroscopy was unremarkable, and intraocular pressure was within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed parafoveal telangiectatic vessels with capillary dilatation, as well as barely visible sclerotic vessels temporal to the macula, in both eyes. There was also dense circinate exudation and edema in the macula of the right eye. In the left eye, irregular perifoveal graying discoloration was evident . Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula in the right eye demonstrated aneurysms of various sizes located within inner retinal layers as well as exudation and retinal thickening. Retina in the macular area of the left eye was atrophic with disorganization of retina inner layers (DRIL). Of note, despite extensive capillary dropout, the architecture of the photoreceptors remained intact (Fig. 2a, c).\n\nFig. 1 Color fundus photographs of the right (a) and left (b) eye demonstrate parafoveal telangiectatic vessels and round red lesions representing microaneurysms as well as occluded sclerotic vessels (black arrows) in both eyes. Macular edema and circinate exudation are evident in the right eye (a) Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Macula OCT of the right eye (a) shows various-sized aneurysms within inner retinal layers, exudation, and retinal thickening in the form of CME. Macula OCT of the left eye (c) shows an atrophic thin retina with poorly defined layers. En face 3 \u00d7 3 mm OCTA in b and d demonstrates aneurysms and telangiectatic capillaries in deep and superficial capillary plexuses with sparse and distorted vessels in superficial plexus (left frames in b, d) and diffuse vascular rarefaction and dropout, telangiectatic vessels, and FAZ enlargement in deep capillary plexus (right frames in b, d), more prominent in the right eye (b). \n\nThe 3 \u00d7 3 mm en face OCT angiography (OCTA) visualized aneurysms and telangiectasia in capillaries of deep and superficial capillary plexuses of the retina. In addition, vessels in the superficial plexus were sparse, distorted, and elongated with decreased density. More affected, deep capillary plexus showed diffuse rarefaction, telangiectasia, blunting of capillaries, and enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and perifoveal capillary loss, which were more prominent in the right eye (Fig. 2b, d).\n\nRight eye fundus autofluorescence imaging showed florid-like hyper-autofluorescence, suggesting CME (Fig. 3a, d). Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed dilated capillary bed in the parafoveal area, bordering capillary-free zone in both eyes. Also, pooling in the aneurysms and late intraretinal staining in the region of telangiectasia occurred, being more prominent in the right eye. The FAZ was enlarged and regions of capillary dropout were observed in the perifoveal area of both eyes (Fig. 3b, c, e, f).\n\nFig. 3 Fundus autofluorescence of right (a) and left (d) eye demonstrate florid-like hyper-autofluorescence in the right eye (a), suggesting CME. Fluorescein angiography of the right (b, c) and left (e, f) eye visualized numerous aneurysms that pool fluorescein, telangiectasia in the parafoveal area, enlarged FAZ, as well as small area with perifoveal capillary dropout, more prominent in the right eye (b, c) Full size image\n\nWe requested a neurological consultation for our patient to search for neurological impairment such as stroke, vasculitis, or white matter lesion. The result was as follows: The patient is alert and oriented with normal speech. Sensory or motor deficit is absent. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are brisk, 2+, and symmetric in limbs. Babinski reflex is negative, and examination cranial nerves reveals them to be intact. Cerebellar tests such as finger to nose and heel to shin is smooth without dysmetria. Coordination is intact measured by walk toe\u2013heel. Gait is steady with normal base. According to the possible chances of associated neurological deficits, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered and came back as unremarkable.\n\nExtensive systemic workup was also undertaken to search for an underlying etiology. Laboratory investigations including coagulation tests, blood chemistries, renal and liver function tests, urinalysis, and microbiologic studies showed no abnormalities. The results are as follows: Complete blood count: RBC: 5.22 (\u00d7 10^6/microL), Hct: 38.2%, HGB: 12.2 g/dL, WBC: 7.8 (\u00d7 10^3/microL), Plt: 290 (\u00d7 10^3/microL); liver function test: SGPT: 21 (U/L), SGOT: 30 (U/L) ALP: 300 (U/L); renal function test: BUN: 8 mg/dL Cr: 0.95 mg/dL; urinalysis: color: yellow, clear with negative protein, ketone, bilirubin and nitrates, pH: 6.0, specific gravity: 1.015; FBS: 78 mg/dL. Serology testing result was as follows: TB (IGRA), Toxoplasma IgG and IgM (0.1 CLIA), HIV, VDRL, RPR as well as FTA-ABS, and CRP were all negative. Anti dsDNA (10 IU/ml), ANA, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) and p-ANCA, lupus anticoagulant (0.95) and anticardiolipin (0.1 AEU), and serum complement (95 mg/dL) were all negative. Serum protein electrophoresis, serum cryoglobulin (115 mg/dL) was within normal range. ESR (30 mm/hr), Ca: 9.6 mg/dL, P: 4.1 mg/dL, PT: 13 seconds and PTT: 31 seconds were all unremarkable.\n\nWe suggested an anti-VEGF injection in her right eye with macular edema. The left eye with atrophic retina remained untreated. Injection of intravitreal bevacizumab was not effective for the right eye, with no improvement.

    "rewritten_case": "A 58-year-old Iranian woman presented with gradual decline in vision in both eyes since adolescence that had worsened recently. Her past medical history was unremarkable and she neither smoked nor drank alcohol, nor she did not take any medication except intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF in her left eye 2 years previously. At presentation, her vital signs were stable (pulse rate 80 beats/minute, blood pressure: 115/60 mmHg, temperature: 36.9 \u00b0C), and baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 3/10 in both eyes. Anterior segment examination using slit-lamp biomicroscopy was unremarkable, and intraocular pressure was within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed parafoveal telangiectatic vessels with capillary dilatation, as well as barely visible sclerotic vessels temporal to the macula, in both eyes. There was also dense circinate exudation and edema in the macula of the right eye. In the left eye, irregular perifoveal graying discoloration was evident . Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula in the right eye demonstrated aneurysms of various sizes located within inner retinal layers as well as exudation and retinal thickening. Retina in the macular area of the left eye was atrophic with disorganization of retina inner layers (DRIL). Of note, despite extensive capillary dropout, the architecture of the photoreceptors remained intact (Fig. 2a, c).\n\nFig. 1 Color fundus photographs of the right (a) and left (b) eye demonstrate parafoveal telangiectatic vessels and round red lesions representing microaneurysms as well as occluded sclerotic vessels (black arrows) in both eyes. Macular edema and circinate exudation are evident in the right eye (a) Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Macula OCT of the right eye (a) shows various-sized aneurysms within inner retinal layers, exudation, and retinal thickening in the form of CME. Macula OCT of the left eye (c) shows an atrophic thin retina with poorly defined layers. En face 3 \u00d7 3 mm OCTA in b and d demonstrates aneurysms and telangiectatic capillaries in deep and superficial capillary plexuses with sparse and distorted vessels in superficial plexus (left frames in b, d) and diffuse vascular rarefaction and dropout, telangiectatic vessels, and FAZ enlargement in deep capillary plexus (right frames in b, d), more prominent in the right eye (b). \n\nThe 3 \u00d7 3 mm en face OCT angiography (OCTA) visualized aneurysms and telangiectasia in capillaries of deep and superficial capillary plexuses of the retina. In addition, vessels in the superficial plexus were sparse, distorted, and elongated with decreased density. More affected, deep capillary plexus showed diffuse rarefaction, telangiectasia, blunting of capillaries, and enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and perifoveal capillary loss, which were more prominent in the right eye (Fig. 2b, d).\n\nRight eye fundus autofluorescence imaging showed florid-like hyper-autofluorescence, suggesting CME (Fig. 3a, d). Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed dilated capillary bed in the parafoveal area, bordering capillary-free zone in both eyes. Also, pooling in the aneurysms and late intraretinal staining in the region of telangiectasia occurred, being more prominent in the right eye. The FAZ was enlarged and regions of capillary dropout were observed in the perifoveal area of both eyes (Fig. 3b, c, e, f).\n\nFig. 3 Fundus autofluorescence of right (a) and left (d) eye demonstrate florid-like hyper-autofluorescence in the right eye (a), suggesting CME. Fluorescein angiography of the right (b, c) and left (e, f) eye visualized numerous aneurysms that pool fluorescein, telangiectasia in the parafoveal area, enlarged FAZ, as well as small area with perifoveal capillary dropout, more prominent in the right eye (b, c) Full size image\n\nWe requested a neurological consultation for our patient to search for neurological impairment such as stroke, vasculitis, or white matter lesion. The result was as follows: The patient is alert and oriented with normal speech. Sensory or motor deficit is absent. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are brisk, 2+, and symmetric in limbs. Babinski reflex is negative, and examination cranial nerves reveals them to be intact. Cerebellar tests such as finger to nose and heel to shin is smooth without dysmetria. Coordination is intact measured by walk toe\u2013heel. Gait is steady with normal base. According to the possible chances of associated neurological deficits, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered and came back as unremarkable.\n\nExtensive systemic workup was also undertaken to search for an underlying etiology. Laboratory investigations including coagulation tests, blood chemistries, renal and liver function tests, urinalysis, and microbiologic studies showed no abnormalities. The results are as follows: Complete blood count: RBC: 5.22 (\u00d7 10^6/microL), Hct: 38.2%, HGB: 12.2 g/dL, WBC: 7.8 (\u00d7 10^3/microL), Plt: 290 (\u00d7 10^3/microL); liver function test: SGPT: 21 (U/L), SGOT: 30 (U/L) ALP: 300 (U/L); renal function test: BUN: 8 mg/dL Cr: 0.95 mg/dL; urinalysis: color: yellow, clear with negative protein, ketone, bilirubin and nitrates, pH: 6.0, specific gravity: 1.015; FBS: 78 mg/dL. Serology testing result was as follows: TB (IGRA), Toxoplasma IgG and IgM (0.1 CLIA), HIV, VDRL, RPR as well as FTA-ABS, and CRP were all negative. Anti dsDNA (10 IU/ml), ANA, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) and p-ANCA, lupus anticoagulant (0.95) and anticardiolipin (0.1 AEU), and serum complement (95 mg/dL) were all negative.

He denied any allergies, history of sexually transmitted infections, smoking, and drinking, and had had no surgeries in the past. He had been administered broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone 2 g) intravenously following the suture, with no improvement. Untreated, such symptoms rapidly destroy the gliding mechanism, causing adhesion formation and giving rise to necrosis.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed shift of the descending and sigmoid colon toward the right side with dilation , but there were no significant findings suggestive of the reason for acute abdominal pain. The patient revisited hospital the next day with continuous lower abdominal pain and bloody stool. Vital signs were oxygen saturation 97% under room air, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, pulse 106 beats/minute, blood pressure 173/97 mmHg, and body temperature 37.6 \u00b0C.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a multilocular cyst tumor, with solid components and a diameter of 6 cm, in the left ovary, and small-volume ascites. The tumor showed heterogeneity on the T2-weighted image and mostly low signal, but some high signal, which was not fat suppressed in T1-weighted images after fat suppression . Computed tomography (CT) showed no distant metastasis and no obvious abnormal accumulation in the thyroid gland. The patient\u2019s preoperative serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) was elevated to 84.9 U/ml (normal range <35.0), whereas the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC) were within their respective normal ranges.\n\nFig. 1 Magnetic resonance imaging findings.

C In T1 fat-suppressed and contrast imaging, the tumor showed heterogeneous staining in the low-signal part in T1-weighted image.\n\nTotal abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and omentectomy were performed without any residual tumor because the intraoperative rapid histological diagnosis of the left ovarian tumor was suspicious for low-grade malignancy. The postoperative course, as well, was uneventful. Upon gross examination of the surgically resected specimen, the left ovary was whitish with tough elasticity, and the split surface was composed of polycystic formations with a solid area. Histologically, there were two patterns of histological subtypes: papillary carcinoma and poorly differentiated carcinoma . About 70% of the tumor was composed of follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland growing in a papillary fashion, while about 30% of the tumor had poorly differentiated carcinoma. In the area of the papillary carcinoma, the nuclei of the tumor cells were like \u201cground glass\u201d with coffee bean-like grooves . In the other area, full, nodular, and insular structures were observed, and nuclear fission images were confirmed . The immunohistochemical analysis showed that both components were positive for thyroglobulin; the Ki-67 (MIB-1) index was 5% in the papillary carcinoma and 35% in the poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\nFig. 2 Histological image of the ovary.

C In T1 fat-suppressed and contrast imaging, the tumor showed heterogeneous staining in the low-signal part in T1-weighted image.\n\nTotal abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and omentectomy were performed without any residual tumor because the intraoperative rapid histological diagnosis of the left ovarian tumor was suspicious for low-grade malignancy. The postoperative course, as well, was uneventful. Upon gross examination of the surgically resected specimen, the left ovary was whitish with tough elasticity, and the split surface was composed of polycystic formations with a solid area. Histologically, there were two patterns of histological subtypes: papillary carcinoma and poorly differentiated carcinoma . About 70% of the tumor was composed of follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland growing in a papillary fashion, while about 30% of the tumor had poorly differentiated carcinoma. In the area of the papillary carcinoma, the nuclei of the tumor cells were like \u201cground glass\u201d with coffee bean-like grooves . In the other area, full, nodular, and insular structures were observed, and nuclear fission images were confirmed . The immunohistochemical analysis showed that both components were positive for thyroglobulin; the Ki-67 (MIB-1) index was 5% in the papillary carcinoma and 35% in the poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\nFig. 2 Histological image of the ovary. A Papillary thyroid carcinoma on the upper right corner of the screen shows papillary growth. The lower left of the screen shows poorly differentiated carcinoma. Chordal arrangement, insular arrangement, and solid patterns are seen (HE: \u00d740). B In the part of papillary thyroid carcinoma, high-resolution image depicting the cells comprising the papillary architecture of the tumor. The nuclei of the tumor cells are large, and the nuclear fission image is inconspicuous. Ground-glass nuclei (black arrows) and coffee-bean like nuclear grooves (green arrows) are seen.

The patient had no classical risk factors for the development of opportunistic infection, prominent history of trauma, cosmetic lip tattoo, or burning in her lips. She had taken corticosteroid nasal spray for bronchitis. The clinical examination revealed an ill-demarcated, kissing ulcer associated thick, crusted area with a size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 cm on her lower lip. The ulcer was tender and discharged when pressed . There were no symptoms of interdigital intertrigo involvement nor signs of onychomycosis. The patient was not febrile, and there was no regional lymphadenopathy. The oral mucosa and tongue tissues were normal. Systemic general examinations were not noticeable. The results of screening for human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab), hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) were negative. At the onset of symptoms, she complained of dysphagia; however, she had typical results for endoscopic evaluation.

Her father had a history of ESRD of unknown etiology and died from a myocardial infarction in his forties. She worked at T Mobile as a salesperson. She had not traveled outside of Illinois, which is where she was born and had lived her whole life. She denied alcohol or tobacco use and her only medication was loratadine as needed for allergic rhinitis. She underwent a renal biopsy and nine out of the twenty sampled glomeruli featured segmental or global scarring. In the non-globally sclerotic glomeruli, the glomerular tufts showed marked visceral epithelial cell proliferation and the glomerulus showed global collapse. Diffuse foot process effacement was present on electron micrography . Work-up for secondary causes was negative. She received oral prednisone and cyclosporine for about 2 years (dose unknown), achieved partial remission (defined as a reduction in proteinuria by 50% or more and stable renal function), and was maintained on oral losartan 100 mg daily.\n\n Patient characteristics at various timepoints of disease course\nFull size table\nFig. 1 a A silver stain showing parietal epithelial cell proliferation and collapse of the glomerular tuft. b An electron micrograph showing diffuse foot process effacement Full size image\n\nAt the age of 27, she presented to the hospital with several weeks of fever, sore throat, chest pain, and body aches. Outpatient testing for influenza, streptococcus, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus was negative. On admission, her temperature was 104.4 F, blood pressure 117/76 mmHg, and heart rate 114 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed a cooperative female in no acute distress, normal conjunctiva, unremarkable oropharynx without pharyngeal erythema, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, sinus tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs, clear lung fields, benign abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, diffuse joint tenderness but no joint swelling, no rash, normal gait, and intact cranial nerves, motor strength, sensation, and reflexes. Laboratory examination was significant for leukocytosis, acute on chronic kidney disease, nephrotic range proteinuria, and mild transaminitis. Serologies showed antinuclear antibodies (ANA) of 1:80, negative dsDNA, normal complement levels, rheumatoid factor (RF) of 60 IU/mL, negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type A (SSA) > 8, and negative anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type B (SSB). Ferritin was > 40,000 ng/mL (). Electrocardiogram (EKG) was noted to have diffuse ST segment elevations , troponin was 2 ng/mL, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild pericardial effusion ; this constellation was consistent with pericarditis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, pelvis (CAP) showed a small left sided pleural effusion . CT of the neck showed enlarged bilateral lymph nodes without evidence of abscess.\n\nFig. 2 Electrocardiogram with diffuse PR segment depression and ST segment elevation consistent with pericarditis Full size image\nFig.3 Transthoracic echocardiogram with mild pericardial effusion Full size image\nFig. 4 Computed tomography chest, abdomen, pelvis with small pleural effusion and atelectasis at left lung base Full size image\n\nAfter no underlying infectious or malignancy causes were identified, a primary rheumatological process was considered. She was given a trial of oral prednisone (60 mg daily), with resolution of fever and leukocytosis and symptomatic improvement. Oral colchicine (0.6 mg daily for 1 month) was added to treat the pericarditis. Repeat renal biopsy re-demonstrated the previous findings and, specifically, absence of SLE features. Her rheumatological presentation was felt to be most consistent with AoSD, given the fevers, arthralgias, leukocytosis, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, elevations in aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT), and the markedly elevated ferritin. Although she had a positive RF, her clinical presentation was not compatible with rheumatoid arthritis. Given her low titer ANA and positive SSA, the possibility of SLE was considered. She was maintained on oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily) and monitored closely in the rheumatology clinic, but over years of follow-up her presentation remained more consistent with AoSD rather than SLE. Additionally, she lacked signs or symptoms to suggest a diagnosis of Sjogren\u2019s disease.\n\nDuring follow-up in the rheumatology clinic, attempts to wean oral prednisone below 10 mg daily were unsuccessful, resulting in flares characterized by fevers, sore throat, facial swelling, arthralgias, myalgias, urticarial rash, flank pain, chest pain, and associated elevated inflammatory markers. Oral methotrexate (15 mg weekly) was added in August 2018 as a steroid sparing agent, with initial improvement. Due to a recurrence of pericardial effusion and inability to increase her methotrexate dose due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 4 weeks) was added in December 2018. Given continued disease activity, the patient was switched to subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg daily) in January 2020 and methotrexate and tocilizumab were discontinued. During this time, her condition remained stable on oral losartan (100 mg daily).\n\nHer rheumatologic disease was quiescent for several months on anakinra, but then the patient developed fever and dry cough requiring admission in March 2020. Infectious work up was negative. Laboratory work-up was concerning for flare of her AoSD although she lacked her usual symptoms of joint pain, sore throat, chest pain, and rashes (). She improved with an increased dose of oral prednisone to 30 mg daily. Shortly after that admission, she developed acute on chronic kidney injury with nephrotic range proteinuria and progression to ESRD. Her anakinra dose was reduced to every other day dosing to account for her ESRD.\n\nShe was admitted to the hospital in September 2020 for fever, malaise, headache, dyspnea, cough, and diarrhea. On presentation, her temperature was 101.4 F, blood pressure 97/55 mmHg, and heart rate 119 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing female, normal conjunctiva, unremarkable oropharynx without pharyngeal erythema, sinus tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs, clear lung fields, benign abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, unremarkable joint examination without evidence of synovitis, malar rash, chest hyperpigmentation, intact cranial nerves, left arm weakness, intact sensation, and intact reflexes. Anakinra was held due to her fevers and ongoing infectious work-up. Laboratory work-up was significant for leukocytosis, worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, and CK 4000 U/L (). CT CAP showed new splenomegaly as well as lymphadenopathy. The patient rapidly deteriorated, resulting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and death within a few days of admission. There was concern that she may have progressed to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (new cytopenia, splenomegaly, high-grade fevers, profoundly elevated ferritin) but additional supportive laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy were not obtained. Autopsy revealed bilateral lung consolidation with red hepatization of all five lobes, green\u2013black mucosal discoloration around the gastric fundus, and hepatosplenomegaly with liver weight of 211 g (expected 1500\u20131800 g) and spleen weight of 414 g (expected 125\u2013195 g).

    "original_case": "We report the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian man who was reported to be an active smoker. His oncological history included immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as a paraneoplastic syndrome with 7000 platelets/mcL, associated with a 4.6-cm lung carcinoma as an incidental diagnosis. Diagnostic testing was performed, ruling out syphilis, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, without gamma alteration in serum protein electrophoresis or any blood smear findings. No further autoantibody tests were performed. Corticosteroids were administered during 1 week at 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone doses together with intravenous immunoglobulins during 5 days, with complete resolution of ITP.\n\nAfter surgery, stage IIB (pT2aN1), moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed. Surgical margins were affected, thus treatment was completed with concurrent weekly docetaxel with radiotherapy with good tolerance. Six months after initial presentation, early progression was evidenced with pleural thickening and pleural effusion. The pathological study was completed with no targeted mutations found and with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) <1% in tumor cells and 25% in stroma cells by 22C3 immunohistochemistry assay. First-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel was started, with partial response after receiving six cycles. Eighteen months after finishing first-line chemotherapy, with maintained response, new pleural progression was evidenced, as confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan. It was thus decided to start a second line with atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody).\n\nTwo weeks after receiving immunotherapy, he presented to the emergency room with severe dyspnea accompanied by intense asthenia, myalgia, and fever of 39 \u00b0C. He denied contact with people suffering coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) infection. Upon presentation, he was conscious and alert with all neurological functions preserved, hemodynamically stable, tachypneic, with 93% oxygen saturation in room air. He looked pale and had bruises on both arms on physical examination. Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly stood out, and auscultation revealed an abolition of left lung sounds. A blood test confirmed moderate pancytopenia, glomerular filtration rate of 50 ml/minute (previously normal), an increase in acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein and ferritin), and elevated levels of D-dimer >20 times normal value (). A computerized angiotomography was performed with no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, neither lung infiltrates nor pleural effusion.\n\nDuring the next 24 hours, he started vomiting with an altered level of consciousness with drowsiness. He had miotic pupils, without other signs of neurological dysfunction. On examination, he had developed progressive jaundice with abdominal pain in the right flank. A few hours later, he suffered a tonic\u2013clonic seizure. Initially, COVID-19 was rejected, and blood tests were repeated at 24 hours, revealing pancytopenia, hyperbilirrubinemia, and hypertransaminitis. Head computed tomography (CT) was performed with no alterations, and a blood smear showed anisocytosis with some elliptocytes. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated due to neurological deterioration with a score of 8 on the Glasgow scale. After assessing the risks and benefits, no lumbar puncture was done. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started, but the possibility that it was a hemophagocytic syndrome was raised and a differential diagnosis was started. Serologies were negative for HSV1-2, CMV, EBV, HIV, HBV, HCV, and HLTV-1 viruses. Elevated IL-6 (19.4 pg/mL) and CD25 (6516 U/m) were found with normal angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. He had 110 CD4 and 620 CD8 lymphocytes with very low CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.18. H-score for hemophagocytic syndrome was 256 points (> 99% probability). Given the high suspicion, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was initiated using 20 mg dexamethasone bolus as 1 mg/kg equivalent of methylprednisolone since day 1.

    "rewritten_case": "We report the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian man who was reported to be an active smoker. His oncological history included immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as a paraneoplastic syndrome with 7000 platelets/mcL, associated with a 4.6-cm lung carcinoma as an incidental diagnosis. Diagnostic testing was performed, ruling out syphilis, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, without gamma alteration in serum protein electrophoresis or any blood smear findings. No further autoantibody tests were performed. Corticosteroids were administered during 1 week at 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone doses together with intravenous immunoglobulins during 5 days, with complete resolution of ITP.\n\nAfter surgery, stage IIB (pT2aN1), moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed. Surgical margins were affected, thus treatment was completed with concurrent weekly docetaxel with radiotherapy with good tolerance. Six months after initial presentation, early progression was evidenced with pleural thickening and pleural effusion. The pathological study was completed with no targeted mutations found and with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) <1% in tumor cells and 25% in stroma cells by 22C3 immunohistochemistry assay. First-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel was started, with partial response after receiving six cycles. Eighteen months after finishing first-line chemotherapy, with maintained response, new pleural progression was evidenced, as confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan. It was thus decided to start a second line with atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody).\n\nTwo weeks after receiving immunotherapy, he presented to the emergency room with severe dyspnea accompanied by intense asthenia, myalgia, and fever of 39 \u00b0C. He denied contact with people suffering coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) infection. Upon presentation, he was conscious and alert with all neurological functions preserved, hemodynamically stable, tachypneic, with 93% oxygen saturation in room air. He looked pale and had bruises on both arms on physical examination. Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly stood out, and auscultation revealed an abolition of left lung sounds. A blood test confirmed moderate pancytopenia, glomerular filtration rate of 50 ml/minute (previously normal), an increase in acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein and ferritin), and elevated levels of D-dimer >20 times normal value (). A computerized angiotomography was performed with no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, neither lung infiltrates nor pleural effusion.\n\nDuring the next 24 hours, he started vomiting with an altered level of consciousness with drowsiness. He had miotic pupils, without other signs of neurological dysfunction. On examination, he had developed progressive jaundice with abdominal pain in the right flank. A few hours later, he suffered a tonic\u2013clonic seizure. Initially, COVID-19 was rejected, and blood tests were repeated at 24 hours, revealing pancytopenia, hyperbilirrubinemia, and hypertransaminitis. Head computed tomography (CT) was performed with no alterations, and a blood smear showed anisocytosis with some elliptocytes. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated due to neurological deterioration with a score of 8 on the Glasgow scale. After assessing the risks and benefits, no lumbar puncture was done. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started, but the possibility that it was a hemophagocytic syndrome was raised and a differential diagnosis was started. Serologies were negative for HSV1-2, CMV, EBV, HIV, HBV, HCV, and HLTV-1 viruses. Elevated IL-6 (19.4 pg/mL) and CD25 (6516 U/m) were found with normal angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. He had 110 CD4 and 620 CD8 lymphocytes with very low CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.18. H-score for hemophagocytic syndrome was 256 points (> 99% probability). Given the high suspicion, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was initiated using 20 mg dexamethasone bolus as 1 mg/kg equivalent of methylprednisolone since day 1. Finally, bone marrow biopsy was performed, showing reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis, and dysplastic signs in megakaryocytic and erythroid reactive lines.\n\nFig. 1 A Bone marrow biopsy with reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis (red arrow), and dysplastic signs in megakaryocytic and erythroid reactive lines.

    "original_case": "A 28-year-old Caucasian man with history of testicular cancer in remission presented with altered mental status, syncope, vertical gaze palsy, ataxia, and tremor. He was in his usual state of health until 2 years ago, when he noticed a large right testicular mass. Work-up revealed marginally enlarged intraabdominal lymph nodes without evidence of metastases. One and a half years ago, he underwent radical unilateral orchiectomy. Pathology revealed malignant mixed germ cell tumor with abundant necrosis, comprising 50% teratoma, 45% embryonal carcinoma, and 5% yolk sac tumor. The mixed germ cell tumor was limited to the testicle without evidence of invasion. Lymph nodes were not examined pathologically. Alpha fetal protein (AFP) was mildly elevated at 9 ng/mL (reference range: 0\u20136.7 ng/mL) and normalized postoperatively. The patient opted for surveillance instead of chemotherapy after consultation with an oncologist. Three months prior to admission, the patient started experiencing fatigue and weight gain of 18 kg over 2 months. He was diagnosed with hypogonadism based on a low testosterone level of 127 ng/dL and started testosterone supplementation. Three weeks prior to admission, he began experiencing difficulty with upward and downward gaze. His fatigue continued to worsen, and he stopped working. One week prior to admission, he developed confusion, which manifested in difficulty remembering his dogs\u2019 names and asking questions in strangely worded ways. He also developed bilateral tremor and ataxia, causing him to fall on a daily basis. The worsening of these neurological symptoms led him to present to the emergency department. While hospitalized, he had an episode of syncope. As this was being evaluated, he was noted to have hypovolemia due to polyuria, which was concerning for diabetes insipidus and, consequently, hypothalamic involvement of his underlying disease. Ultimately, the patient did not meet criteria for diabetes insipidus but did have elevated prolactin of 52.0 ng/mL, concerning for some hypothalamic injury. Due to suspicion that his condition could extend to the pituitary, the patient underwent testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The decreased levels of the above hormones revealed probable panhypopituitarism, with TSH of 0.11 mcIU/mL, free T4 of 1.0 ng/dL, ACTH of <2 pg/mL, LH of 0.5 pg/mL, and FSH of 1.3 mIU/mL. Of note, he was placed on high-dose steroids immediately and has consistently been on these higher-dose steroids, so he has been unable to undergo a cosyntropin test to confirm central adrenal insufficiency. He also underwent a neurologic work-up, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI imaging of the pituitary, which showed T2 prolongation involving the bilateral mesial temporal lobes, hippocampi/fornices, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies and mammillothalamic tracts, and midbrain including periaqueductal gray with normal pituitary (Figs. 1 and 2). His presentation was concerning for encephalitis involving subcortical white matter, deep brain structures, and dorsal midbrain. A lumbar puncture showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and was positive for oligoclonal bands. A broad infectious work-up was otherwise negative. He received high-dose steroids, five sessions of plasmapheresis, and 5 days of intravenous immunoglobulin, without significant improvement in his physical examination or mental status. Repeat ultrasound of the testes, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans, and AFP levels were all normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer. He was discharged with close follow-up.

Unfortunately, the patient did not make significant improvement after his hospitalization, losing the ability to walk and to clear his nasopharyngeal secretions. A few months later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) for progression of his condition, which was complicated by thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, sepsis, and worsening neurological status. During this hospitalization, the patient underwent tracheostomy and placement of a gastric tube. Repeat brain MRI showed similar areas of signal abnormality from prior brain MRI but with mildly decreased intensity . Repeat PET/CT scans and ultrasound of the testes were once again normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer or metastases. However, the patient was initiated on cyclophosphamide and lacosamide. Upon discharge, the patient continued with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, lacosamide, and levetiracetam. Now, 8 months after his initial hospitalization, the patient is closely followed by neurology and endocrinology and remains disoriented with fluctuating levels of alertness.

Due to suspicion that his condition could extend to the pituitary, the patient underwent testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The decreased levels of the above hormones revealed probable panhypopituitarism, with TSH of 0.11 mcIU/mL, free T4 of 1.0 ng/dL, ACTH of <2 pg/mL, LH of 0.5 pg/mL, and FSH of 1.3 mIU/mL. Of note, he was placed on high-dose steroids immediately and has consistently been on these higher-dose steroids, so he has been unable to undergo a cosyntropin test to confirm central adrenal insufficiency. He also underwent a neurologic work-up, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI imaging of the pituitary, which showed T2 prolongation involving the bilateral mesial temporal lobes, hippocampi/fornices, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies and mammillothalamic tracts, and midbrain including periaqueductal gray with normal pituitary (Figs. 1 and 2). His presentation was concerning for encephalitis involving subcortical white matter, deep brain structures, and dorsal midbrain. A lumbar puncture showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and was positive for oligoclonal bands. A broad infectious work-up was otherwise negative. He received high-dose steroids, five sessions of plasmapheresis, and 5 days of intravenous immunoglobulin, without significant improvement in his physical examination or mental status. Repeat ultrasound of the testes, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans, and AFP levels were all normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer. He was discharged with close follow-up.

Sella turcica and pituitary gland are normal in size Full size image After discharge, the patient was treated with rituximab. Unfortunately, the patient did not make significant improvement after his hospitalization, losing the ability to walk and to clear his nasopharyngeal secretions. A few months later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) for progression of his condition, which was complicated by thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, sepsis, and worsening neurological status. During this hospitalization, the patient underwent tracheostomy and placement of a gastric tube. Repeat brain MRI showed similar areas of signal abnormality from prior brain MRI but with mildly decreased intensity . Repeat PET/CT scans and ultrasound of the testes were once again normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer or metastases. However, the patient was initiated on cyclophosphamide and lacosamide. Upon discharge, the patient continued with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, lacosamide, and levetiracetam. Now, 8 months after his initial hospitalization, the patient is closely followed by neurology and endocrinology and remains disoriented with fluctuating levels of alertness.

He was followed in the cardiology clinic again at 1 month of age. At that time, an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a sinus tachycardia of 200 beats per minute and hypertension. An echocardiogram was significant for left ventricular hypertrophy with septal wall thickness in diastole of 7 mm and a posterior wall measurement of 5 mm consistent with left ventricular noncompaction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype. He was also noted to have different skin tones and pigmentation from trunk to lower extremities. He was started on a beta-blocker with plans to follow up in clinic in 2 months and was referred to dermatology for evaluation of the skin lesions.  \nAt 6 weeks of age, he presented to the cardiomyopathy clinic owing to left ventricular hypertrophy and was also having difficulty feeding.

He was retired from working in corporate management, and family history was significant for lung cancer in his father and breast cancer in a sister. Comorbid illnesses included gastrointestinal reflux disease, for which he took ranitidine 150 mg daily and omeprazole 20 mg daily; hypertension, for which he took lisinopril 12.5 mg daily; hyperlipidemia, for which he took atorvastatin 20 mg daily; and seasonal allergies and asthma, for which he took montelukast 150 mg daily and loratadine 10 mg daily. He was also using naproxen and cannabis for cancer-related pain at time of presentation. He was a lifelong non-smoker and did not drink alcohol to excess. He first noticed his right neck mass while shaving 3 months prior to presentation. He reported some mild pain with swallowing, weight loss of unknown amount, right neck sensitivity to light touch, increased hoarseness, and a raspy voice. He was initially diagnosed by his primary care physician as having lymphadenopathy secondary to a sinus infection and received two rounds of antibiotics. The mass failed to improve and, as a result, a fine needle aspiration of the lesion was performed. Evaluation of the biopsy material demonstrated dysmorphic cells containing cytoplasmic keratin, which stained positively for CK5/6, consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma. Monoclonal PAX-8 (Biocare Medical, BC12) staining was also focally positive . Subsequent laryngoscopy revealed no mucosal lesions, but right vocal cord paralysis was observed. A CT of the neck with contrast revealed a 4.8 cm peripherally enhancing hypodense mass with central necrosis lateral to the right hyoid bone, emanating from the thyroid gland . Multiple smaller nodular lesions within the prevertebral space, right paraesophageal region, and superior mediastinum were also identified. A staging PET scan showed a hypermetabolic right thyroid lobe with extensive conglomerate pathologic adenopathy at the right cervical lymph node chain, extending inferior to the right thoracic inlet, as well as a left retropharyngeal hypermetabolic lymph node, but no evidence of distant metastasis (Fig. 2B and C). On initial physical and neurologic examination, the oncology team noted a large, firm, fixed right medial neck mass without overlying skin changes, and a normal cranial nerve exam.\n\nFig. 1 H&E stained cell block slides (A and B, 60X) demonstrating dysmorphic cells (arrows).

Full size image\n\nThe patient\u2019s case was discussed at the head and neck multidisciplinary tumor board, with a consensus opinion that this squamous cell carcinoma was indeed of thyroid origin. Extensive surgical resection including a laryngectomy, thyroidectomy, and reconstruction followed by adjuvant chemoradiation as a potential curative course was recommended. However, due to the morbidity and lifestyle implications associated with surgery, the patient declined surgery and instead chose to pursue concurrent chemoradiation with weekly chemotherapy. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was used to treat the right thyroid mass to 70 Gy in 35 fractions at 200 cGy per fraction, as well as bilateral retropharyngeal nodes cervical neck nodal levels IB, II, III, IV, and V to 63 Gy in 35 fractions at 180 cGy per fraction . The patient completed radiation with weekly concurrent carboplatin-paclitaxel over 7 weeks. During treatment, he developed grade 2 fatigue, grade 2 mucositis, grade 2 dermatitis, grade 3 dysphagia, and grade 3 dry mouth with thickened secretions with excessive mucus. The skin desquamation was treated with silver sulfadiazine and mineral oil-hydrophil petrolat. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed during the first week of treatment due to nutrition and oral intake difficulties at baseline, and the patient lost less than 15 lbs throughout the treatment. Long-term toxicity was significant for chronic xerostomia and dysphagia, requiring a permanent gastrostomy tube. He also developed treatment-related hypothyroidism and was started on levothyroxine approximately 3 months after completion of treatment, when his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was found to have gone up from 1.63 (baseline, normal) to 21 mIU/mL (elevated).\n\nFig. 3 Axial view of patient\u2019s CT-based radiation treatment plan. 6 MV photon beams were utilized, and patient was prescribed to 7000 cGy in 35 fractions to the isocenter.

Full size image\n\nAfter receiving concurrent chemoradiation, the patient underwent two additional cycles of high-dose carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel every 3 weeks. Follow-up imaging after concurrent chemoradiation suggested a partial therapeutic response. PET (18-fluorodeoxyglucose/18-FDG)/CT of the neck demonstrated that the thyroid mass had decreased in size from 5.0 \u00d7 5.2 cm, with maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) of 35.3, to 3.8 \u00d7 2.1 cm, with maximum SUV of 19.4 (Fig. 4A\u2013C). This was also apparent on physical examination, where the tumor was smaller, softer, and less tender to palpation. The right and left neck lymph nodes were also notably smaller and demonstrated less PET-avidity. Imaging of the chest, however, revealed pulmonary metastases up to 9 mm in size, as well as multiple bilateral hypermetabolic nodules (Fig. 4D and E).\n\nFig. 4 Post-concurrent chemoradiation PET/CT imaging with carboplatin/paclitaxel reveal a smaller thyroid tumor size (A) and decreased PET-avidity (B, C), but show new bilateral pulmonary metastases (D, E). Full size image\n\nIn light of the new pulmonary metastatic disease, additional systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel was recommended to the patient. However, he opted for immunotherapy instead due to previous chemotherapy side effects and subsequently completed nine cycles of pembrolizumab. Imaging studies obtained after the third cycle of pembrolizumab demonstrated an interval decrease in the size of multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally, suggesting a positive response to therapy . At the same time, however, a CT scan demonstrated an increase in the size of the thyroid mass . Additionally, new encasement of the distal common carotid artery, carotid bifurcation, and proximal internal carotid artery was present, and erosion of the thyroid cartilage was also identified. After the sixth cycle of pembrolizumab, imaging continued to demonstrate enlargement of the thyroid mass with increased extension to the tracheoesophageal groove, while the pulmonary nodules continued to get smaller (Fig. 5C and D). Following the ninth cycle of pembrolizumab, the thyroid mass had continued to enlarge, eroding the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, extending into the paraglottic space, and invading the cervical esophagus. No new or worsening pulmonary metastatic disease was identified at this time (Fig. 5E and F). The tenth cycle of pembrolizumab was halted due to leukocytosis (WBC 21.81 and ANC 19.05) and the patient\u2019s desire to pursue supportive care. Fifteen months after his initial diagnosis, the patient was transitioned to comfort care and died 3 months later. Autopsy was not performed as the patient\u2019s desire was to donate his body to science.\n\nFig. 5 Post-immunotherapy CT imaging demonstrates enlarging thyroid tumor but stable (white arrows) or decreased pulmonary metastases (dotted arrows) after three cycles (A, B), six cycles (C, D), and nine cycles (D, E) of pembrolizumab.

    "original_case": "A 35-year-old Mediterranean woman was diagnosed with a condition at the age of 7, when she was investigated for hematuria and proteinuria, confirmed by a renal biopsy on her father, revealing a familial chronic renal disease. Our patient was descended from a nonconsanguineous parent. Her mother was completely asymptomatic, while her father had been diagnosed with the same condition when he was 42 years of age, and he had been on hemodialysis for the last few years because of chronic renal failure. The pattern of this disease inheritance in her family suggested an X-linked type, as her brothers were asymptomatic. At the same time, her only sister had shown hematuria since she was a teenager. Genetic testing was offered to the patient and her offspring but declined as the test was not insured financially.\n\nAfter three successful pregnancies and 3 years from her last delivery, the patient is normotensive, had a normal kidney function test, and was not undergoing any specific treatment. However, recently she had been found to have some auditory changes from tinnitus, mild neurosensory hearing loss, and mild lenticular myopia caused by her anterior lenticonus.\n\nFirst pregnancy (2009)  \nAt the age of 23, the patient came to the antenatal clinics at 7 weeks of gestation, and an early ultrasound examination confirmed a pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and the blood pressure was 90/70 mmHg. Her baseline investigations showed a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dl, 2+ protein from urine analysis, and serum creatinine of 41 \u00b5mol/l (62.0\u2013106.0 \u00b5mol/l). Twenty-four-hour urine collection measured 1.870 g protein. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth assessment, proteinuria, and kidney function testing. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted to the obstetric unit for monitoring because of rising proteinuria of 4.300 g in 24 hours and a borderline amniotic fluid index at 34 weeks. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg.\n\nAt 37 weeks of gestation, 24-hour urine collection measured 5.694 g protein, creatinine 49 \u00b5mol/l, total protein 53.4 g/l (60\u201380 g/l), and albumin at 27.8 g/l (35\u201352 g/l). She had a cesarean section at 37 completed weeks for an obstetric reason (breech presentation) and delivered a healthy, 2530 g female newborn baby. Proteinuria dropped down to the early pregnancy levels shortly after delivery. The patient recovered smoothly after surgery and was discharged home with her newborn infant. The patient had a follow-up visit at the nephrology clinic after 2 weeks of her puerperium, which revealed proteinuria of +2 and creatinine of 52 \u00b5mol/l. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the second pregnancy.\n\nSecond pregnancy (2015)  \nAt age 30, the patient came once more to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 13 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg. There was a +1 protein in the urine, and the creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth and fetal well-being assessments, as well as the recording of proteinuria and creatinine levels. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted at 30 weeks of gestation so that her borderline amniotic fluid index could be assessed. At 34 weeks of gestation, the patient had an elevated blood pressure of 140/89 mmHg, for which she was again admitted to the hospital for observation. Proteinuria was 3.900 g in a 24-hour collection, serum creatinine was 44 \u00b5mol/l, hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dl, and the platelet count was 222 \u00d7 10^3/mm^3. The total serum protein was 51 g/l, albumin was 27.0 g/l, normal levels of alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase being 8.9 U/l and 15 U/l, respectively. She had a cesarean section due to a suspected dehiscence scar and gave birth to a male newborn infant weighing 2300 g, who was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The mother\u2019s proteinuria and blood pressure dropped shortly after 2 weeks of her delivery. The mother and the newborn infant were discharged home in good health. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the third pregnancy.\n\nThird pregnancy (2017)  \nAt age 32, the patient presented to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 12 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. A 24-hour urine collection showed 1.010 g in 2400 ml. The serum creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetrics and nephrology care was established with serial growth and fetal well-being assessment. At 28 weeks, during a routine antenatal visit, a dipstick for protein showed +3, while the 24-hour urine collection revealed 2.400 g in 1300 ml. Her blood pressure was normal all through her antenatal period. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. At 34 weeks, the protein in the 24-hour urine collection measured 2.900 g in 1200 ml, while serum creatinine was 45 \u00b5mol/l and hemoglobin level 9.1 g/dl. A cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks for obstetric reasons, and a male newborn of 2500 g was delivered and sent to the nursery. After 2 days, the mother and her newborn infant were discharged home. After 4 weeks, the patient was reevaluated once more, and she was doing well, with a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg and a 24-hour urine collection measuring 1.700 g in 2200 ml. There were no auditory or ophthalmological complaints. Late follow-up was lost apart from a few visits documented to the auditory and ophthalmology clinics.",

    "original_case": "A 68-year-old Caucasian male was referred to the emergency department with progressive complaints of fatigue, dyspnea, and poor appetite since 12 days. He had also fallen down and needed help getting back up. The patient was a retiree who had previously worked in law enforcement. He had no significant past medical history and did not take regular medications. He had a long-term history of smoking (80 pack-years) and consumed three alcoholic drinks daily. His general practitioner had noted a new diabetes mellitus with a glucose of 28 mmol/L when the patient presented in his practice 5 days earlier, but had not started treatment. The patient did not report coughing, chills, or chest pain. On physical examination, he appeared dyspneic and had an altered mental status but could still speak complete sentences. He had a blood pressure of 141/105 mmHg, pulse rate of 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% without supplemental oxygen, and temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. He had cold extremities with a capillary refill < 3 seconds. No other signs such as peripheral edema, heart murmurs, pericardial friction rub, or pulmonary crackles were present. Excepting the altered mental status, the global neurological examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 341 mg/L, neutrophilic leukocytosis with leukocyte count of 12.6 \u00d7 10^9/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 96 mmol/mol, mildly elevated hepatic transaminases, and low serum myocardial markers. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed partially compensated respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.49, pCO2 3.5 kPa, pO2 12.6 kPa, HCO3 19.4 mmol/L, base excess \u22122.4 mmol/L, sO2 97%) (see Additional file 1 for all laboratory values at first presentation). Chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis but no evident pleural effusion or infiltration . Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a QS pattern in V1\u20134, suggestive of an old anterior wall myocardial infarction. Point-of-care echocardiography was performed and visualized large, circumferential pericardial effusion . Also, wall motion abnormalities were seen that supported the theory that the patient had experienced an out-of-hospital anterior myocardial infarction in the weeks to months before the current presentation. The day after admission, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed with immediate drainage of 600 mL of purulent fluid. Analysis of the fluid indicated a leukocyte count of 267 \u00d7 10^9/L, total protein of 51 g/L, and lactate dehydrogenase pericardial fluid-to-serum ratio of 8.7. As Gram stains of blood revealed Gram-positive diplococci, antibiotic therapy consisting of continuous, intravenous infusion with 6 million international units benzylpenicillin daily was initiated. At admission, blood culture specimens for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria had been collected and directly transported to a BacT/Alert Virtuo system (BioM\u00e9rieux). Later on, these blood cultures as well as pericardial fluid cultures grew (serotype unknown). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that the isolated strain was susceptible to a variety of antibiotics including penicillin, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.016 mg/L. Initially, insulin and metformin were started for the newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Acetylsalicylic acid and low-molecular-weight heparin were started to prevent occlusive vascular events. Moreover, during the admission, several other medications were started for cardiovascular protection, to treat electrolyte imbalances, and to supplement vitamins because of the previous alcohol use (see Additional file 2 for all medication administered during admission). \n\nFig. 1 Chest X-ray showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis with mild volume loss.

Daily, bedside transthoracic echocardiography confirmed adequate drainage of the pericardial effusion. The patient did not develop any symptoms that pointed us in the direction of a primary focus (for instance, no coughing, urinary complaints, or back pains). Repeated chest X-rays did not show signs of pneumonia or empyema. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody assay was negative, as were tests for other microorganisms (ELISpot for detection of M. tuberculosis; hepatitis C virus serology; and feces assays for C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and norovirus). The CRP level dropped to 102 mg/L. However, 6 days post-admission, the patient\u2019s condition suddenly deteriorated with a blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg, sinus tachycardia of 131 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute. A small amount of sanguineous fluid drained through the pericardial catheter. Echocardiography revealed reaccumulation of pericardial fluid including blood clot formation at the level of the right chamber in the pericardial cavity. Moreover, the wide inferior vena cava, right ventricular compression, and increased respiratory inflow variation (> 25%) over the mitral valve were indicative of cardiac tamponade. Attempts to clear the drain blockage by flushing with saline and adjusting the catheter\u2019s location in the pericardial cavity did not lead to evacuation of any pericardial fluid. Thus, as removal of the obstructing blood clot through the pericardial catheter proved impossible, the patient was transferred to a tertiary hospital to undergo emergent cardiothoracic surgery. Immediately before transfer, the patient went into cardiac arrest and he was ultimately transported with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Unfortunately, surgical removal of the clot proved unsuccessful, and the patient died only hours after onset of his sudden hemodynamic deterioration.

The swelling was small initially and progressively increased in size to attain the current size. She had visited a nearby health center on multiple occasions for this complaint and took unspecified antibiotics, but experienced no improvement. Apart from the local mild pain and discomfort, there was no history of cough, fever, weight loss, night sweating, or other constitutional symptoms. She has no family history (first-degree relatives) of diabetes, hypertension, or any other remarkable noncommunicable disease including cancer. Her past medical history is not significant, except for occasional mild dyspeptic symptoms; she took unspecified over-the-counter anti-acids a couple of times for her dyspepsia as the symptoms arose. She has no history of admission to hospital. She has no history of any form of surgical procedure. She has no history of smoking. Except for the mild-to-moderate amount of local alcohol beverages she consumed on holidays, she has no history of excess alcohol consumption. She is a janitor in a public school. She is unmarried and lives with her parents. She has a fianc\u00e9 and uses a combination of natural calendar method and male condom for contraception. She has no history of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or injectable or intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) use. She has no history of pregnancy. She reported that she has regular menstrual cycles and no significant past obstetric or gynecologic history. On physical examination, her general appearance was stable, healthy looking, and ambulating. Vital signs were as follows: pulse rate, 82 beats per minute; blood pressure, 110/80 mmHg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; temperature, 36.2 \u00b0C. She has pink conjunctiva, non-icteric sclera, and no abnormal finding on head and neck examination. On lymphoglandular system (LGS) examination, there was an approximately 5\u2009\u00d7\u20094 cm solitary mass in the left axilla . It was firm in consistency, nontender, well defined, mobile, and completely separated from the left breast. Skin over the mass was normal with no nipple, areola, or ulceration. There were no clinically significant findings detected on examination of breasts, right axilla, or the other externally accessible lymph node regions. On chest examination, it was symmetrical and moved with respirations, and clear breath sounds were heard on auscultation. On precordial and cardiovascular examinations, the normal S1 and S2 heart sounds were heard, there was no murmur or gallop, and all the peripheral arterial pulses were palpable with strong and regular pulse. Abdomen was soft to palpation. No hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or mass was detected, and there were no signs of fluid collection. No costovertebral angle tenderness or abnormal finding was detected on genitourinary system (GUS) examination. No pedal or other subcutaneous edema was identified on musculoskeletal examination. No palmar pallor or skin lesions were seen on integumentary system examination. On neurologic examination, she was conscious, alert, and fully oriented to time, place, and person. Cranial nerve examination revealed normal findings. No motor or sensory deficit was detected, and deep tendon reflexes were normal. On the basis of the above findings, a provisional clinical impression of axillary lymphadenopathy due to either lymphoma or tuberculosis was considered.

    "original_case": "A 36-year-old nulliparous Nigerian petty trader presented at the gynecology outpatient clinic with a painless abdominal mass of 1-year duration. The mass first appeared as a small induration and progressively increased in size. She had menarche at age 14 years, with 3 days of menstruation in a 28-day cycle. There was no history of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and bowel or urinary change, and no significant past medical history although she was taking the antihypertensive amlodipine (tablet, 10 mg daily) for hypertension. She had a surgical history of open myomectomy for symptomatic fibroids 3 years prior to presentation. There was no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus, asthma, cancer or sickle cell disease. She defined herself as a social drinker and non-smoker (no history of smoking). The results of a prior ultrasound examination at a different hospital suggested a condition, and based on this scan, she was offered a hysterectomy at that hospital prior to her presentation at our own facility. General and neurological examinations were unremarkable, with a pulse rate of 74 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, and a body temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. Abdominal with bimanual pelvic examination revealed a giant abdominopelvic mass, equivalent to a 36-week gestational uterus, extending in all directions to fill the abdominal cavity. It was not attached to the overlying structures but seemed to have originated from the pelvic cavity. Subsequently, based on evidence of this abdominopelvic mass, we carried out a preoperative work-up, with the results showing a packed cell volume (PCV) of 36%, fasting blood sugar of 80 mg/dl, blood group O+ (positive), sero-negativity for hepatitis B and C, and normal values for urinalysis, electrolytes, urea, and creatinine. The abdominopelvic scan revealed an anteverted, empty, and markedly bulky uterus that measured about 283 \u00d7 156 mm, with the fundus close to the xiphisternum. The endometrial stripe measured about 4 mm in thickness, with what appeared to be diffuse enlargement of the uterine myometrium with no succinct myometrial mass. There was no adnexal mass and no fluid in the Pouch of Douglas. The visceral organs showed nothing of significance. A computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were not performed due to the unavailability of these facilities. Two units of whole blood were cross matched for her, and she then underwent an exploratory laparotomy for the excision of the tumor. Intra-operation findings included a huge 6.5-kg abdominal mass of firm consistency and 40 cm in diameter . There was adhesion of the omentum with markedly enlarged omental vessels. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries appeared to be normal. There was no retroperitoneal involvement. However, there was an extension of the tumor to the left sub-umbilical part of the abdominal wall. Complete excision of the tumor with a wide margin and partial omentectomy was carried out, and the anterior abdominal wall was closed in layers without prosthesis. The postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. The histology study showed a specific type of fibromatosis with an unremarkable fibrofatty tissue stalk excision margin (Fig. 2 a, b).",

There was no history of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and bowel or urinary change, and no significant past medical history although she was taking the antihypertensive amlodipine (tablet, 10 mg daily) for hypertension. She had a surgical history of open myomectomy for symptomatic fibroids 3 years prior to presentation. There was no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus, asthma, cancer or sickle cell disease. She defined herself as a social drinker and non-smoker (no history of smoking). The results of a prior ultrasound examination at a different hospital suggested a condition, and based on this scan, she was offered a hysterectomy at that hospital prior to her presentation at our own facility. General and neurological examinations were unremarkable, with a pulse rate of 74 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, and a body temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. Abdominal with bimanual pelvic examination revealed a giant abdominopelvic mass, equivalent to a 36-week gestational uterus, extending in all directions to fill the abdominal cavity. It was not attached to the overlying structures but seemed to have originated from the pelvic cavity. Subsequently, based on evidence of this abdominopelvic mass, we carried out a preoperative work-up, with the results showing a packed cell volume (PCV) of 36%, fasting blood sugar of 80 mg/dl, blood group O+ (positive), sero-negativity for hepatitis B and C, and normal values for urinalysis, electrolytes, urea, and creatinine. The abdominopelvic scan revealed an anteverted, empty, and markedly bulky uterus that measured about 283 \u00d7 156 mm, with the fundus close to the xiphisternum. The endometrial stripe measured about 4 mm in thickness, with what appeared to be diffuse enlargement of the uterine myometrium with no succinct myometrial mass. There was no adnexal mass and no fluid in the Pouch of Douglas. The visceral organs showed nothing of significance. A computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were not performed due to the unavailability of these facilities. Two units of whole blood were cross matched for her, and she then underwent an exploratory laparotomy for the excision of the tumor. Intra-operation findings included a huge 6.5-kg abdominal mass of firm consistency and 40 cm in diameter . There was adhesion of the omentum with markedly enlarged omental vessels. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries appeared to be normal. There was no retroperitoneal involvement. However, there was an extension of the tumor to the left sub-umbilical part of the abdominal wall. Complete excision of the tumor with a wide margin and partial omentectomy was carried out, and the anterior abdominal wall was closed in layers without prosthesis. The postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. The histology study showed a specific type of fibromatosis with an unremarkable fibrofatty tissue stalk excision margin (Fig. 2 a, b).",

In addition, there was no specific medication, smoking history, or alcohol consumption. The cause of the accident was a methanol-based paint spill on his clothes that ignited; this incident occurred at a plating factory (Fig. 1: day 1). He was transferred to our hospital for emergency treatment. On arrival, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 165/102 mmHg, and pulse rate of 90/minute. His body temperature was 37.3 degrees Celsius. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was E4 V5 M6, and there was no motor or sensory paralysis. Physical examination revealed 25% total-body-surface-area flame injuries (7% partial thickness on the trunk and right hand and 18% full thickness on the right arm, both legs, and chest). There were no problems with hand function. On day 2 after admission, the wounds on his two thighs and right arm were debrided, and Integra dermal regeneration templates (Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA) were applied. On day 9 after admission, the wounds on his right lower leg, right arm, and chest were debrided, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. On day 16 after admission, the Integra silicone sheet was removed, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. Epithelialization had occurred in most parts of the injury; however, the graft failed in the proximal one-third portion of the left thigh, resulting in an ulcer.

The meshed split-thickness skin graft (STSG) was fixed, and NPWT was applied to both the donor and recipient sites Full size image On day 37 after admission, an operation was performed. The ulcer surface was debrided, and an 11/1000-inch (0.28 mm) skin graft was taken from the ipsilateral thigh and meshed, using a 1:1.5 ratio. A slightly larger skin graft was taken, and the excess skin graft was immediately regrafted to the donor site. The regrafted skin was meshed using a 1:1.5 ratio, the same as the recipient site. NPWT (INFOV.A.C.\u2122 Therapy System, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) was then applied to both the donor and recipient sites with a continuous negative pressure of 125 mmHg. A silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh) was inserted between the skin graft and polyurethane foam dressing (V.A.C. GranuFoam Dressing, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) to avoid damage to the skin graft (Fig. 1: day 37). On days 37 and 38 after admission, 1 g of cefazolin was administered intravenously every 8 hours as perioperative prophylaxis. On day 43 after admission, the polyurethane foam dressing was removed from both the donor and recipient sites. Although the regrafted skin at the donor site was taken completely, the skin graft was not found at the recipient site, and the entire area was covered with granulation tissue (Fig. 2: day 43, left). No granulation tissue overgrowth was observed at the donor site. The staples that had held the grafts in place were embedded in the granulation tissue and were removed. On the same day, the wound was cleaned under running tap water, and small islands of epithelialization were visible under the granulation tissue. NPWT was ceased, and topical treatment with a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb) was applied (Fig. 2: day 43, right). Rapid epithelialization of the ulcer was observed as the granulation tissue regressed, and epithelialization of both the donor and recipient sites was almost completed on day 48 after admission (5 days after NPWT cessation) (Fig. 2: day 48). No significant change was observed between pre- and postoperative laboratory findings (). In addition, no significant findings were observed in urinalysis on day 17 (), and no further urinalysis was performed during hospitalization because no specific symptoms appeared.

His left forearm was caught between the motor vehicle and the road, and became highly compressed and retracted. The patient was hemodynamically stable with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15, a blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, body temperature of 36.1 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Laboratory test results were as follows: hemoglobin 16.3 g/dL; hematocrit 46%; white blood cells 8100/mm3, with no left shift; platelets 195,000/mm3; urea 14.5 mg/dL; creatinine 0.8 mg/dL; total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL; direct bilirubin 0.07 mg/dL. Major vascular and visceral injuries were not suspected. Physical examination and radiography showed an open radial shaft fracture with marked swelling of the left forearm . The patient was given 0.5 mL of tetanus toxoid vaccine intramuscularly and administered prophylactic antibiotic using intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g. Compartment pressure was measured in three different areas of the forearm, showing 40 mmHg in the volar component and 30 mmHg in the dorsal forearm compartment. Five hours after the injury, surgery was performed under general anesthesia. First, we made a curvilinear skin incision on the volar aspect of the forearm from the biceps tendon to the palm of the hand for carpal tunnel release . We performed a debridement of the involved muscles; however, we could not perform an internal fixation or immediate reconstruction owing to the risk of advancing the myonecrosis of the forearm muscles. After release of the superficial and deep flexor compartments, pressure in the dorsal compartment decreased. The wound was closed with vessel tape, utilizing the shoelace technique. After the release, the patient was not able to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. At second-look operation (3 days after the initial release), swelling of the left forearm had reduced with no evidence of infection. Therefore, we performed open reduction and internal fixation for the left radius fracture and PL tendon transfer to the FPL tendon. Intraoperatively, the presence of the intact PL tendon was confirmed. The PL tendon was advanced to the FPL tendon, and an interlacing suture was performed thrice. The tendon was transferred with the wrist in 30\u00b0 of dorsiflexion and the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the thumb in 45\u00b0 of flexion. The wrist and thumb were immobilized in a slightly flexed position using a splint for 3 weeks, following which active flexion and extension exercises of the thumb were started. The patient was discharged 32 days after hospital admission in a relatively good state of health. Six weeks after the reconstruction, passive extension exercises of the thumb were started. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had no complaints and had returned to his former job, despite slight residual muscle weakness of the FPL. The patient regained the full range of thumb interphalangeal joint flexion\u2013extension. At 2-year follow-up, the patient had acquired 88% of pinch strength compared with the contralateral hand and scored 11.4 on QuickDASH score.",

    "original_case": "Patient 1 is a 60-year-old Caucasian female with BRAF wild type unknown primary (tumor mutation burden 4 mutations/megabase) who originally presented with a renal mass and had a nephrectomy positive for melanoma. She developed lung disease and was started on pembrolizumab. After 3 months, her lung disease progressed, and she was switched to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg for four cycles with concurrent radiotherapy to a dominant lung lesion. Her maintenance nivolumab was halted after 2 months as she required steroids for radiation pneumonitis. She subsequently received anti-PD-1 directed therapy with anti-LAG-3 on a clinical trial, but her disease progressed after two cycles with progressive bilateral pulmonary and pleural based masses, increase in a right pericardial deposit, enlargement of a soft tissue mass adjacent to the spleen and a nodule adjacent to the right kidney with an unchanged lytic lesion within the L3 vertebral body. She received 18 Gy in one fraction of palliative radiation to the L3 spinal lesion 3 days prior to HD IL-2 for pain (day 1). She was then admitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses on days 4 through 7. Treatment was held for colitis and atrial fibrillation. She was administered nivolumab 480 mg on day 19. The patient was subsequently admitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses on days 22 through 25. Therapy was held due to colitis and shortness of breath, with atrial fibrillation after dosing that resolved in a few days per usual after stopping HD IL-2. CT scans on day 53 showed an 8% decrease in target lesions and overall stable disease per RECIST v1.1. The patient elected to receive a second course of nivolumab and HD IL-2 therapy with nivolumab 480 mg given on day 53 followed by standard bolus HD IL-2 on day 58 (7 doses) and day 77 (8 doses), both limited by fatigue. Usual side effects from HD IL-2 included colitis, renal insufficiency, shortness of breath, electrolyte issues, hepatitis, and mucositis all resolving to grade 1 or better at the time of dismissal from the hospital. She received two more doses of nivolumab 480 mg on schedule every 4 weeks with scans on day 73 and day 122 showing disease stability. Two months after her last dose of HD IL-2, she elected to change therapies to chemotherapy due to progressive pain. Scans on day 182, 6 months after the initiation of therapy, showed progression of disease due to growth of nontarget lesions.\n\nPatient 2 is a 56-year-old Caucasian male with NF1 mutated cutaneous melanoma (tumor mutation burden 1.3 mutations/megabase) who originally presented with a left finger stage IIIC melanoma. He was treated with surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Scans showed extensive lymph node disease, and he was started on ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which was discontinued after three cycles due to hypophysitis ultimately requiring thyroid and adrenal hormone replacement. His cancer subsequently progressed, and he was started on a clinical trial of nivolumab with an anti-LAG-3 antibody, but after one cycle had clinical progression with extensive chest wall disease. He was started on palliative radiation to the chest wall mass and received 45 Gy in ten fractions on days 1 through 11. He received 480 mg of nivolumab on day 6. He was admitted for HD IL-2 course 1 cycle 1 and received 11 doses on days 12 through 16. Treatment was held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. He also experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, hyperbilirubinemia, colitis, and recurrent fevers after completion of HD IL-2 dosing, which resolved by discharge. He was admitted for cycle 2 of HD IL-2 and received 10 doses on days 33 through 36. Treatment was held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. Nivolumab 480 mg was administered on day 39. Digital photography on day 72  and CT scans on day 71  showed dramatic improvement of disease in the chest wall and lungs (not irradiated). He had clinical improvement in a left upper arm lesion, which was not in the imaging field. The patient received further nivolumab on day 72 and was admitted for a second course of HD IL-2 on day 77 (10 doses). Treatment was again held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. He was admitted again on day 90 and received nine doses before therapy was held for altered mental status and abdominal pain. Nivolumab was administered on day 108, and subsequent scans on day 127 confirmed response to therapy with further decrease in target lesions. Scans on day 197 showed no evidence of disease. Follow-up scans on day 266, day 350, and day 454 also showed no evidence of disease. He later developed progressive anemia, and subsequent endoscopic evaluation on day 547 showed a bleeding mass in his stomach that was biopsy proven. He elected to enroll into hospice and died on day 566.\n\nPatient 3 is a 55-year-old Caucasian female with BRAF wild type cutaneous melanoma (tumor mutation burden 4 mutations/megabase), aortic stenosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient had excisions of two melanomas 20 years prior, followed by adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, cisplatin, IL-2, and IFNa. She had recurrent melanoma 2 years prior to presentation and received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg for four cycles followed by nivolumab maintenance with no clear benefit. She had talimogene laherparepvec injections, which were poorly tolerated, followed by resection, and an additional four doses of ipilimumab and nivolumab without benefit. The patient subsequently received arginase on a clinical trial with progression followed by a dose of carboplatin and paclitaxel for a progressive malignant pericardial effusion. She received 39 Gy in 13 fractions of palliative radiation to her pelvic disease from day 1 until day 21. She had nivolumab 480 mg on day 19. The patient was admitted for HD IL-2 and received eight doses on days 22 through 25. Dosing was interrupted at dose number 4 due to fevers, rigors, and chest ache during red blood cell transfusion, possibly secondary to transfusion reaction. Therapy was resumed after 8 h and was stopped after her eighth dose due to worsening respiratory status with increased oxygen requirements and respiratory rate. The patient was dismissed 48 h after the last dose of HD IL-2 and symptoms resolved. The patient was readmitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses from day 41 through 44. Therapy was held after dose 9 due to abdominal pain secondary to colitis and worsening respiratory status. The patient received nivolumab 480 mg on day 55. CT scans on day 71 showed decreased tumor burden in bilateral pelvic masses, with the right pelvic mass being the primary radiation site. Formal response assessment for this patient is not possible due to the inclusion of measurable lesions in the radiation field. Further cycles were not given as she fractured her arm while working and subsequently chose to pursue other treatments.",

    "original_case": "A 65-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital with a 12-hour history of diffuse colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain had arisen suddenly and presented a gross localization to the upper quadrants. He had failed to pass feces and gas for the last 2 days and reported no significant abdominal symptoms before the event except for mild stypsis. His past medical history included a previous thoracoscopic mitral valve repair and mild renal insufficiency secondary to ectopic hypoplastic left kidney located in the pelvis. He had no history of previous abdominal surgery. Upon physical examination, we found significant abdominal distension, severe spontaneous pain in the upper abdomen without guarding or positive Blumberg sign, and tympany on percussion. The body temperature was 37 \u00b0C, and all vital parameters were normal. Digital rectal examination revealed empty ampulla with normal fecal residues. A nasogastric tube was positioned, and about 400 ml of biliary effluent was drained.\n\nBlood tests revealed neutrophilia (leukocytes 9.98 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl; neutrophils 9.08 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 65 mg/L). Abdominal X-ray, in turn, showed diffuse abdominal distension of both small and large bowel with multiple air\u2013fluid levels. The small bowel presented valvulae conniventes without mucosal thickening, while the large bowel showed coprostasis and regular haustration. Cecum diameter measured about 6 cm .\n\nFig. 1\nAbdominal X-ray\nFull size image\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was thus performed showing an anatomical abnormality of the colon and diffuse dilation of both the small bowel and colon. The sigmoid colon was elongated and formed a distended loop in the subhepatic recess above the right flexure. Cecum and ascending colon were in their normal position, while the left ectopic kidney was found on the left side of the pelvis. Pancreas, duodenum, right kidney, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric artery had no significant abnormalities .\n\nFig. 2\nCoronal view of abdominal Computed tomography scan (from anterior to posterior): (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery\nFull size image\nImportantly, the lack of left kidney bulk in the left flank altered the course of the colonic portions corresponding to the splenic flexure and descending segment. The splenic flexure was twisted counterclockwise on the frontal plane, causing the descending colon to be more medial and posterior. The latter therefore crossed posteriorly to the body of pancreas near the L2 vertebral body and descended anteriorly to the psoas muscle. From there onward, the course of the sigmoid colon could be divided into four segments. The first segment began in the left iliac fossa, turning right and crossing the midline at the level of the L5\u2013S1 intervertebral disc near the upper pole of the left ectopic kidney. The second segment turned sharply upward directed to the subhepatic recess running anterior to the inferior vena cava and crossing the right common iliac artery anteriorly and the ileocolic vessels and proximal transverse colon posteriorly. The third segment formed a dilated loop in contact with the gallbladder and the lower aspect of the right hepatic lobe. The fourth segment continued in an inferior direction running along the right side of the inferior vena cava, crossing the right side of the promontory, and terminating in the rectum. Since the third part was dilated to 5 cm in diameter and the second and fourth parts were compressed, the sigmoid colon appeared to be involved in a closed-loop occlusion. A C-shaped fluid-filled loop of ileum with beak-like proximal and distal narrowing was found near the fourth part of sigmoid colon, resembling a closed-loop small bowel obstruction. Both the ileal loop and the sigmoid colon appeared to be incarcerated in a narrow space behind the ileocolic vessels.\n\nThe inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was also characterized by an abnormal course. This originated from the aorta 2.5 cm above the aortic bifurcation and ran rightward, giving rise to a long recurrent left colic artery and some directed upward sigmoid branches. It then turned downward into the pelvis as the superior hemorrhoidal artery. The left colic artery had an extremely long course: it originated from the IMA via a common trunk with the first sigmoid artery to the right side of the aorta and crossed it running left and upward. The left renal artery originated on the anterior face of the aortic bifurcation and flowed downward to the ectopic kidney located on the left in the small pelvis .\n\nFig. 3\nSchematic drawing of the anatomical abnormalities. (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery; (12) first sigmoid artery; (13) inferior vena cava; (14) aorta; (15) ectopic left kidney\nFull size image\nGiven the complex anatomy, we opted for exploratory laparoscopy, which revealed a recess on the right posterior peritoneum traversed by the sigmoid colon. An ileal loop was trapped within this space, resulting in an internal hernia with upstream bowel dilation. This recess was limited anteriorly by Toldt\u2019s fascia, the ascending colon and adhesions spanning between the ascending colon and the abdominal wall. These adhesions were similar to the Ladd\u2019s bands described in malrotations. The ileal loop was extracted from the recess and did not appear ischemic, with deflation ensuing shortly after this procedure. The sigmoid colon was then extracted, revealing thick adhesions between the sigmoid colon and the posterior abdominal wall forcing the sigmoid colon to recoil inside the recess once traction from laparoscopic clamp was eased. Given the inability to safely lyse these adhesions, we decided to convert to open surgery. The adhesions of the sigmoid colon and its mesosigmoid with the retroperitoneum were partially lysed, allowing the sigmoid colon to remain in natural position without tension. Thereafter, a suture of the hernial breach was performed between the lower edge of Toldt\u2019s fascia and the retroperitoneum. We did not perform complete lysis of sigmoid colon adhesions as this would have led to the complete mobilization of a dolichosigma with significant risk of volvulus.

    "rewritten_case": "A 65-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital with a 12-hour history of diffuse colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain had arisen suddenly and presented a gross localization to the upper quadrants. He had failed to pass feces and gas for the last 2 days and reported no significant abdominal symptoms before the event except for mild stypsis. His past medical history included a previous thoracoscopic mitral valve repair and mild renal insufficiency secondary to ectopic hypoplastic left kidney located in the pelvis. He had no history of previous abdominal surgery. Upon physical examination, we found significant abdominal distension, severe spontaneous pain in the upper abdomen without guarding or positive Blumberg sign, and tympany on percussion. The body temperature was 37 \u00b0C, and all vital parameters were normal. Digital rectal examination revealed empty ampulla with normal fecal residues. A nasogastric tube was positioned, and about 400 ml of biliary effluent was drained.\n\nBlood tests revealed neutrophilia (leukocytes 9.98 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl; neutrophils 9.08 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 65 mg/L). Abdominal X-ray, in turn, showed diffuse abdominal distension of both small and large bowel with multiple air\u2013fluid levels. The small bowel presented valvulae conniventes without mucosal thickening, while the large bowel showed coprostasis and regular haustration. Cecum diameter measured about 6 cm .\n\nFig. 1\nAbdominal X-ray\nFull size image\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was thus performed showing an anatomical abnormality of the colon and diffuse dilation of both the small bowel and colon. The sigmoid colon was elongated and formed a distended loop in the subhepatic recess above the right flexure. Cecum and ascending colon were in their normal position, while the left ectopic kidney was found on the left side of the pelvis. Pancreas, duodenum, right kidney, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric artery had no significant abnormalities .\n\nFig. 2\nCoronal view of abdominal Computed tomography scan (from anterior to posterior): (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery\nFull size image\nImportantly, the lack of left kidney bulk in the left flank altered the course of the colonic portions corresponding to the splenic flexure and descending segment. The splenic flexure was twisted counterclockwise on the frontal plane, causing the descending colon to be more medial and posterior. The latter therefore crossed posteriorly to the body of pancreas near the L2 vertebral body and descended anteriorly to the psoas muscle. From there onward, the course of the sigmoid colon could be divided into four segments. The first segment began in the left iliac fossa, turning right and crossing the midline at the level of the L5\u2013S1 intervertebral disc near the upper pole of the left ectopic kidney. The second segment turned sharply upward directed to the subhepatic recess running anterior to the inferior vena cava and crossing the right common iliac artery anteriorly and the ileocolic vessels and proximal transverse colon posteriorly. The third segment formed a dilated loop in contact with the gallbladder and the lower aspect of the right hepatic lobe. The fourth segment continued in an inferior direction running along the right side of the inferior vena cava, crossing the right side of the promontory, and terminating in the rectum. Since the third part was dilated to 5 cm in diameter and the second and fourth parts were compressed, the sigmoid colon appeared to be involved in a closed-loop occlusion. A C-shaped fluid-filled loop of ileum with beak-like proximal and distal narrowing was found near the fourth part of sigmoid colon, resembling a closed-loop small bowel obstruction. Both the ileal loop and the sigmoid colon appeared to be incarcerated in a narrow space behind the ileocolic vessels.\n\nThe inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was also characterized by an abnormal course. This originated from the aorta 2.5 cm above the aortic bifurcation and ran rightward, giving rise to a long recurrent left colic artery and some directed upward sigmoid branches. It then turned downward into the pelvis as the superior hemorrhoidal artery. The left colic artery had an extremely long course: it originated from the IMA via a common trunk with the first sigmoid artery to the right side of the aorta and crossed it running left and upward. The left renal artery originated on the anterior face of the aortic bifurcation and flowed downward to the ectopic kidney located on the left in the small pelvis .\n\nFig. 3\nSchematic drawing of the anatomical abnormalities. (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery; (12) first sigmoid artery; (13) inferior vena cava; (14) aorta; (15) ectopic left kidney\nFull size image\nGiven the complex anatomy, we opted for exploratory laparoscopy, which revealed a recess on the right posterior peritoneum traversed by the sigmoid colon. An ileal loop was trapped within this space, resulting in an internal hernia with upstream bowel dilation. This recess was limited anteriorly by Toldt\u2019s fascia, the ascending colon and adhesions spanning between the ascending colon and the abdominal wall. These adhesions were similar to the Ladd\u2019s bands described in malrotations. The ileal loop was extracted from the recess and did not appear ischemic, with deflation ensuing shortly after this procedure. The sigmoid colon was then extracted, revealing thick adhesions between the sigmoid colon and the posterior abdominal wall forcing the sigmoid colon to recoil inside the recess once traction from laparoscopic clamp was eased. Given the inability to safely lyse these adhesions, we decided to convert to open surgery. The adhesions of the sigmoid colon and its mesosigmoid with the retroperitoneum were partially lysed, allowing the sigmoid colon to remain in natural position without tension. Thereafter, a suture of the hernial breach was performed between the lower edge of Toldt\u2019s fascia and the retroperitoneum. We did not perform complete lysis of sigmoid colon adhesions as this would have led to the complete mobilization of a dolichosigma with significant risk of volvulus. The procedure was completed with appendicectomy and positioning of abdominal drainage in the pelvis .\n\nFig. 4\nIntraoperative images:\na ileal loop and sigmoid colon in the hernia breach.\nb Ileal loop was extracted from the hernia breach, and the sigmoid colon was carefully extracted.\nc Complete extraction of sigmoid colon shows fixation with the retroperitoneum (1) sigmoid colon; (2) incarcerated ileal loop; (3) adhesions between ascending colon and abdominal wall; (4) ascending colon; (5) adhesions between sigmoid colon and right peritoneum; (6) hernial breach.\nS cranial, I caudal, L left, R right\nFull size image",

The child was third born to second-degree consanguineous parents by lower-segment cesarean section due to cephalopelvic disproportion. Birth weight was 3.1 kg with uneventful perinatal history. There was maternal history of normal healthy live birth in the first pregnancy and spontaneous miscarriages in second and fourth pregnancies in early trimesters. The fourth pregnancy was associated with Down syndrome. The mother was given antenatal progesterone for excess bleeding in the first trimester. From 2 weeks of age, she presented with lethargy, sweating, and breathlessness on feeding. Later on, she presented with recurrent episodes of aspirations with severe lower respiratory infections. Cardiac examination revealed a holosystolic murmur suggestive of ventricular septal defect (VSD). Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with features suggestive of pneumonia . Echocardiography (ECHO) showed moderate VSD (6\u20137 cm subaortic perimembranous VSD), dilated left atrium and left ventricle, trivial aortic regurgitation with aortic cusp collapse, dilated pulmonary artery system with flow acceleration across pulmonary valve, and half-systemic pulmonary artery pressure with normal left ventricular systolic function . There was no pericardial effusion or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. She was managed medically with decongestive medications and antibiotics for lower respiratory infections. She was noted to have laryngomalacia. At 3 months of age, decreased motor movements were noted. She was gaining weight till 5 months of age, after which there was flattening of the growth curve and failure to thrive. At 6 months, she had developmental arrest followed by progressive neuroregression. She also had severe startle response since 8 months of age. Then, she started having generalized recurrent seizures from 9 months onward. The epileptic episodes were mostly focal with secondary generalization, with the most severe event reported as having frequency of ten seizure episodes within 2 hours time period despite anticonvulsant therapy. She had also macrocephaly with coarse facial features, persistent laryngomalacia, and hyperacusis. There was no muscle atrophy. Central hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, and a positive Babinski reflex were elicited. Organomegaly was absent. Ophthalmological examination showed bilateral macular cherry-red spots and an inability to fixate the eyes. At 12 months, she developed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as reactive airway disease. Gastrostomy tube feeding was also commenced. She had frequent episodes of hospitalizations due to repeated aspiration pneumonia, reactive airway diseases, and other central nervous system complications.

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Japanese man with a chief complaint of hoarseness visited the Otolaryngology Department at our hospital. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a tumor, with its major axis measuring approximately 40 mm in the left upper lobe of the lung. The hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were also swollen . Primary lung cancer was suspected, and the patient was directed to the Department of Respiratory Medicine on the same day that he was admitted to the Otolaryngology Department. He was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by bronchoscopy. We performed transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) for the primary lesion in the left upper lobe and endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the mediastinal lymph nodes 1 week after the first visit. Genetic mutation testing was not performed because the sample was insufficient. Subsequently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) was performed, and abnormal accumulation was observed in the longitudinal hilar lymph nodes (#4L, #5, #10L), vertebral body, and left pleura. The results of the 18F-FDG PET/CT and other findings led to the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma [cT2bN2M1c (PUL, OSS); stage IVB]. We recommended rebiopsy considering the possibility of a genetic mutation, but the patient refused the examination because of strong coughing during the first bronchoscopy and progressive symptoms of hoarseness. The patient strongly desired an early treatment, so we initiated first-line therapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) 3 weeks after the first visit. However, the patient developed grade 2 renal dysfunction [creatinine, 1.83 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 31.23 mL/min/1.73 m2], making it difficult to continue the therapy . We informed the patient about the need for a second bronchoscopy for consideration of further treatment and obtained his consent. Bronchoscopy was performed again, and the patient was diagnosed with ALK-positive NSCLC (immunohistochemistry, 3+; fluorescence in situ hybridization, 56%). In addition, progressive disease was noted . Development of progressive disease required approximately 9 months, and cisplatin and pemetrexed were administered over four cycles, after which pemetrexed alone was administered over five cycles. Thereafter, second-line therapy with alectinib (300 mg/day) was initiated. Three months after starting alectinib, chest CT showed that the primary lesion had shrunk, and we judged it to be a partial response, but the ground-glass opacities and infiltration continued to spread on both sides (Figs. 1d, 2). At this time, the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion, and his saturation of percutaneous oxygen was approximately 82% in room air. Blood gas analysis showed that the partial pressure of arterial oxygen was 58.2 torr, indicating respiratory failure. A pulmonary function test revealed restrictive ventilatory impairment, with a vital capacity (VC) of 2.11 L and a %VC of 57.1%. A diffuse lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 4.84 mL/min/mmHg and a %DLCO of 22.8% indicated diffusion disorder. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)  and TBLB samples  were obtained at this time. The BALF showed an increased lymphocyte ratio (34.4%), and pathological analysis of the TBLB specimen revealed an organizing pneumonia (OP)/nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) overlapping pattern. On the basis of the chest CT results, we suspected alectinib-induced DILD. However, we also considered respiratory infection or cancerous lymphangiopathy with cancer progression in the differential diagnoses. Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 9300/\u00b5L and a C-reactive protein level of 1.41 mg/dL. The BALF culture results were negative. The BALF was lymphocyte dominant, and no findings suggestive of cancer infiltration were observed in the TBLB specimen. On the basis of these results, we excluded the other conditions evaluated in the differential diagnosis. On the basis of the results of chest CT and bronchoscopic pathology, methylprednisolone was prescribed (1 g/day for 3 days). The patient then received oral prednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day), which was gradually reduced, and he was administered steroids for about 3 months. Third-line therapy with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) (100 mg/m2) was initiated after treatment with steroids. However, 3 months later, obstructive pneumonia associated with an increase in the size of the primary lesion was observed . Moreover, mild renal dysfunction persisted (creatinine, 1.63 mg/dL; eGFR, 35.45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Because of this complication and upon the patient\u2019s request for oral medication, lorlatinib (100 mg/day) was administered as fourth-line therapy. Treatment with antibiotics and lorlatinib reduced the lesion\u2019s shadow, and no recurrence of DILD was observed. Thirty-three months after the start of treatment, stable disease has been maintained, and lorlatinib has been continued (Figs. 1f, 4).",

The patient was administered medication, and symptoms were subsequently relieved. However, 12 days later, he experienced worsened symptoms and was transferred and admitted to the emergency department of the University of Miyazaki Hospital. MRI showed a mass of 70\u2009\u00d7\u200953\u2009\u00d7\u200957 mm in the left temporoparietal lobe (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). A solid element with slight hypointensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images along the dura mater was noted. Cystic changes were likely associated with the sanguineous fluid. A peritumoral band with hyperintensity on T2-weighted image was observed at the periphery of the lesion, suggesting an extra-axial lesion . A dural tail sign was also noted on the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image . The lesion appeared to be focally infiltrative to the brain surface, but no apparent connection to the ventricle was observed (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). Preoperative clinical diagnosis included hemangiopericytoma and ependymoma as differential diagnoses. Left parietotemporal craniotomy was performed. The tumor was an extra-axial mass and had partially infiltrated the dura mater and surface of the brain parenchyma in the left temporal lobe. Small pieces of tumor tissue were removed for intraoperative diagnosis. Under an emergency setting, near-total resection was achieved even if the lesion was in the eloquent area. The patient received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (total dose 54 Gy). However, within 1 year postsurgery, the tumor recurred and a second resection surgery was performed.

    "original_case": "A 43-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department with generalized itching, hives, and postural dizziness 1 hour after taking slow-release diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium SR) 100 mg tablet for headache. She has a history of migraine, for which she had been taking diclofenac sodium SR. Two months prior to this episode, she had developed itching of her palms after taking a diclofenac sodium SR tablet, which had resolved spontaneously. Apart from one incident of food allergy to northern pilchard, she had no food or drug allergy. She had no history of asthma. At the onset of her symptoms, the patient had taken 4 mg of chlorpheniramine for itching and continued to do household chores. Although the itching subsided after about 15 minutes, she felt lightheaded and weak on standing, which prompted her to lie down. Her postural symptoms resolved within 5 minutes of lying down. Over the next 20 minutes, she developed a dry cough with difficulty breathing. Her chest symptoms were relieved after taking two puffs of salbutamol from a metered-dose inhaler prescribed for her daughter. Subsequently, as the itching recurred with hives, she decided to seek medical care. The patient again felt dizzy and lightheaded on getting up and therefore remained supine while traveling to the hospital. On admission to the emergency department, she was conscious and rational, with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and supine blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 99% on room air. Examination revealed skin erythema, cutaneous edema, mild urticaria, and scattered rhonchi in both lungs. The rest of the system examination was normal. She was given intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg and chlorpheniramine 10 mg. Her vital parameters were monitored continuously. Intramuscular (IM) adrenaline and intravenous fluid were withheld because of high blood pressure. As the patient was tachycardic, nebulized adrenaline or salbutamol was not given. Her cutaneous and respiratory symptoms improved with treatment, but pulse rate and blood pressure remained persistently high. Forty minutes later, she felt the need to pass urine and was advised to use a bedpan. However, as the patient insisted on using the washroom, she was asked to sit up on the bed without standing immediately. Her dizziness and lightheadedness recurred within minutes of sitting up, and a dramatic drop in her blood pressure from 198/100 mmHg to 80/60 mmHg was observed. She was put back in the supine position, and her legs were elevated. Intramuscular adrenaline 0.5 mg was administered immediately, and a fluid bolus was given. As the blood pressure remained low (80/62 mmHg), IM adrenaline was repeated twice, 5 minutes apart, until the systolic blood pressure was more than 100 mmHg. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further observation. Her postural symptoms resolved completely after the administration of adrenaline. Her blood pressure fluctuated over the ensuing 24 hours with frequent high readings, and she remained tachycardic. Noteworthily, her blood pressure readings after treatment with adrenaline were not as high as the blood pressure at presentation. There were no hypotensive episodes. All her basic laboratory investigations, including full blood count (FBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and renal function tests were normal. Serum tryptase was not done as the clinical criteria for the diagnosis were met. Two days later, when she was discharged from the hospital, her blood pressure was 165/95 mmHg. On discharge, a diagnosis was made with a probable diagnosis of essential hypertension. She was prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector for emergency use and advised not to take diclofenac sodium or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Upon reviewing 2 weeks later, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed that she had previously undiagnosed hypertension. Interestingly, the highest recorded pretreatment systolic blood pressure (BP) was 170 mmHg, which was lower than her blood pressure on admission. All relevant imaging and hormonal investigations to identify a secondary cause for hypertension were found to be normal. She was commenced on telmisartan 40 mg and amlodipine 2.5 mg in the night and showed a good response to treatment. The timeline of events is summarized in Fig. 1. The cardiovascular observations within the first 6 hours of the hospital admission are depicted in Fig. 2.",

However, 3 weeks later, she started experiencing pain in her lower extremities (hyperalgesia), followed by tingling sensation and gradual weakness in all four limbs. Within a few days, she was also unable to urinate and defecate. Her spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed T2 hyperintensities along the cervicothoracic region , suggestive of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). The patient had no significant prior medical history. \n\nFig. 1 A Spine MRI scan before the first admission, showing T2 hyperintensity along the cervicothoracic region, corresponding with LETM; B brain MRI result during the first admission, revealing hyperintensity in T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in the posterior horn of the lateral ventricles; C repeat brain MRI scan obtained during the second admission, exhibiting no new lesion Full size image One day after her naso-oropharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for SARS CoV-2 was negative, the patient was transferred to our hospital.

His medical history included only an episode of pneumonia 5 years earlier, and he took no regular medications. He worked as a butcher, was a smoker with a history of 50 pack-years, and did not consume alcohol. There were no significant occupational or environmental exposures. He was born in China and migrated to Australia in his mid-30s. There was no family history of neurological diseases. He had received the scheduled age-appropriate vaccinations in China, not including the chickenpox or varicella vaccines. On examination on his presentation, he was afebrile and the rest of his observations were within normal limits (blood pressure 160/80 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 100% on room air). His speech was normal, and voice was not hoarse. Cranial nerves were intact, there was preserved motor and sensory function in all limbs, and he was normoreflexic throughout. Cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. His throat was not inflamed, with no obvious masses, goiter, or neck lymphadenopathy. He was able to swallow a small amount of water on sip testing, but appeared to have to force-swallow, and choked when trying to sip a larger amount.

The initial symptoms appeared 3 weeks prior to admission, consisting of fatigue, occasional headache, and loss of appetite. Meanwhile, 1 week before hospitalization, fever appeared up to 40 \u00b0C, recurring every 4\u20136 hours. He had previously been treated for a nasopharyngeal inflammation with antipyretics and antibiotics. However, the fever continued, and the illness progressed with vomiting and abdominal pain, fatigue, and refusal to eat. The day before admission at the intensive care unit, his family became concerned by a new onset of bilateral eye redness, swelling, redness of hands and feet, rash, irritability, and photophobia. At admission, he had fever of up to 40 \u00b0C, arterial hypotension with blood pressure (BP) of 70/40 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate (HR) of 130/min, tachypnea with a respiratory rate (RR) of 45/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%, paleness, and dehydration, with a chest capillary refill time (CRT) of 5 seconds. Signs of hyperinflammatory syndrome were also present, with mucocutaneous inflammation signs such as swollen and red eyelids, bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, oral mucosal lesions, dry lips, strawberry-red tongue, and oropharyngeal hyperemia. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Redness and swelling were also present on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (Figs. 1 and 2).\n\nFig. 1\nPalmar erythema on the first day of hospitalization\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nRedness and swelling from the upper surface to the sole of the foot\nFull size image\nThe child\u2019s mental status and level of consciousness were also altered. He was lethargic and irritable, with photophobia during the examination. His lungs were clear and had no murmurs or cardiac friction rub. The abdomen was soft without hepatosplenomegaly, but was painful during palpation. Based on a height of 120 cm and a weight of 34 kg, he had obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 23.6, placing his BMI for age at greater than the 99th percentile. There was a history of positive COVID-19 contact 3 weeks ago when his uncle had a brief febrile upper respiratory infection and was tested and confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Meanwhile, his asymptomatic father had a negative PCR test for SARS COV-2 but positive serology with a high immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to SARS COV-2 on the day of the child\u2019s admission. The child remained at home with his immediate family during this period but was not tested for SARS COV-2 infection. There was no personal or family history of allergic reactions, vasculitis, autoimmune disorders, cardiac disease, diabetes, or hereditary disease. This was the third hospitalization of the child; the first one at the age of 2 due to gastroenteritis; and the second one, at the age of 4, due to a urinary tract infection. Initial laboratory results revealed a high level of inflammatory markers, including a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 156.8 mg/l, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 100 mm/hour, procalcitonin (PCT) of 13.84 (), leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and lymphopenia (). Liver and renal functions were also altered, manifested by hypoalbuminemia (30.6 g/L), hypoproteinemia (60.3 g/L), hyperuricemia (602.77 umol/L), uremia (15.81 mmol/L), and an increased level of serum creatinine (114 umol/L) as a consequence of renal dysfunction (acute kidney injury), which resolved with hydration (). There was a mild elevation of cholesterol and significant elevation of triglycerides (5.29 mmol/L) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT, 79 U/L) with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) levels (). The capillary blood electrolytes (Na, K, Ca) were also altered, with hyponatremia (129 mmol/L), a low level of bicarbonates (19.7 mmol/L), a base excess (BE) of 4 mmol/L, and hypoxemia with capillary blood gas of pO2 of 63 mmHg and pCO2 of 29 mmHg (). A lumbar puncture was performed owing to fever, irritability, altered level of consciousness, and photophobia. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was slightly turbid, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 128/mm3 (80% mononuclear cells and 20% polymorphonuclear), CSF protein of 1.14 g/L (normal range 0.10\u20130.45 g/L) and CSF glucose of 3.84 mmol/L (simultaneous blood glucose level of 5.45 mmol/L). The bacterial culture of CSF was negative. The findings from the CSF examination were consistent with aseptic meningitis. Normal fundus findings were found on ophthalmoscopy examination. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was negative, while SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing was positive. D-dimer was high, at 464 ng/mL and 833 ng/ml by two measurements (reference range \u02c2 200), while the coagulation tests were within the normal range (). The urinalysis revealed proteinuria (30\u2013100 mg/dl), which was confirmed by 24-hour urine collection. Leukocyturia and occasionally bacteriuria were also present, but the urine culture was negative. Moreover, no other obvious microbial cause of inflammation was found, including two blood cultures for bacterial sepsis, three urine cultures, and nasopharyngeal and CSF cultures. \n\n Laboratory values and trends during hospital stay\nFull size table\n Complete blood cells count (CBC) and trends during hospital stay\nFull size table\n Capillary blood gases and electrolytes\nFull size table\nThe chest radiography showed bilateral minimal peripheral patchy opacities but no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax .\n\nFig. 3\nFrontal chest radiography shows bilateral minimal peripheral patchy opacities.

The initial symptoms appeared 3 weeks prior to admission, consisting of fatigue, occasional headache, and loss of appetite. Meanwhile, 1 week before hospitalization, fever appeared up to 40 \u00b0C, recurring every 4\u20136 hours. He had previously been treated for a nasopharyngeal inflammation with antipyretics and antibiotics. However, the fever continued, and the illness progressed with vomiting and abdominal pain, fatigue, and refusal to eat. The day before admission at the intensive care unit, his family became concerned by a new onset of bilateral eye redness, swelling, redness of hands and feet, rash, irritability, and photophobia. At admission, he had fever of up to 40 \u00b0C, arterial hypotension with blood pressure (BP) of 70/40 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate (HR) of 130/min, tachypnea with a respiratory rate (RR) of 45/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%, paleness, and dehydration, with a chest capillary refill time (CRT) of 5 seconds. Signs of hyperinflammatory syndrome were also present, with mucocutaneous inflammation signs such as swollen and red eyelids, bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, oral mucosal lesions, dry lips, strawberry-red tongue, and oropharyngeal hyperemia.

    "original_case": "With a clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition, a 7-year-old, Turkish male was referred to the Department of Oncology at Hacettepe University for the recurring tumor after local excision of the lesion over his nose. The lesion was a rapidly growing lesion, this time measuring 8 \u00d7 4 cm in size . Physical examination revealed that he also had hemorrhagic crusted plaques and nodules over both eyelids and upper lip, as well as multiple hypo- and hyperpigmented punctate lesions all over his body. Fig. 1 Clinical photograph showing a rapidly growing lesion on dorsum of nose and pigmented macules on sun-exposed regions of the body Full size image Perinatal and early postnatal histories were unremarkable. He had no symptoms before 2 years of age when hyperpigmented spots were first recognized. The parents were first cousins. There was no history of other family members having a similar disorder. There was no known disease in his two siblings, either. The child was regularly immunized. The developmental milestones were normal. Systemic examination, including neurological functions, was essentially normal. Starting at the age of 2 years, the patient had hyperpigmented spots all over his face and arms, more prominent on his forearm, and bilateral widespread hypopigmented areas over the thighs. This abnormal pigmentation progressively worsened on exposure to sunlight, particularly in overexposed areas. With these complaints, the patient received a clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition. When he was 2 years old, a crusted erythematous lesion appeared on the edge of his left eye, as well. Following facial lesion excision, the pathology result was found to be consistent with a tumor. After a year, lesions on one side of his nose and two other parts of his face also were excised and reported again as consistent with a tumor (4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 cm in nasal region, 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 cm in left zygomatic, 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 satellite lesion in maxilla). At the age of 6 years, the patient was admitted to our hospital for a rapidly growing nasal lesion (Figs. 2 and 3). Incisional biopsy was done from the lobulated giant mass that caused narrowing of the right nasal aperture with external pressure. Pathological examination revealed the tumor as being medium to well differentiated. The right submandibular and preauricular metastatic lymph nodes (LN) were noted during the postoperative period. Chemotherapy was started with reduced doses with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil owing to metastatic LN and unresectable primary tumor. Surgical excision could be performed after six cycles of chemotherapy, and the large mass of 9.5 cm in longest diameter was excised from the nose with positive surgical margin. After two more cycles, progressive disease was noted with enlarged submandibular LN and a new lesion on the right eyelid causing blurred vision. Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment was planned with concomitant radiotherapy (66 Gy to the primary nasal mass, 60 Gy to preauricular LN, and 54 Gy to bilateral neck). He received the antibody every 3 weeks for 4 months, and his vision was improved. However, after 4 months, the treatment had to be stopped owing to financial reasons. Control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed improvement in LN, and no new skin lesion was detected. He was followed up without any systemic chemotherapy, but local fluorouracil cream was used for new superficial lesions that appeared on the scalp, tongue, and right auricle.

Invasion of the mass into the nasal passage or ethmoid cells was not detected Full size image After 18 months of follow-up, relapse was observed on a new lesion on his nape. The excised lesion was diagnosed as recurrent tumor. The antibody was planned, but owing to refusal of financial approval of the antibody, another treatment was given for 5 months. Partial response was noted in periorbital lesions, but auricular lesions were stable. The antibody was approved and was given for 15 months. No new lesions or active complaints have been observed in the current situation, and complete remission has been achieved. Owing to the condition\u2019s genetic heterogeneity, WES was performed with Ion Proton next-generation sequencing platform, and the c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation of the gene was detected in the homozygous state. The variant was then validated by Sanger sequencing . This gene was associated with the genetic condition. This homozygous c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation is a mutation not yet reported in the ClinVar database. The parents of the patient were carriers (heterozygous) for the relevant mutation.

    "original_case": "The patient was a Japanese male in his 40s who had previously suffered renal cell carcinoma and undergone left nephrectomy. Smoking and family histories were both negative. He lived alone in a house surrounded by hills. He used the train for transportation, including taking the train station stairs to the second floor to buy the tickets. He was a private driver of a company car. On T + 3 days [T: day patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C)] in 2020, an employee at workplace was diagnosed with an infectious disease, and this was the occasion when our patient came in contact with an infected person. Present medical history The patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C) on day T in 2020, followed by development of dyspnea on day T + 4; on day T + 6, he decided to visit the emergency room of our hospital where he was checked but sent home the same day after receiving a PCR test. On day T + 8, he returned to the same hospital with worsening dyspnea and general malaise. Blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 3500/\u03bcL; lactose, dehydrogenase (LDH) 646 U/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 6.32 mg/dL; ferritin, 2291 ng/mL, and a positive PCR test for the infectious disease. He was admitted to our hospital. Plain chest X-ray on the same day showed extensive frost shadows in the upper and lower lung fields with bilateral peripheral predominance. Chest CT confirmed these findings, showing a broad range of ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening and bilateral peripheral dorsal base predominance . Respiratory function deteriorated rapidly after admission, with the patient requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation on day T + 9. He was transferred to another hospital after considering the potential need for ECMO. On day T + 13, he developed aspiration pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, with further worsening of ventilatory dysfunction, that progressed to bilateral dorsal atelectasis on day T + 14, leading to the initiation of ECMO. He was kept in prone position during the treatment. Following gradual improvement, ECMO was discontinued on day T + 22 as was mechanical ventilation 2 days later. At the last evaluation of the effects of rehabilitation therapy on day T + 29 during the previous hospitalization, the muscle strength was 2 for shoulder abduction, 3 for elbow flexion, 3 for wrist dorsiflexion, 2 for hip flexion, 3 for knee extension, and 3 for ankle dorsiflexion, based on manual muscle testing (MMT). Due to low levels of activities of daily living (ADL), he was transferred back to our hospital on day T + 30 for rehabilitation therapy. Fig. 1 A Plain radiograph of the chest (day T + 8). Note the extensive frost shadows in the upper and lower lung fields with bilateral peripheral predominance. B Computed tomography image of the chest (day T + 8). Note the broad range of ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening and bilateral peripheral dorsal base predominance. T Day patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C). Figure is taken from Kashiwabara et al. [5], with permission Full size image On first admission to our Rehabilitation Department he was given a clinical examination and underwent laboratory tests. These showed a height of 171 cm and body weight of 62 kg; full consciousness; no edema; body temperature, 36.8 \u00b0C; heart rate, 86 beats per minute; blood pressure, 114/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 19 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation (SpO2, 97% (on room air). Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.416, partial pressure CO2 (pCO2) 30.2 mmHg, and partial pressure O2 (pO2) 77.7 mmHg. Further tests included those for total protein (6.8 g/dL), albumin (2.9 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 26 mg/dL), creatinine (Cr; 1.32 mg/dL), creatinine clearance (CrCl; 59 mL/minute) (urine analysis at any time), and urine protein (\u00b1). Chest CT showed resolution of the shadows in the lower lobes bilaterally, with a band of infiltrating shadows remaining at the periphery of the upper lobes bilaterally . MMT showed hip flexion 3/3, knee extension 4/4, knee joint flexion 3/3, foot dorsiflexion 4/4, ankle plantar flexion 4/4, with no muscle weakness in both upper extremities. However, he complained of weakness, such as his cell phone feeling heavy. Cognitive function was normal, and there were no evident clinical abnormalities of the central nervous system, including olfactory or gustatory disturbances, and no neurological abnormalities other than lower limb muscle weakness. While supported, he was able to perform independently basic and orthostatic movements. He experienced a temporary decrease in SpO2 to 94% (room air) during the execution of orthostatic movements. The patient could stand for about 1 minute, although he required upper limb support during the task and was unable to hold the position for a long time (about 10 minutes). He used a walker and was able to walk independently for about 10 meters. He was frustrated and worried about social distancing and restriction of movement introduced during the pandemic. He also complained of compromised motivation during the inactivity. Fig. 2 Computed tomography image of the chest. A Day T + 30. Note the resolution of the shadows in the bilateral lower lobes, with a band of infiltrating shadows remaining at the periphery of the bilateral upper lobes. B Day T + 78. Note the resolution of the band of infiltrating shadows. Figure is taken from Kashiwabara et al. [5], with permission Full size image Clinical progress and rehabilitation therapy While the SpO2 on room air was within the normal range, the patient complained of marked muscle weakness, mainly in the lower part of the body, together with generalized weakness. Based on the medical history and the generalized and symmetrical muscle weakness reported during the previous hospitalization (provisionally diagnosed at that admission as ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) [6]), we first ruled out conditions associated with muscle weakness. Physical therapy was recommended based on the marked muscle weakness, but could not be provided in line with the hospital policy of withholding such therapy from infected patients until 2 weeks after a negative PCR test. During the 2-week quarantine period, no equipment (diagnostic or rehabilitation therapy) was taken into his hospital room. Instead, he was instructed during this 2-week period to exercise while in isolation, following a self-training program that focused on strengthening the muscles of the trunk, both upper and lower limbs, fingers, and expiratory muscles, including, among other exercises, stretching the trunk, exercising the shoulder girdle and neck, and deep breathing. The patient adhered to the program, which was designed to achieve independence in basic movements and gait, as well as to strengthen respiratory muscles. The self-exercise program included exercising three times a day, at 1000, 1300, and 1500 hours, for a total of about 30 minutes, three sets at a time, 6 days a week. The patient was not supervised during this exercise-in-isolation program, but was occasionally monitored by nurses or physical therapists. There was no drop in SpO2 during the exercising. However, the patient was not monitored with video cameras or remote recording while he remained in isolation. The exercise intensity was increased by the physical therapist after the sixth day. Following this program, the patient was able to walk unassisted by day T + 34 without a walker. On day T + 37, he was transferred to the general ward and provided with a new self-training program. The aim of this protocol was to improve walking endurance by strengthening trunk and lower limb muscles, such as standing up, standing on one leg, standing on the toes, and squatting. Although he spent most of the time in the hospital room, the patient was gradually introduced to light exercises, such as walking outside the room and inside the hospital. Despite his low endurance, he was able to stand without upper limb support and also on one leg for 10 seconds bilaterally. The measured walking distance while wearing a face mask was 383 m (). By day T + 39, his body weight had increased to 66.5 kg and spirometry values became normal (). He was able to do four to five squats by day T + 41, but still had difficulty climbing stairs. When 2 weeks had passed since the negative PCR test, according to the hospital rules at that time the patient was allowed to receive individual therapy (respiratory rehabilitation/physical therapy). In compliance with the standard rules, the patient wore a surgical mask and the therapist wore personal protective equipment. On day T + 49, we started the following individualized rehabilitation therapy, including physical and respiratory rehabilitation therapy, in addition to education on independent training, such as (1) range of motion joint exercises, (2) muscle strengthening exercises, (3) gait exercises, (4) stair climbing exercises, (5) endurance training, and (6) self-directed training, through supervised, non-equipment-based exercises. Endurance was still low, and he suffered from shortness of breath after light jogging for a very short distance. He was later able to go up and down the stairs independently without support, and accordingly was discharged on day T + 53. During the period between hospitalization day T + 30 and day T + 53, the patient was provided with a general diet (1900 kcal/day: 65\u201375 g protein, 44\u201361 g fat, 263\u2013311 g carbohydrate, and < 8 g salt), with protein accounting for 15-16% of total calorie intake. At the time of discharge, his body temperature was 36.5 \u00b0C; heart rate, 94 beats per minute; blood pressure, 106/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 14 breaths per minute; SpO2, 98% (on room air).  Results of various motor and respiratory function tests at 1 and 4 months after onset of the infectious disease Full size table On the first post-discharge outpatient visit, he was instructed to continue with the voluntary training program, with a subjective aerobic exercise intensity of \u201ceasy,\u201d resistance exercise intensity of 8\u201312 RM (Repetition Maximum), and with no restrictions on exercise type. He was also instructed to gradually increase the load with the recovery of physical strength. Based on his good general condition and renal function, the patient was encouraged to increase the intensity of exercise and consume a protein-rich diet after discharge, including natto (fermented soybeans) and chicken meat. A chest CT taken on day T + 78 showed resolution of the band of infiltrating shadows . Laboratory tests at this same time point showed total protein of 6.7 g/dL, albumin of 4.0 g/dL, BUN of 18 mg/dL, Cr of 1.36 mg/dL, CrCl of 61 mL/minute, and \u00b1 proteinuria. He returned to work on day T + 88 and continued to show improvement in physical fitness, with a body weight gain to 72 kg (75 kg before the infectious disease). However, hair loss was noted after day T + 100 , together with a transverse nail groove.  shows the changes in various parameters recorded at 1 and 4 months after the onset of the infectious disease (day T). Improvements were noted in respiratory function tests, the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and 6-minute walking test [7], with a decrease in the ECW/TBW ratio from 0.394 (day T + 52) to 0.389 (day T + 120), as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis using the In Body\u00ae (InBody Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) body composition analyzer, suggesting an increase in the number of somatic cells that make up muscles. In fact, the volume of the psoas muscle, as measured by CT, increased from 276 cm3 (day T + 41) to 316 cm3 (day T + 116) (Fig. 4 A, B). Respiratory and motor functions recovered with no complications.

Instead, he was instructed during this 2-week period to exercise while in isolation, following a self-training program that focused on strengthening the muscles of the trunk, both upper and lower limbs, fingers, and expiratory muscles, including, among other exercises, stretching the trunk, exercising the shoulder girdle and neck, and deep breathing. The patient adhered to the program, which was designed to achieve independence in basic movements and gait, as well as to strengthen respiratory muscles. The self-exercise program included exercising three times a day, at 1000, 1300, and 1500 hours, for a total of about 30 minutes, three sets at a time, 6 days a week. The patient was not supervised during this exercise-in-isolation program, but was occasionally monitored by nurses or physical therapists. There was no drop in SpO2 during the exercising. However, the patient was not monitored with video cameras or remote recording while he remained in isolation. The exercise intensity was increased by the physical therapist after the sixth day. Following this program, the patient was able to walk unassisted by day T + 34 without a walker. On day T + 37, he was transferred to the general ward and provided with a new self-training program. The aim of this protocol was to improve walking endurance by strengthening trunk and lower limb muscles, such as standing up, standing on one leg, standing on the toes, and squatting. Although he spent most of the time in the hospital room, the patient was gradually introduced to light exercises, such as walking outside the room and inside the hospital. Despite his low endurance, he was able to stand without upper limb support and also on one leg for 10 seconds bilaterally. The measured walking distance while wearing a face mask was 383 m (). By day T + 39, his body weight had increased to 66.5 kg and spirometry values became normal (). He was able to do four to five squats by day T + 41, but still had difficulty climbing stairs. When 2 weeks had passed since the negative PCR test, according to the hospital rules at that time the patient was allowed to receive individual therapy (respiratory rehabilitation/physical therapy). In compliance with the standard rules, the patient wore a surgical mask and the therapist wore personal protective equipment. On day T + 49, we started the following individualized rehabilitation therapy, including physical and respiratory rehabilitation therapy, in addition to education on independent training, such as (1) range of motion joint exercises, (2) muscle strengthening exercises, (3) gait exercises, (4) stair climbing exercises, (5) endurance training, and (6) self-directed training, through supervised, non-equipment-based exercises. Endurance was still low, and he suffered from shortness of breath after light jogging for a very short distance. He was later able to go up and down the stairs independently without support, and accordingly was discharged on day T + 53. During the period between hospitalization day T + 30 and day T + 53, the patient was provided with a general diet (1900 kcal/day: 65\u201375 g protein, 44\u201361 g fat, 263\u2013311 g carbohydrate, and < 8 g salt), with protein accounting for 15-16% of total calorie intake. At the time of discharge, his body temperature was 36.5 \u00b0C; heart rate, 94 beats per minute; blood pressure, 106/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 14 breaths per minute; SpO2, 98% (on room air).  Results of various motor and respiratory function tests at 1 and 4 months after onset of the infectious disease Full size table On the first post-discharge outpatient visit, he was instructed to continue with the voluntary training program, with a subjective aerobic exercise intensity of \u201ceasy,\u201d resistance exercise intensity of 8\u201312 RM (Repetition Maximum), and with no restrictions on exercise type. He was also instructed to gradually increase the load with the recovery of physical strength. Based on his good general condition and renal function, the patient was encouraged to increase the intensity of exercise and consume a protein-rich diet after discharge, including natto (fermented soybeans) and chicken meat. A chest CT taken on day T + 78 showed resolution of the band of infiltrating shadows . Laboratory tests at this same time point showed total protein of 6.7 g/dL, albumin of 4.0 g/dL, BUN of 18 mg/dL, Cr of 1.36 mg/dL, CrCl of 61 mL/minute, and \u00b1 proteinuria. He returned to work on day T + 88 and continued to show improvement in physical fitness, with a body weight gain to 72 kg (75 kg before the infectious disease). However, hair loss was noted after day T + 100 , together with a transverse nail groove.  shows the changes in various parameters recorded at 1 and 4 months after the onset of the infectious disease (day T). Improvements were noted in respiratory function tests, the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and 6-minute walking test [7], with a decrease in the ECW/TBW ratio from 0.394 (day T + 52) to 0.389 (day T + 120), as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis using the In Body\u00ae (InBody Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) body composition analyzer, suggesting an increase in the number of somatic cells that make up muscles. In fact, the volume of the psoas muscle, as measured by CT, increased from 276 cm3 (day T + 41) to 316 cm3 (day T + 116) (Fig. 4 A, B). Respiratory and motor functions recovered with no complications.

Despite high tumor PD-L1 expression, the decision was made to initiate combination chemotherapy plus ICI rather than ICI monotherapy due to the patient\u2019s never-smoking status. The patient received two cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab. He tolerated treatment well, with no high-grade toxicities.

Abdominal magnetic resonance confirmed the dimensional findings and excluded biliary tree dilatation. In order to explain the cause of abnormal liver tests and to exclude preexisting liver disease, a liver biopsy was performed. It showed massive sinusoidal and portal infiltration by leukemic cells (Fig. 5 a, b). Many eosinophils were also observed. Leukemic cells were immunoreactive for MPO , CD33 , HLA-DR , CD38 , and, in part, for CD34 . Virtually all blasts expressed Ki67 .

Three months later, he underwent the same surgical procedure using the same retrobulbar anesthesia in his right eye. Preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.5 (\u2212 1.25 sphere \u2212 0.75 cylinder at axis 50) in the right eye and 0.75 (\u2212 3.25 sphere \u2212 1.75 cylinder at axis 95) in the left eye. Both eyes were pseudophakic at the time of macular pucker diagnosis and underwent the same procedure 3 months apart. The patient underwent surgery under monitored anesthesia care with a retrobulbar block using a 25-gauge (G), 38-mm Atkinson needle containing 5 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 2% Xylocaine containing adrenaline (1:200,000) and Bupivacaine 5 mg/ml. Both eyes were operated by the same experienced surgeon. In both cases the retrobulbar anesthesia was administered by the same experienced ophthalmologist and the same drug combination was used. \n\nPreoperative review of the patient\u2019s medical history showed that the patient was under observation due to a myocardial infarction that he had about 5 years previously. He also was under rheumatological observation for ankylosing spondylitis. His treatment at the time of surgery consisted of acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg once daily and atorvastatin 40 mg once daily. No other health problems were reported. The patient denied any allergies. The patient\u2019s social history was negative for smoking, alcohol abuse, recreational drug use, and travel abroad. The patient was a doctor who had been worked in the hospital as a clinician for about 30 years. His mother suffered from migraines and died of a heart attack at the age of 70 years. At the age of 69 years, his maternal grandfather suffered a stroke. The patient did not know anything about his father\u2019s side of the family, but there was no other family history of stroke or vascular illness. \n\nThree 25G trocars were placed through a self-sealing sclerotomy construction. Central and peripheral pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed. Preexisting posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) induction was verified. Brilliant Blue G containing dye (ILM-BLUE\u00ae; D.O.R.C., Zuidland, the Netherlands) aided visualization of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and allowed for both ERM and ILM peeling up to the vascular arcades. Peripheral indentation allowed for retinal lesion verification. No breaks were found. BSS intraocular irrigating solution was left in the vitreous chamber. The sclerotomies were self-sealing and no sutures were needed. At the conclusion of the procedure, about 0.2 mg of subconjunctival gentamycin was administered. No gas bubble was instilled, there were no episodes of hypotension during the surgery, and postoperatively the patient did not sleep in the prone position. \n\nThe left eye had a regular postoperative course .

As soon as she tried to examine the animal, it started biting her, biting digit IV of the right hand and digit II of the left hand. After the wounds had been cleaned and dressed, she was started the same day on antibiotic therapy consisting of cefuroxime 500 mg orally twice a day. Tetanus vaccination status was also checked. On day 6 after the bite, the patient presented at the hospital\u2019s emergency room showing the following symptoms: general malaise, aching head and body, fever, chill, and a swollen right elbow. She did not report having suffered from nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or noise. The clinical examination showed a minor bite on digit IV of the right hand, located near the middle phalanx, slightly reddened, yet without clear inflammatory signs. There was no pain to pressure, no movement restriction, nor any sensory deficit. There were also visible signs of lymphadenitis at the ulnar side of the right elbow. The peripheral sensitivity as well as movement skills and blood flow were intact. At the index finger of the left hand, another minor bite without any local or proximal signs of inflammation was recorded. The physical examination did not reveal anything unusual. The vital parameters were stable, with the exception of a negligible sinus tachycardia. No signs of meningism were found. Laboratory tests showed an increase in the C-reactive protein (CRP) up to 28.6 mg/L (reference < 5 mg/L), but no leukocytosis. The test for procalcitonin (indicating bacterial inflammation) was negative. Sampled cerebrospinal fluid and urine were also negative in standard laboratory tests. X-rays of the thorax and of digit IV of the right hand and a native computed tomography (CT) brain scan did not show any pathological outcomes. Real-time PCR assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A and B were negative. Starting on day 7, the medical treatment also comprised combination therapy with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam, 2 g/1 g) 3 times a day. However, the patient\u2019s condition did not improve and fever rose up to 39.2 \u00b0C and persisted until day 12. Blood culture remained negative, even at 14 days after inoculation. CRP increased up to 185 mg/L on day 12. As a consequence, treatment was intensified by commencing combination antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g/0.5 g) on day 11. Following initiation of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, the CRP fell to 74 mg/L (day 14) and there was a mild persisting leukocytosis (12.14 \u00d7 10^3). In parallel, the wound on the patient\u2019s right hand developed an ulcer-like lesion showing swollen reddened edges and a central incrustation . The lymphadenitis of the right elbow persisted. It was at this stage that a specific infectious disease was suspected as a possible diagnosis for the first time. Following a phone call with the reference laboratory for the suspected infectious disease on day 14, the decision was made to send a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient\u2019s right hand (A-1825/1) to the reference laboratory for microbiological examination. In addition, a serum sample (A-1825/2) was taken for antibody detection (day 14). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide of the suspected pathogen Igpoly, immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM were borderline. Fig. 1 Picture of the right hand of the patient at day 14 after the squirrel bite on the digit IV. After presentation of the ulcerous lesion and the local lymphadenitis of the right elbow in combination with the non-effective antibiotic treatment using three different antibiotics over 2 weeks, the suspicion of a specific infectious disease was expressed. To isolate living bacteria and extract DNA, the wound swab was suspended in 900 \u00b5L double-distilled water, and a 450-\u00b5L of the suspension was centrifuged. The resulting pellet was used for genomic desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A real-time PCR based on specific primers confirmed the presence of the suspected pathogen DNA in the wound swab sample. Subspecies was identified by block PCR targeting the region of difference 1 (RD1) according to protocols described by Broekhuijsen et al. For culture, 50 \u00b5L of the swab suspension was inoculated in 10 mL medium T and streaked onto MTKH, as well as onto chocolate agar plates and Neisseria selective medium plus (both Oxoid Germany GmbH, Wesel, Germany). The liquid medium and the agar plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Bacterial growth typical for the suspected pathogen could be observed on MTKH on day 3 of culture and on the chocolate and Neisseria agar plates on day 4. The patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid did not test positive for the suspected pathogen. Minimal inhibitory concentration testing according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m100/) guidelines for the suspected pathogen demonstrated an in vitro sensitivity to all antibiotics recommended for treatment of the specific infectious disease. The patient\u2019s antibiotic treatment applied until that stage turned out to be inadequate. In a sequencing study (MiSeq sequencer [Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA], see for details) and the phylogenetic analysis (Geneious prime [Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand], Mauve alignment, followed by neighbor-joining clustering, see for details), the DNA from the strain isolated from the patient\u2019s wound swab was shown to belong to a specific biovar and clade . Fig. 2 Phylogenetic relationship of the suspected pathogen in a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient\u2019s right hand (A-1825/1) (red, in bold) to isolates from various regions. Strains belonging to a specific major clade are indicated in blue. For each genome sequence, the year of sampling, the host organism, sampling spot (German federal states), and the known final subclade are given.

Patient A was a 58-year-old Filipina woman; patient B was a 62-year-old Korean woman; and patient C was a 57-year-old Vietnamese woman. Botulinum toxin was administered to treat the blepharospasm, and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) was administered to treat the blepharoptosis. These cases were particularly very intriguing, as we observed in Patients A and B that oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) increased the effects of botulinum toxin and resulted in a greater reduction of blepharospasm. In Patient C, we observed the initial effects of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) after 4 days and reported the preliminary results. Each patient was given the option to complete a survey that assessed the efficacy of botulinum toxin alone and the efficacy of both botulinum toxin and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) in reducing blepharospasm. Furthermore, the survey asked patients about their perceived stress during the past month. According to the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire, a score of 0-13 indicates low levels of psychological stress, a score of 14-26 indicates moderate stress, and a score of 27-40 indicates high stress.\n\nPatient A\u2019s past medical history included hypertension and temporomandibular joint disorder. Her ocular history included blepharospasm, upper eyelid ptosis, upper lid dermatochalasis, and dry eye syndrome. She had been using brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution (0.15%), carvedilol 6.25 mg oral tablet, desvenlafaxine succinate 25 mg oral tablet, lorazepam 0.5 mg oral tablet, losartan potassium 25 mg oral tablet, and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). Silicone punctal plugs had been inserted to treat her dry eye on 20 October 2016. She had been receiving botulinum toxin treatment since 2019.

The patient\u2019s history was unremarkable, except for mild arterial hypertension well treated with calcium channel blockers and diabetes. There were no hypertensive crises in her anamnesis. One month ago, she complained of dyspnea, fever, and chest pain. Given the presentation during the coronavirus pandemic, a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed  in line with the diagnostic pathway for COVID-19, which incidentally showed a retroperitoneal necrotizing mass. \n\nFig. 1 Computed tomography (CT) scan in pulmonary (A) and mediastinal (B) windows revealing ground-glass opacities related to COVID-19 infection and an incidental retroperitoneal mass (white arrow). \n\nFull size image Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed  and revealed an inhomogeneous, encapsulated, partially and vividly contrast-enhancing tumor, with a diameter of 16 \u00d7 12 cm.

For the colony-forming assay (CFA), the epithelial cells were seeded at 3000\u20135000 cells/60-mm dish; the mucosal epithelial sheets were then examined for quality and safety (Table\n1\n), including by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Samples were submitted for sterility tests including bacterial culture, fungal culture and endotoxin assay at the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital.\n The criteria for the safety test of the epithelial sheet\nFull size table\nTransplantation\nThe mucosal sheet was transferred in a close-system box kept at 20\u00a0\u00b0C to the operating room. The cell sheet was harvested on a ring of PVDF membrane (outer diameter: 25 mm; inner diameter: 15 mm). The transplantation of the cultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheet was performed at 20\u00b0C with the patient under general anesthesia. The first step was the excision of conjunctiva and fibrous tissue on the cornea, namely symblepharon lysis, prior to the actual transplant. Before and after surgery, the subjects received topical antibiotic every 2 hours, and topical corticosteroid 4 times daily. Intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g) was given every 12 hours for 3 days, then oral antibiotic for the next 5 days. Intravenous solumedrol (125 mg) was given every 12 hours for the first day and once daily for 2 days, and oral prednisolone (25 mg) was given twice daily for 2\u20134 weeks. The subjects wore protective contact lenses for 1 year following surgery. The symptoms, clinical findings of inflammation, and the accompanying images were recorded in a dedicated hard disk and graded for severity at the follow-up periods:  2 and 4 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months. The main outcome included corneal epithelial defect (0\u2013100%) and conjunctivalization on the cornea (25\u2013100%) within 1 year (graded from 0\u20135, with 0 = bad and 5 = excellent). The secondary outcome included visual acuity, corneal opacity, corneal vascularization, and complications.

The mucosal tissue was soaked in 10% betadine in distilled water (1:8 dilution) for 10 min, then rinsed with 0.5% levofloxacin before being transported in 30 mL FDM (DMEM, 10% FBS, 0.125 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B, 100 IU/mL penicillin G, 100 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin) in a sterilized box to the tissue culture facility. The dissected tissue was exposed to 1000 PU/mL dispase to separate the mucosal epithelial layer from the subcutaneous layer. The epithelial layer was digested with 0.25% trypsin EDTA to segregate epithelial cells. The isolated epithelial cells were seeded onto the irradiated feeder cells at a density of 2\u20133 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells/35-mm dish and maintained in 2\u00a0mL KCM medium with epidermal growth factor at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nfor 12\u201314 days before the transplant. For the colony-forming assay (CFA), the epithelial cells were seeded at 3000\u20135000 cells/60-mm dish; the mucosal epithelial sheets were then examined for quality and safety (Table\n1\n), including by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Samples were submitted for sterility tests including bacterial culture, fungal culture and endotoxin assay at the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital.\n The criteria for the safety test of the epithelial sheet\nFull size table\nTransplantation\nThe mucosal sheet was transferred in a close-system box kept at 20\u00a0\u00b0C to the operating room. The cell sheet was harvested on a ring of PVDF membrane (outer diameter: 25 mm; inner diameter: 15 mm). The transplantation of the cultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheet was performed at 20\u00b0C with the patient under general anesthesia. The first step was the excision of conjunctiva and fibrous tissue on the cornea, namely symblepharon lysis, prior to the actual transplant. Before and after surgery, the subjects received topical antibiotic every 2 hours, and topical corticosteroid 4 times daily. Intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g) was given every 12 hours for 3 days, then oral antibiotic for the next 5 days. Intravenous solumedrol (125 mg) was given every 12 hours for the first day and once daily for 2 days, and oral prednisolone (25 mg) was given twice daily for 2\u20134 weeks. The subjects wore protective contact lenses for 1 year following surgery. The symptoms, clinical findings of inflammation, and the accompanying images were recorded in a dedicated hard disk and graded for severity at the follow-up periods:  2 and 4 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months. The main outcome included corneal epithelial defect (0\u2013100%) and conjunctivalization on the cornea (25\u2013100%) within 1 year (graded from 0\u20135, with 0 = bad and 5 = excellent). The secondary outcome included visual acuity, corneal opacity, corneal vascularization, and complications. Only the investigators could access the collected data.\nStatistical analysis\nThe results are shown as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean of at least triplicate determinants.

She was a multi-para woman (Gravida: 3, Para: 2, Living: 2, Abortion: 0) with a gestational age of 30 weeks. She did not report any prenatal complications and had received corticosteroid therapy 2 days prior to hospital admission. Upon presentation, magnesium sulfate was immediately administered but she was transferred to the operation room for repeat Cesarean section due to progressive cervical dilation. A preterm male newborn with a first-minute Apgar score of 7 and birth weight of 1190 g was born. Physical examination after birth showed a notable frontal bossing, acrocyanosis, and diffuse head, neck, hand, and leg ecchymosis. Anterior and posterior fontanelles were normal. No congenital anomaly or abdominal organomegaly was observed. Peripheral pulses were palpable and heart sounds were normal without any abnormal sounds. His reflexes were normal, but limb movements were hypotonic. Due to an increase in his respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) score from 4 to 7 and signs of respiratory distress (inter- and subcostal retraction, grunting, and decreased breathing sounds), resuscitation measures were initiated. He was then given nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the operation room that was subsequently switched to mechanical ventilation in the NICU. Intratracheal surfactant and intravenous antibiotic therapy were also initiated in the NICU. Under mechanical ventilation with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) setup, his O2 saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate improved to > 94%, 70/35 mmHg, and 160 beats per minute, respectively. On day 3 post-NICU admission, a PICC line (Premicath; 1Fr/28 G; VYGON, \u00c9couen, France; Code 1261.080) was also inserted from the auxiliary vein of the right upper extremity for intravenous therapy, delivery of medications, and parenteral nutrition. A chest X-ray showed that the tip of the PICC line was in the appropriate place in the superior vena cava (SVC) . Mechanical ventilation was discontinued 72 h post-NICU admission because of improved respiratory condition and normal automatic breathing. After extubation, low-flow oxygen therapy was continued and low-volume feeding was initiated based on his tolerance. His weight gain was acceptable and the clinical situation improved, including a gradual increase in the feeding volume and respiratory support. On day 10 post-NICU admission, he suddenly developed hypotonia, apnea, hypoxia, and bradycardia. He was gasping, had hypotension, and there was an absence of peripheral pulses. In the first minutes after the alarm signs, resuscitation was initiated and ventilation support provided, together with administration of inotropic drugs (1\u20133 minutes). Despite the high-frequency setup of the mechanical ventilator, the endotracheal tube was checked for displacement or obstruction due to his persistent critical condition (hypotension and shortness of breath). Pneumothorax and equipment failure were also ruled out. Several medical measures were initiated (approximately at minutes 3\u20134), including nothing by mouth (NPO), high-dose antibiotic therapy, emergency echocardiography, brain ultrasound, arterial and venous blood sampling, blood cell count, and arterial blood gas analysis.

The ejection fraction value was 40%, and there was no evidence of atrial septal defect (ASD), pleural effusion, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A peripheral venous catheter was inserted, and the PICC was removed at the same time.

The aspirated fluid was sent to the laboratory for tests, with the results showing severe acidosis (pH 6.80) and hyperglycemia (). To improve the hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, the patient was hydrated with low glucose solution and bicarbonate was initiated. Respiratory support was continued and antibiotics covering Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria were administered. Brain sonography was also performed, which was normal.

The injection regimen of the patient consisted of multiple insulin injections day: regular insulin, 10 U before breakfast and dinner, and 6 U before lunch; NPH insulin, 25 U in the morning and 10 U at night). Her dose had been adjusted at her last visit to her endocrinologist 3 months previously, but she has had several severe hypoglycemic attacks during the last 4 weeks. The patient\u2019s lifestyle had also changed in the last 6 months, as she had begun routine gym exercise to manage her insulin needs and glycemic control. \n\nShe was examined by a neurologist in the morning for her focal neurological symptoms, and the examination revealed no deficits. Her medical history was also concerning for hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), and she was recommended to have this condition evaluated as outpatient. To avoid recurrent hypoglycemia, further laboratory tests and a follow-up evaluation with an endocrinologist were recommended, as well a switch from human insulins to analog insulins.",

The newborn\u2019s birth weight was 3700 g with an Apgar score of 9. His mother had no history of blood transfusion. This was her second pregnancy; her first child was a healthy 7-year-old girl. Routine prenatal examination for irregular antibodies had never been performed during her second pregnancy. The condition of the baby stabilized, and there were no findings of fetal distress. Four hours after birth, the baby was found to have obvious jaundice and transcutaneous bilirubin test reached a level of 17 mg/dl in the sixth hospital of the Baoji area. Then he was immediately sent to the neonatal intensive care unit of our hospital for further evaluation and monitoring, and the transcutaneous bilirubin level was 16.5 mg/dl on admission and first treated with intensive phototherapy for 16 hours. Laboratory results were as follows (23 hours after birth): red blood cell (RBC) 3.3 \u00d7 10^12 cells/L, white blood cell count 15.73 \u00d7 10^9 cells/L, hemoglobin 12.9 g/L, hematocrit 36%, platelet count 223 \u00d7 10^9/L; liver function test showed total bilirubin 13.3 mg/dl, and unconjugated bilirubin 12.6 mg/dl. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 63.5 mg/L, procalcitonin was 6.2 ng/ml, and interleukin-6 was 299.8 pg/ml. The following tests were all negative: blood culture, urinalysis, and stool (microscopic examination), cerebrospinal fluid routine, cerebrospinal fluid culture and biochemistry, tests for blood cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and other pathogens, as well as tests for arcuate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). The newborn and his mother were typed as blood group A, RhD+. The subtypes of Rh blood group were classified C, c, D, E, and e. Free test and diffusion test were negative. The neonate\u2019s red cells reacted positively (1+) in the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) including (IgG + C3d) polyclonal antibody; however, the anti-IgG test had a positive result, while anti-C3d test was negative. The irregular antibodies of the mother by microcolumn gel technology combined with anti-human globulin (IgG + C3d) were positive (IgG 1+, C3d\u2212). Because the mother did not receive blood transfusion and gamma globulin, we speculated that the anti-IgG might be against a rare blood group system. No antibodies against red blood group system were identified in tests using commercial antibody screening blood cell (Rh-hr, Kidd, MNSs, Duffy, Lewis, P). Anti-Dia was finally identified in the neonate\u2019s serum from tests with a commercial panel of red blood cells (spectrum cells including Rh-hr, Kidd, MNSs, Duffy, Diego, Kell, Lewis, P, DO, Yt) from the Shanghai Blood Biotechnology Company, China. To confirm the anti-Dia, blood samples of the newborn and his parents were sent to Shanghai Blood Center and further performed using a monoclonal anti-Dia and monoclonal anti-Dib standard serum, respectively. Thus, father and child were positive for Dia antigen, while mother was negative for Dia antigen. Dib antigen was negative for all of them.",

Laboratory results were as follows (23 hours after birth): red blood cell (RBC) 3.3 \u00d7 10^12 cells/L, white blood cell count 15.73 \u00d7 10^9 cells/L, hemoglobin 12.9 g/L, hematocrit 36%, platelet count 223 \u00d7 10^9/L; liver function test showed total bilirubin 13.3 mg/dl, and unconjugated bilirubin 12.6 mg/dl. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 63.5 mg/L, procalcitonin was 6.2 ng/ml, and interleukin-6 was 299.8 pg/ml. The following tests were all negative: blood culture, urinalysis, and stool (microscopic examination), cerebrospinal fluid routine, cerebrospinal fluid culture and biochemistry, tests for blood cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and other pathogens, as well as tests for arcuate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). The newborn and his mother were typed as blood group A, RhD+. The subtypes of Rh blood group were classified C, c, D, E, and e. Free test and diffusion test were negative. The neonate\u2019s red cells reacted positively (1+) in the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) including (IgG + C3d) polyclonal antibody; however, the anti-IgG test had a positive result, while anti-C3d test was negative. The irregular antibodies of the mother by microcolumn gel technology combined with anti-human globulin (IgG + C3d) were positive (IgG 1+, C3d\u2212). Because the mother did not receive blood transfusion and gamma globulin, we speculated that the anti-IgG might be against a rare blood group system. No antibodies against red blood group system were identified in tests using commercial antibody screening blood cell (Rh-hr, Kidd, MNSs, Duffy, Lewis, P). Anti-Dia was finally identified in the neonate\u2019s serum from tests with a commercial panel of red blood cells (spectrum cells including Rh-hr, Kidd, MNSs, Duffy, Diego, Kell, Lewis, P, DO, Yt) from the Shanghai Blood Biotechnology Company, China. To confirm the anti-Dia, blood samples of the newborn and his parents were sent to Shanghai Blood Center and further performed using a monoclonal anti-Dia and monoclonal anti-Dib standard serum, respectively. Thus, father and child were positive for Dia antigen, while mother was negative for Dia antigen. Dib antigen was negative for all of them.",

She removed her IV and left the hospital before being formally discharged, but the family brought her to our hospital with a report of paranoia and believing people outside her home were trying to kill her. Her last known ethanol consumption was 4 days prior, and alcohol, BNZs, and barbiturates were not detected in her serum or urine. She reported at least five \u201cheavy pours\u201d of vodka every day, and had consumed this amount for a few years. Examination was significant for tachycardia (127\u2013132 beats per minute), high blood pressure (ranging from 143 to 149/102 to 103 mmHg), and mild tenderness to palpation to bilateral upper abdominal quadrants. She was calm, fully oriented, and with organized thought process, but endorsed paranoia regarding family members being out to get her and hearing voices outside her head talking about her.

    "original_case": "Patient #1  \nThe first patient is a 37-year-old Caucasian man who had been relatively healthy until he presented with severe fatigue and muscle ache that persisted for several months. He visited his primary care doctor, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed a high leukocyte count and the presence of peripheral blasts. When he was sent to an emergency room, his total white blood cell (WBC) count was recorded at 20.5 k/mm3, hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL, and the platelet count was 146 k/mm3. He underwent a bone marrow biopsy that revealed hypercellular marrow. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis was positive for del 11q23 (KMT2A), and rearrangement of 14q32 (IGH). BCR-ABL minor fusion transcript (p190) was detected in a qualitative test, but it was not detected in a quantitative test. The discrepancy was due to a very low level of BCR-ABL fusion in the specimen. Hence the mutation was unlikely a pathogenic driver. Fortunately, there was no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.  \nHis father was a marine, and their family moved to Camp Lejeune in April 1985. The patient was 20 months old when they moved there, and they lived in Tarawa Terrace until 1992. When he grew up, he served in the Marine Corps himself from 2003 to 2008. After discharge, the patient had different jobs, but he had no known occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. The patient and his family were made aware of the water contamination problem at Camp Lejeune when they received a letter from the US Navy in 2012. He never smoked and does not drink alcohol. He developed anxiety after the diagnosis but had no other comorbidities. There is no family history of malignancy to his knowledge. He has one brother, who was in utero when the family moved to Camp Lejeune, and his brother has not been diagnosed with any cancer so far.  \nThe patient was started on the Linker regimen. Following completion of induction chemotherapy (cycle 1A), a bone marrow biopsy was normocellular, with mature tri-lineage hematopoiesis. Repeat next-generation sequencing (NGS) was negative for any genetic mutation, indicating no measurable residual disease (MRD). The patient received cycles 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B of the Linker regimen, and then underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. He tolerated the procedure well.  \n\nPatient #2  \nThe second patient is a Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with multiple different types of cancer. He was first diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma at the age of 68 after presenting with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4.5 ng/mL. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a 1 cm nodule in the left lobe was positive for clinical-stage T2aN0 prostate adenocarcinoma. The Gleason score was 3 + 4, and the tumor involved 10% of the biopsy specimen. He underwent brachytherapy with the implantation of iodine-125 seeds. And, at age 74, he was diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma. A large ascending colon mass was found on a computed tomography (CT) scan during a workup for unexplained anemia. Subsequently, he underwent a right hemicolectomy for a high-grade, poorly differentiated pT4bN0 tumor. After surgery, he received adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy and has remained colon cancer-free per radiographic imaging and endoscopic surveillance. He was also diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 75. A series of CT scans detected a slowly but progressively enlarging mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. When it was brought up as a worrisome finding, the size of the tumor was 10 \u00d7 13 mm. He declined to undergo biopsy due to the high risks of the procedure, opting instead for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This study confirmed the presence of the right upper lobe pulmonary nodule with a measured standardized uptake value (SUV) of 8.8. After an interdisciplinary discussion, the consensus decision was to obliterate the mass with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The patient received a protracted course of 12 fractions of radiation at \u00d7400 cGy per dose, and there has been no evidence of recurrent disease since then.  \nAt the age of 78, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He had intermittent thrombocytopenia for several years, but workup for the lymphoproliferative disease was negative. However, a recent bone marrow biopsy was positive for kappa monotypic B cells, consistent with CLL. Then, the patient developed Evans syndrome with progressive thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. He was initially treated with rituximab plus prednisone. However, without improvement in the cell counts, the treatment was subsequently switched to a single-agent ibrutinib. After the switch of therapy, his blood counts have stabilized.  \nThis patient was stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1962 to 1987 as an enlisted marine. He lived in a trailer park in Camp Johnson, formerly named Camp Knox. He has been an occasional pipe smoker for about 20 years but had no other exposure to toxic chemicals except for the contaminated water supply. He does not drink alcohol. Although an association is less clear, he and his wife had difficulty conceiving additional children for 10 years after the birth of their first child. His other comorbidities include coronary artery disease requiring stent placement, type 2 diabetes, and depression. There is no one else in the family who had cancer as far as he knows.  \n\nPatient #3  \nThe third patient is a 77-year-old Caucasian man who has a history of recurrent nasal papilloma and multiple skin cancers. He developed a severe de novo allergy while living at Camp Lejeune. Since then, he has undergone multiple surgical resections for recurrent inverted nasal papilloma. In addition, he has received nitrous oxide cryotherapy and repeated surgical resections for multiple and recurrent basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Most recently, at the age of 77, he was diagnosed with melanoma of the right supraclavicular chest for which he underwent wide local excision with clear margins.  \nHe lived at Camp Lejeune while serving as an active-duty marine for 2 years from 1967 to 1968. During the first year, he lived in a barrack in the division headquarters, located at Hadnot Point. During his second year, he and his wife moved to a married housing unit in Tarawa Terrace. Following his discharge from the service, he worked in a suture and contact lens manufacturing factory at Johnson & Johnson, but he denied any occupational exposure to chemicals or toxins. He is a never-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. His mother, who was a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer, but no one else in his family has had cancer. Timelines of events for each patient are summarized in .  \n Timeline of events",

Fortunately, there was no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.  \nHis father was a marine, and their family moved to Camp Lejeune in April 1985. The patient was 20 months old when they moved there, and they lived in Tarawa Terrace until 1992. When he grew up, he served in the Marine Corps himself from 2003 to 2008. After discharge, the patient had different jobs, but he had no known occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. The patient and his family were made aware of the water contamination problem at Camp Lejeune when they received a letter from the US Navy in 2012. He never smoked and does not drink alcohol. He developed anxiety after the diagnosis but had no other comorbidities. There is no family history of malignancy to his knowledge. He has one brother, who was in utero when the family moved to Camp Lejeune, and his brother has not been diagnosed with any cancer so far.  \nThe patient was started on the Linker regimen. Following completion of induction chemotherapy (cycle 1A), a bone marrow biopsy was normocellular, with mature tri-lineage hematopoiesis. Repeat next-generation sequencing (NGS) was negative for any genetic mutation, indicating no measurable residual disease (MRD). The patient received cycles 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B of the Linker regimen, and then underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. He tolerated the procedure well.  \n\nPatient #2  \nThe second patient is a Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with multiple different types of cancer. He was first diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma at the age of 68 after presenting with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4.5 ng/mL. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a 1 cm nodule in the left lobe was positive for clinical-stage T2aN0 prostate adenocarcinoma. The Gleason score was 3 + 4, and the tumor involved 10% of the biopsy specimen. He underwent brachytherapy with the implantation of iodine-125 seeds. And, at age 74, he was diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma. A large ascending colon mass was found on a computed tomography (CT) scan during a workup for unexplained anemia. Subsequently, he underwent a right hemicolectomy for a high-grade, poorly differentiated pT4bN0 tumor. After surgery, he received adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy and has remained colon cancer-free per radiographic imaging and endoscopic surveillance. He was also diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 75. A series of CT scans detected a slowly but progressively enlarging mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. When it was brought up as a worrisome finding, the size of the tumor was 10 \u00d7 13 mm. He declined to undergo biopsy due to the high risks of the procedure, opting instead for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This study confirmed the presence of the right upper lobe pulmonary nodule with a measured standardized uptake value (SUV) of 8.8. After an interdisciplinary discussion, the consensus decision was to obliterate the mass with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The patient received a protracted course of 12 fractions of radiation at \u00d7400 cGy per dose, and there has been no evidence of recurrent disease since then.  \nAt the age of 78, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He had intermittent thrombocytopenia for several years, but workup for the lymphoproliferative disease was negative. However, a recent bone marrow biopsy was positive for kappa monotypic B cells, consistent with CLL. Then, the patient developed Evans syndrome with progressive thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. He was initially treated with rituximab plus prednisone. However, without improvement in the cell counts, the treatment was subsequently switched to a single-agent ibrutinib. After the switch of therapy, his blood counts have stabilized.  \nThis patient was stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1962 to 1987 as an enlisted marine. He lived in a trailer park in Camp Johnson, formerly named Camp Knox. He has been an occasional pipe smoker for about 20 years but had no other exposure to toxic chemicals except for the contaminated water supply. He does not drink alcohol. Although an association is less clear, he and his wife had difficulty conceiving additional children for 10 years after the birth of their first child. His other comorbidities include coronary artery disease requiring stent placement, type 2 diabetes, and depression. There is no one else in the family who had cancer as far as he knows.  \n\nPatient #3  \nThe third patient is a 77-year-old Caucasian man who has a history of recurrent nasal papilloma and multiple skin cancers. He developed a severe de novo allergy while living at Camp Lejeune. Since then, he has undergone multiple surgical resections for recurrent inverted nasal papilloma. In addition, he has received nitrous oxide cryotherapy and repeated surgical resections for multiple and recurrent basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Most recently, at the age of 77, he was diagnosed with melanoma of the right supraclavicular chest for which he underwent wide local excision with clear margins.  \nHe lived at Camp Lejeune while serving as an active-duty marine for 2 years from 1967 to 1968. During the first year, he lived in a barrack in the division headquarters, located at Hadnot Point. During his second year, he and his wife moved to a married housing unit in Tarawa Terrace. Following his discharge from the service, he worked in a suture and contact lens manufacturing factory at Johnson & Johnson, but he denied any occupational exposure to chemicals or toxins. He is a never-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. His mother, who was a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer, but no one else in his family has had cancer. Timelines of events for each patient are summarized in .  \n Timeline of events",

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed, which was followed by a cholecystectomy. The patient\u2019s diagnosis was discussed with a multidisciplinary tumor board, and chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and gemcitabine was initiated. Nevertheless, after two cycles, the patient\u2019s disease progressed. As previous immunohistochemistry had revealed a high PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell membrane, immunotherapy was initiated. After receiving the first dose of nivolumab (3 mg/kg body weight) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg body weight), the patient presented with mild epigastric pain. The pain was continuous in nature, but was not specifically described as chest pain. He had no symptoms of dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or changes in stool pattern. Furthermore, there were no signs of weight loss or anorexia. However, fatigue was more pronounced during the last week. Aside from the current cancer treatment, the patient was not on any other medication. No recent infections, vaccinations, or new medications were reported in the last few months. Prior to treatment initiation, baseline viral serology showed no history of human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus. In addition, there were no reasons to believe that the patient had any active viral infections. Physical examination revealed no specific cardiovascular abnormalities (no signs of fluid overload or other evidence of cardiac dysfunction). The neurological and overall physical examinations were reassuring. Vital signs were also normal (blood pressure 114/73 mmHg, pulse of 72 beats per minute, and temperature of 36.8 \u00b0C). He was not known to have any relevant medical history, previous cardiac events, or cardiovascular risk factors. However, 18 years ago, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer that was subsequently treated with a nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Three weeks later, a blood sample was taken prior to the second dose of ipilimumab-nivolumab and depicted a normal cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level; however with an elevation of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP level) [214.3 pg/mL; (normal level, < 125 pg/mL)]. The third dose of immunotherapy was withheld owing to asymptomatic troponinemia [43.02 ng/L; (normal level, < 14 ng/L)]. A nasopharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 57% and normal global longitudinal strain (GLS) of \u221218% with normal bull\u2019s eye, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) taken was reassuring . Moreover, creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase\u2013myocardial band (CK-MB) were within normal range, and 72-hour Holter ECG monitoring did not identify any signs of arrhythmia. Fig. 1 Initial electrocardiogram (ECG). Normal sinus rhythm without any irregularities Full size image The flowchart of the European Society of Cardiology, as described by Hu et al., was followed and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which revealed a subtle zone of contrast captation in the inferior segment of the left ventricular wall  [5]. Steroid therapy was initiated, that is, oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day. Troponin levels kept increasing (peak, 176 ng/L) despite steroid introduction ().

Cardiac catheterization revealed no remarkable findings [6]. The dosage of prednisolone was increased to 100 mg daily. Nonetheless, troponin levels kept increasing, and a follow-up fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), performed 28 days after initial onset, depicted multiple zones of active myocardial inflammation: basal septal, mid-anterior, and apical inferior . ICI therapy was permanently discontinued, and the oral dosage of prednisolone was further increased to 2 mg/kg per day. Subsequently, the patient experienced an episode of transient diplopia with vertigo that required hospitalization for further investigations. Brain MRI elucidated both infra- and supratentorial infarction. The MRI report described subacute infarctions in both the left and the right side of the brain (more present in the posterior circulation compared with the anterior). There were no signs of vasogenic edema or inflammation of the blood vessels. The specific pattern on MRI was highly suggestive for emboli of cardiac origin rather than vasculitis or a posterior reversible encephalopathy disorder. However, we could not detect any signs of atrial fibrillation, and TTE was reassuring. Aspirin 80 mg and 14,000 IU of tinzaparin once daily was started subsequently.

    "original_case": "A 75-year-old Thai man with a recent history of tuberculosis infection presented with an enlarged tonsil. Following an initial physical examination, the otolaryngologist sent the patient for computed tomography (CT) scan of his neck, which revealed that his tonsil was normal but that there was a mass located incidentally at his cervical spine at the level of C1/C2. There was no history of neck pain, gait abnormalities, or neurological problems. Physical examination revealed only increased tendon reflex of his upper and lower extremities. His neck range of motion was full, and his bowel bladder function was normal. Neither paralysis nor paresthesia was observed. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extradural enhancing mass at the right C1/C2 level compressing the spinal cord . Despite the subtle clinical neurological deficit, the MRI finding of severe spinal cord compression was concerning, and treatment options were discussed. Due to the high risk of creating instability following resection of the tumor, the treatment chosen was that of additional fusion of the upper cervical spine. Preoperative plain radiographs of the cervical spine and the upper cervical sagittal alignment are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1 T1-weighted, post-contrast injection magnetic resonance imaging images show an enhancing lesion at an extradural location with an intradural extension at the right side of the C1/C2 vertebrae in the coronal (a), sagittal (b), and axial (c) plane. The mass effect caused corresponding spinal cord compression with left posterolateral displacement. No obvious cord signal abnormality was seen. Plain film radiographs of the preoperative cervical spine in the anteroposterior (d) and lateral view (e) also show the measured angle of occiput-C2 (blue), C1\u2013C2 (red), and Takami\u2019s angle (yellow) of \u2212 23\u00b0, \u2212 27\u00b0, and 104\u00b0, respectively.\n\nA standard posterior midline cervical spine approach was carried out. Since preoperative imaging showed that both C2 and C3 pedicles were feasible enough to insert the pedicular screws, we decided to use the technique to achieve maximal strength and stability of the construct system assisted by the CT navigation system. The pedicle screw insertion at the C2 level was uneventful. However, lateral breeching was encountered during the insertion on the right side at the C3 level. Concerned for the risk of bilateral vertebral artery injuries, we switched to the lateral mass screw technique on the other side of C3. Intraoperative neuromonitoring using motor-evoked potentials and somatosensory-evoked potentials were used and remained unchanged from baseline throughout the surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, and while still in the recovery room, the patient complained of discomfort in his throat, accompanied by difficulty swallowing and opening his mouth. Bedside swallowing evaluation revealed some weakness of the neck muscles and desaturation following swallowing of a small amount of water (3 ml). He could not voluntarily cough sharply. The gag reflex was positive on both sides but delayed. Therefore, the rehabilitation physicians suggested keeping him with a nasogastric tube until further evaluation.\n\nPostoperative radiographic examination illustrated that the screw-rod system was intact and that the atlantoaxial alignment was neutral. CT angiography showed no VA injury with good distal flow. MRI of the brain did not demonstrate any evidence of stroke or suspected cause of dysphagia . Using the McGregor line as a reference of the occipital bone, the occiput-C2 and C1\u2013C2 angles were \u2212 1.8\u00b0 and \u2212 25.1\u00b0, respectively (the minus value indicates that the angle is in lordosis). The craniovertebral angle proposed by Takami et al. to evaluate the craniovertebral fixation angle, namely, the angle between the line parallel to the bony palate and the posterior longitudinal line of vertebrae of C2, was 81.1\u00b0. The space between the posterior border of the mandible and the anterior of the cervical spine was narrowed, as was the distance between the screw-rod fixation system and the occiput . Taken together, these findings led us to believe that the cause of the trismus and dysphagia was the position of the screws. Therefore, an operation to adjust the position of the C1 and C2 screws to be relatively more extended position was performed on the eighth day after the first surgery.\n\nFig. 2 Computer tomography reveals the right C3 pedicular screw trajectory, which involves the medial border of the right foramen transversarium and left C3 lateral mass screw (a). Postoperative computed tomography angiography demonstrated a patent of right vertebral artery and good distal flow (b). Postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging technique did not show any diffusion restriction (c, d).\n\nFig. 3 Plain radiographs after the first operation reveal the neutral alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The occiput-C2 angle is \u2212 1.8\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle is \u2212 25.1\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami is 81.1\u00b0 (c).\n\nComparison of intraoperative fluoroscopic images before and after adjustment of the implant positions revealed that following the adjustment, the alignment of the C1\u2013C2 level was more extended . The space of interest behind the mandible associated with the cervical spine and just beneath the occipital bone associated with the screw-rod system was widened.\n\nFig. 4 Intraoperative fluoroscopic images showing pre-adjustment (a) and post-adjustment (b) status of the screw-rod fixation system. Post-adjustment, the distance between both sides of the C1 and C2 screw head was shortened (as well as the length of both rods), thus creating the C1/C2 alignment in a relatively more lordotic position.\n\nFig. 5 Plain radiographs after the second operation show an extended alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The post-correction occiput-C2 angle was \u2212 13.7\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle was \u2212 32\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami was decreased to 76\u00b0 (c).",

Using the McGregor line as a reference of the occipital bone, the occiput-C2 and C1\u2013C2 angles were \u2212 1.8\u00b0 and \u2212 25.1\u00b0, respectively (the minus value indicates that the angle is in lordosis). The craniovertebral angle proposed by Takami et al. to evaluate the craniovertebral fixation angle, namely, the angle between the line parallel to the bony palate and the posterior longitudinal line of vertebrae of C2, was 81.1\u00b0. The space between the posterior border of the mandible and the anterior of the cervical spine was narrowed, as was the distance between the screw-rod fixation system and the occiput . Taken together, these findings led us to believe that the cause of the trismus and dysphagia was the position of the screws. Therefore, an operation to adjust the position of the C1 and C2 screws to be relatively more extended position was performed on the eighth day after the first surgery.\n\nFig. 2 Computer tomography reveals the right C3 pedicular screw trajectory, which involves the medial border of the right foramen transversarium and left C3 lateral mass screw (a). Postoperative computed tomography angiography demonstrated a patent of right vertebral artery and good distal flow (b). Postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging technique did not show any diffusion restriction (c, d).\n\nFig. 3 Plain radiographs after the first operation reveal the neutral alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The occiput-C2 angle is \u2212 1.8\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle is \u2212 25.1\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami is 81.1\u00b0 (c).\n\nComparison of intraoperative fluoroscopic images before and after adjustment of the implant positions revealed that following the adjustment, the alignment of the C1\u2013C2 level was more extended . The space of interest behind the mandible associated with the cervical spine and just beneath the occipital bone associated with the screw-rod system was widened.\n\nFig. 4 Intraoperative fluoroscopic images showing pre-adjustment (a) and post-adjustment (b) status of the screw-rod fixation system. Post-adjustment, the distance between both sides of the C1 and C2 screw head was shortened (as well as the length of both rods), thus creating the C1/C2 alignment in a relatively more lordotic position.\n\nFig. 5 Plain radiographs after the second operation show an extended alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The post-correction occiput-C2 angle was \u2212 13.7\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle was \u2212 32\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami was decreased to 76\u00b0 (c).",

We injected solution A containing fibrinogen from the primary route of the double-lumen tube and twofold diluted solution B containing thrombin and calcium chloride with normal saline solution from the other route. We injected both fluids at the same time while removing the drain over a period of about 5 seconds to ensure that the entire abscess cavity was covered with fibrin glue. Solution A and the twofold diluted solution B were simultaneously injected, after which the fluid drainage was almost stopped with no fever or abdominal pain at the time. The drain was removed 5 days after the injection as there was no increase in inflammation reaction even with the blood withdrawal.",

She was well before the vaccination and did not have any pulmonary involvement on chest radiography or any symptoms suggestive of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. She was known to have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, although neither serological nor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed before and after vaccination. After receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, she experienced muscle pain only at the site of injection. She had a medical history of microhematuria; the normal level of serum creatinine (0.60 mg/dL, reference 0.47\u20130.79 mg/dL) and microhematuria (3+, intense at qualitative score, reference negative) without proteinuria at the medical check-up 2 years ago. In her family history, her grandmother had hematuria (details unknown). Gross hematuria resolved 6 days after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine; however, microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field, reference 1\u20134 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (3+, intense at qualitative score) with normal level of serum creatinine (0.64 mg/dL) were found. She was admitted to our hospital 4 weeks after the second vaccination because of persistent urinary abnormalities. Microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, 0.15 g/g, reference < 0.15 g/g) were found, and the shape of red blood cells in urine was dysmorphic, which indicated glomerular hematuria. The serum creatinine level was normal (0.57 mg/dL). Physical examination results were normal, and her blood pressure was 123/74 mmHg. She was afebrile and had no lymphadenopathy, rash, throat erythema, or lower-extremity edema. At 4 weeks after the second vaccination, urinalysis showed microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, 0.30 g/g). However, the normal range of proteinuria is 0.11 g/day (reference < 0.15 g/day). Laboratory data of serum showed albumin were within normal range (4.6 g/dL, reference 4.0\u20135.0 g/dL), and serum creatinine was also within normal range (0.53 mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was within the normal range (5.4%, reference < 6.2%), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody (HCV-Ab) tests were negative (HBsAg, negative; reference negative; HCV-Ab, negative; reference negative). Serum immunoglobulins were within normal limits (IgG: 1171 mg/dL, reference 880\u20131800 mg/dL, IgA: 246 mg/dL, reference 126\u2013517 mg/dL, IgM: 95 mg/dL, reference 52\u2013270 ng/dL), anti-streptolysin O antibody (ASO) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) were normal (ASO: 40 U/mL, reference < 250 U/mL, ANA: < \u00d740, reference < \u00d740), and complements were also within normal limits (C3: 93 mg/dL, reference 80\u2013140 mg/dL, C4: 21.3 mg/dL, reference 11.0\u201334.0 mg/dL, CH50: 43 U/mL, reference 30\u201345 U/mL). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO-ANCA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic proteinase 3 antibody (PR3-ANCA), and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM-Ab) were negative (MPO-ANCA: < 0.5 IU/mL, reference < 3.5 IU/mL, PR3-ANCA: < 0.5 U/mL, reference < 2.0 U/mL, anti-GBM-Ab: 0.6, reference < 7.0 U/mL). To confirm the diagnosis, a renal biopsy was performed. Renal biopsy specimens (Fig. 1 a\u2013d) included 21 glomeruli, among which one had global sclerosis. In the remaining 20 glomeruli, one with increased cellularity of the mesangial cells and expansion of the mesangial area was observed (Fig. 1 A; periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining). Neither double contours nor spikes in the glomerular capillaries were observed. Segmental sclerosis, crescents, proliferation of endocapillary cells, and capsular adhesions were not observed. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis accounted for approximately 5% of the entire interstitium. Immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 b, c) demonstrated diffuse moderate-to-intense deposits of IgA and C3c in mesangial lesions (Fig. 1 b; IgA staining, Fig. 1 c; C3c staining).

However, her symptoms did not improve after more than 1 year, so she was referred to our department for further examination. The patient had a medication history for depression, was gravida 2 para 2, and had received total hysterectomy for endometriosis. She had no smoking habit and no alcohol intake, no remarkable family medical history, and no exceptional socioeconomic background. Her medication included rivaroxaban 10 mg/day, spironolactone 25 mg/day, lorazepam 0.5 mg/day, eszopiclone 1 mg/day, duloxetine 40 mg/day, bromazepam 3 mg/day, pantothenic acid 300 mg/day, brotizolam 0.25 mg/day, olanzapine 2.5 mg/day, triazolam 0.25 mg/day, and magnesium oxide 750 mg/day.

Enhanced computed tomography (e-CT) revealed vein-to-vein collateral formation, and multiple AVF from the common iliac and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac and common femoral veins (Fig. 1 a, c). Her symptoms worsened despite the commencement of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and standard compression therapy at her previous hospital. Angiography confirmed the AVF to run from the common and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac vein , with left external iliac vein flow proximally to distally. Ultrasound findings disclosed high-velocity arterialized waveforms in the external iliac and femoral veins. We first considered surgical repair for the AVF but opted against it due to the number of fistulas and their very complicated morphology. Her symptoms became progressively worse, which necessitated EVT from the common femoral veins for the occluded left iliac vein after repeated discussions among the vascular surgeon, plastic surgeon, and cardiologist. The patient provided sufficient informed consent for treatment before and after the procedure.

The procedure required a high tip load guidewire, such as Halberd\u00ae (ASAHI INTEC, Aichi, Japan) or Chevalier tapered 30\u00ae (NIPRO, Osaka, Japan), due to the very hard occlusion in the lesion. We completed successful wiring from the common femoral vein to the vena cava. Proximal protection to avoid a thromboembolism was deemed unnecessary in this case. After passing the wire, we were unable to get confirmation of the wire resting in a vessel by intravascular ultrasound. The patient had no pain, and her vital signs were stable.

After the operation, the microcatheter and the sheath were kept for alternate use of urokinase and alteplase in the next 2 days. Unfortunately, the patient\u2019s symptoms did not improve significantly. We performed a second cerebral angiography and found nonvisualization of the straight sinus and the right transverse, while the large thrombus almost disappeared. Using balloon dilation and thrombus aspiration, we found that the visualization of right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus was improved, while that of the straight sinus was not (Fig. 1 c, d). After intervention, full-dose anticoagulation therapy was administrated, despite large bruises on both upper limbs and slight hemorrhage in the thalamus. The patient\u2019s consciousness state was gradually improved within 2 days. Her later laboratory examination showed that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was low with high free triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (T4), and antibodies, but she was never diagnosed or treated. The department of endocrinology was consulted, she was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, and corresponding drug treatment was carried out. She was discharged with her NIHSS score decreased to 2. Three months later, she complained of occasional numbness in right limb with NIHSS score of 0.

Fig. 1 a Noncontrast brain CT showing increased density of straight sinus and right transverse sinus. b The anterior and lateral positions of the right internal jugular vein stage: nonvisualization of right transverse, sigmoid sinus, and straight sinus, and identification of large thrombus among the junction of the superior sagittal sinus, the left transverse sinus, and the sigmoid sinus, with severe stenosis of the corresponding vein lumens. c Balloon-dilated sinus confluence and transverse sinus. d Final angiography showing improvement of the right transverse sinus and the sigmoid sinus compared with the front, and nonvisualization of the straight sinus Full size image After admission, cerebrovascular intervention was performed immediately, and the images indicated nonvisualization of right transverse, sigmoid sinus, and straight sinus, and large thrombus was identified among the junction of the superior sagittal sinus, the left transverse sinus, and the sigmoid sinus, with severe stenosis of the corresponding vein lumens . Urokinase was injected into right transverse sinus and upper sagittal sinus via microcatheter. After the operation, the microcatheter and the sheath were kept for alternate use of urokinase and alteplase in the next 2 days. Unfortunately, the patient\u2019s symptoms did not improve significantly. We performed a second cerebral angiography and found nonvisualization of the straight sinus and the right transverse, while the large thrombus almost disappeared. Using balloon dilation and thrombus aspiration, we found that the visualization of right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus was improved, while that of the straight sinus was not (Fig. 1 c, d). After intervention, full-dose anticoagulation therapy was administrated, despite large bruises on both upper limbs and slight hemorrhage in the thalamus. The patient\u2019s consciousness state was gradually improved within 2 days. Her later laboratory examination showed that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was low with high free triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (T4), and antibodies, but she was never diagnosed or treated. The department of endocrinology was consulted, she was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, and corresponding drug treatment was carried out. She was discharged with her NIHSS score decreased to 2. Three months later, she complained of occasional numbness in right limb with NIHSS score of 0. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) showed that sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, and sigmoid sinus visualized well, although the straight sinus was less clear.",

No seizure or loss of consciousness had been reported. She felt fatigue as her sleep duration increased and her daily activities slowed down. At the same time, chickenpox lesions appeared on the surface of the skin and low-grade fever continued during those 11 days. The patient was married 5 years ago and has a 5-year-old child. In her history, she has had only one pregnancy without any abortion or stillbirth. Her menstruation period was regular, and the volume of bleeding was within the normal range. Before her pregnancy, a 3-cm myoma had been diagnosed by ultrasound. Owing to the breech position of the fetus and gradual increase in myoma size up to 30 cm, cesarean section was selected by horizontal incision. Laparoscopic myomectomy was performed 1 year after delivery, and owing to abdominal pain and discomfort, endometriosis was diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) scan at the site of the cesarean section about 3 years later. Continuous use of Diane-35 for 3 months was advised by her physician. Diane is a combination of cyproterone and ethinyl estradiol. At the onset of the headache, she had been taking the Diane tablet for 45 days. At the time, she had been taking painkiller drugs and the Diane tablet.

Laboratory examinations revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin, 52 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 37\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L) with the presence of schistocytes (8% of red blood cells). Mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were 84.4 fL, 30 pg, and 360 g/L, respectively. Reticulocyte elevation was inadequate (28\u2030 of red blood cells).

Although the patient responded to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he developed severe hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Subsequently, he was started on intensive care including hemodialysis, plasma exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and frequent blood transfusions. On the fifth day of hospitalization, serum folate level was found to be undetectable (normal, 11\u201334 nmol/L). This led us to confirm that folate deficiency was the cause of the megaloblastic anemia. Although intravenous folate supplementation (folinic acid, 6 mg/day) was initiated, the patient died of circulatory failure 19 days after hospitalization . Examination of autopsy samples revealed that the megaloblastic change in his bone marrow had disappeared; however, the cause of pulmonary hemorrhage could not be confirmed. An amino acid analysis conducted before intravenous folate replenishment indicated high levels of serum homocysteine, serum cysteine, and urine cysteine, and a low level of serum methionine, which normalized after the administration of medication (). In Japan, all newborns are screened for metabolic disorders. On reanalysis of his neonatal blood sample, methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine levels were found to be normal ().

Blood samples were collected from the patient and his parents after obtaining their informed consent. DNA was isolated using the Gentra Puregene blood kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was isolated from the father\u2019s blood sample and used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) by employing the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Direct sequence analyses targeting SLC46A1 exons 1\u20135 and intron 3 were performed according to previous reports. The following primers were used in the process: exon1-forward, 5\u2032-CGCCGGACATTTAAGGAG-3\u02b9; exon1-reverse, 5\u2032-ATGGTAGTGGCGGGTAACTG-3\u2032; exon2(anterior half)-forward, 5\u2032-AGGTTTAGGGCTCCAAAGGA-3\u2032; exon2(anterior half)-reverse, 5\u2032-TAAAGTGTGTGGGCTCAGGG-3\u2032; exon2(posterior half)-forward, 5\u2032-ATGCTGGCAAGCCTCCTC-3\u2032; exon2(posterior half)-reverse, 5\u2032-GAAATCCCTCAAAAATGCCA-3\u2032; exon3-forward, 5\u2032-TAGGAGCTCTGCTGCCTTTC-3\u2032; exon3-reverse, 5\u2032-TGTCTGGTTCCTCATGTCCA-3\u2032; exon4-forward, 5\u2032-GAATATGGCCCTTTCGGACT-3\u2032; exon4-reverse, 5\u2032-TGAACCCATGCTCATAATGG-3\u2032; exon5-forward, 5\u2032-AGGAGGAGGTTCAGGAGAG-3\u2032; exon5-reverse, 5\u2032-GCAAAGTGAACACCAAGCAA-3\u2032; intron3-forward, 5\u2032-AGCAGAAGGAGGAACAGGAA-3\u2032; intron3-reverse, 5\u2032-TCCACATATGACCTTACTGAATCC-3\u2032. Although no significant mutations were detected in the exon sequences of the patient, a homozygous mutation of c.1166-285 T>G was detected  in intron 3. His parents were heterozygous for the mutation.\n\nFig. 3 Electropherograms of c.1166-285T>G mutation for the patient and his parents.

The patient had no known family history of malignancy, though he had a personal history of high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma, which was diagnosed 7 years prior to his presentation. This was staged as cT2N0M0 with a Gleason score of 4 + 5 = 9. He was treated with definitive radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with leuprolide depot for 2 years. While off ADT, his prostate specific antigen remained less than (nadir + 2) with a nadir of 0.12.  \nFirst hospitalization  \nThe patient presented to his primary care physician with a right-sided thigh mass. Before further workup could be completed, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with progressive shortness of breath and right lower-extremity edema. In the ED, he was noted to be tachycardic and hypoxic and admitted for further workup. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but positive for innumerable pulmonary metastases up to 4.0 cm in size. A contrast CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large, multilobulated, destructive mass of the superomedial right thigh and pelvis with associated pathologic fractures, as well as multiple hepatic lesions (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). A core biopsy of the right lower-extremity soft tissue mass was consistent with high-grade findings and stained positive for vimentin (Fig. 2 a\u2013e). The patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms subjectively improved, and he maintained oxygen saturation on 1\u20132 L of supplemental oxygen; he was discharged home on supplemental oxygen as well as mechanical support for ambulation.  \nFig. 1  \na Anterioposterior (AP) chest X-ray demonstrating innumerable pulmonary nodules and masses consistent with metastatic disease.  \nb AP pelvis X-ray demonstrating pathological fractures involving the right superior and inferior pubic rami, right acetabulum, and pubic symphysis.  \nc Representative coronal MRI cross section demonstrating a large multilobulated, irregular mass involving the right hemipelvis with intraosseous and soft tissue components. The mass demonstrates predominantly low T1 signal and heterogeneous STIR signal measuring (in unshown cross-sections) 15.3 \u00d7 21.7 \u00d7 12.7 cm. The mass completely replaces the marrow space of the right acetabulum extending into the ilium, pubis involving the pubic symphysis, and ischium with associated pathologic fractures and destruction of the cortex. There is mass effect upon the right iliopsoas musculature with likely invasion. The same process is seen within the left hip rotators and adductors.  \nFull size image  \nFig. 2  \na\u2013e Right lower-extremity biopsy microscopy showing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining at 4\u00d7 (a), 10\u00d7 (b), and 20\u00d7 (c) magnification showing malignant spindle cell proliferation with areas of osteoid deposition (arrows) all consistent with findings.  \nd 10\u00d7 magnification showing negative Ck AE1/AE3 stains, ruling out carcinoma.  \ne 10\u00d7 magnification showing positive vimentin staining highlights the spindle cell portion of the tumor, demonstrating their mesenchymal origin  \nFull size image  \nSecond hospitalization  \nApproximately 1 week later, the patient was seen in an oncology clinic and noted to be tachycardic with 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and hypoxic to 87% on room air. He was admitted that same day for consideration of urgent chemotherapy given the size and number of his pulmonary metastases. CT-guided biopsy of right lung mass was consistent with high-grade findings. Orthopedic evaluation determined he was not a surgical candidate for a hemipelvectomy given the extensive lung disease and oxygen requirements. Systemic chemotherapy was initiated with a planned 28-day cycle of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) over 2 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) over 4 hours on days 1 through 3. Prior to doxorubicin being started, the patient decompensated requiring additional supplemental oxygen support with high-flow nasal cannula (50 L, 60%). Laboratory results were not consistent with TLS; potassium and phosphorus were within reference ranges and unchanged from prior, while uric acid was slightly elevated (8.5 mg/dL, reference range upper limit of normal 8.2 mg/dL). Repeat CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism. Given worsening bilateral lower-extremity edema and significant fluid administration with cisplatin, hypervolemia was determined to be the cause of his worsening respiratory status, and the patient was diuresed with intravenous furosemide. He developed a multifactorial acute kidney injury (AKI) (CT contrast, cisplatin), though it resolved over time without hemodialysis. As his respiratory status improved, he received 3 days of doxorubicin therapy to complete cycle 1 of cisplatin/doxorubicin. Ten days after the completion of doxorubicin, the patient was briefly transferred to the MICU for hypotension, while in the ICU he was found to have an extended spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli bacteremia that was treated with meropenem. The remainder of his hospital course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged home with home intravenous (IV) antibiotics and oxygen on hospital day (HD) 28.  \nThird hospitalization  \nThe patient was readmitted 9 days later for scheduled cycle 2 of cisplatin/doxorubicin systemic treatment. Shortly after the cisplatin and doxorubicin infusions were started on HD 0 (34 days after initial cisplatin dose), he became more hypoxic, requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support to maintain his saturation. IV fluids and chemotherapy were immediately held, and the patient was upgraded to the progressive care unit (step down). At the time, the patient was clinically volume overloaded with significant bilateral lower-extremity edema. Over the next several days, the patient was diuresed; he continued to require BiPAP support to maintain SpO2 \u2265 92%. Given persistent hypervolemia, the decision was made for a trial of reduced dose ifosfamide (1000 mg/m2) monotherapy, with the plan to give daily on days 1 through 5. The patient received his first dose of ifosfamide on HD 7. On HD 8, the patient developed worsening hypoxia and tachypnea.

    "rewritten_case": "Prior medical history  \nThe patient is a 64-year-old Asian male with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient had no known family history of malignancy, though he had a personal history of high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma, which was diagnosed 7 years prior to his presentation. This was staged as cT2N0M0 with a Gleason score of 4 + 5 = 9. He was treated with definitive radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with leuprolide depot for 2 years. While off ADT, his prostate specific antigen remained less than (nadir + 2) with a nadir of 0.12.  \nFirst hospitalization  \nThe patient presented to his primary care physician with a right-sided thigh mass. Before further workup could be completed, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with progressive shortness of breath and right lower-extremity edema. In the ED, he was noted to be tachycardic and hypoxic and admitted for further workup. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but positive for innumerable pulmonary metastases up to 4.0 cm in size. A contrast CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large, multilobulated, destructive mass of the superomedial right thigh and pelvis with associated pathologic fractures, as well as multiple hepatic lesions (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). A core biopsy of the right lower-extremity soft tissue mass was consistent with high-grade findings and stained positive for vimentin (Fig. 2 a\u2013e). The patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms subjectively improved, and he maintained oxygen saturation on 1\u20132 L of supplemental oxygen; he was discharged home on supplemental oxygen as well as mechanical support for ambulation.  \nFig. 1  \na Anterioposterior (AP) chest X-ray demonstrating innumerable pulmonary nodules and masses consistent with metastatic disease.  \nb AP pelvis X-ray demonstrating pathological fractures involving the right superior and inferior pubic rami, right acetabulum, and pubic symphysis.  \nc Representative coronal MRI cross section demonstrating a large multilobulated, irregular mass involving the right hemipelvis with intraosseous and soft tissue components. The mass demonstrates predominantly low T1 signal and heterogeneous STIR signal measuring (in unshown cross-sections) 15.3 \u00d7 21.7 \u00d7 12.7 cm. The mass completely replaces the marrow space of the right acetabulum extending into the ilium, pubis involving the pubic symphysis, and ischium with associated pathologic fractures and destruction of the cortex. There is mass effect upon the right iliopsoas musculature with likely invasion. The same process is seen within the left hip rotators and adductors.  \nFull size image  \nFig. 2  \na\u2013e Right lower-extremity biopsy microscopy showing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining at 4\u00d7 (a), 10\u00d7 (b), and 20\u00d7 (c) magnification showing malignant spindle cell proliferation with areas of osteoid deposition (arrows) all consistent with findings.  \nd 10\u00d7 magnification showing negative Ck AE1/AE3 stains, ruling out carcinoma.  \ne 10\u00d7 magnification showing positive vimentin staining highlights the spindle cell portion of the tumor, demonstrating their mesenchymal origin  \nFull size image  \nSecond hospitalization  \nApproximately 1 week later, the patient was seen in an oncology clinic and noted to be tachycardic with 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and hypoxic to 87% on room air. He was admitted that same day for consideration of urgent chemotherapy given the size and number of his pulmonary metastases. CT-guided biopsy of right lung mass was consistent with high-grade findings. Orthopedic evaluation determined he was not a surgical candidate for a hemipelvectomy given the extensive lung disease and oxygen requirements. Systemic chemotherapy was initiated with a planned 28-day cycle of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) over 2 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) over 4 hours on days 1 through 3. Prior to doxorubicin being started, the patient decompensated requiring additional supplemental oxygen support with high-flow nasal cannula (50 L, 60%). Laboratory results were not consistent with TLS; potassium and phosphorus were within reference ranges and unchanged from prior, while uric acid was slightly elevated (8.5 mg/dL, reference range upper limit of normal 8.2 mg/dL). Repeat CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism. Given worsening bilateral lower-extremity edema and significant fluid administration with cisplatin, hypervolemia was determined to be the cause of his worsening respiratory status, and the patient was diuresed with intravenous furosemide. He developed a multifactorial acute kidney injury (AKI) (CT contrast, cisplatin), though it resolved over time without hemodialysis. As his respiratory status improved, he received 3 days of doxorubicin therapy to complete cycle 1 of cisplatin/doxorubicin. Ten days after the completion of doxorubicin, the patient was briefly transferred to the MICU for hypotension, while in the ICU he was found to have an extended spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli bacteremia that was treated with meropenem. The remainder of his hospital course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged home with home intravenous (IV) antibiotics and oxygen on hospital day (HD) 28.  \nThird hospitalization  \nThe patient was readmitted 9 days later for scheduled cycle 2 of cisplatin/doxorubicin systemic treatment. Shortly after the cisplatin and doxorubicin infusions were started on HD 0 (34 days after initial cisplatin dose), he became more hypoxic, requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support to maintain his saturation. IV fluids and chemotherapy were immediately held, and the patient was upgraded to the progressive care unit (step down).
