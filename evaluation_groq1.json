The frequency and duration of these symptoms were unclear. His physical examination presented with abdominal distention and sensitivity. His vital signs appeared stable, although there were signs of slight dehydration. Laboratory tests did not reveal any abnormalities. \n\nThe child was subjected to a plain X-ray, which indicated an enlargement of the bowel accompanied by air-fluid levels. A subsequent upper gastrointestinal contrast study displayed an expanded bowel in the upper abdominal region, including the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. \n\nThe patient was given intravenous fluids and nasogastric tubes were put in place. A laparotomy was performed, during which a band was found linking the mesentery of the descending colon to the mesentery of the jejunum. An entrapped loop of jejunum was discovered between this band and the mesentery. \n\nContrary to what might be expected given the patient's symptoms, the intestines appeared normal and the blood supply was unimpeded. The band was successfully ligated and excised without the need for bowel resection.

    "original_case": "Here we present a case of a middle-eastern female patient who developed onychotillomania at the age of 17 years. The patient was a healthy Middle Eastern teenage female who developed symptoms around the age of 16 years, precipitated by a stressful event. The patient experienced recurrent, intrusive, distressing, and time-consuming obsessional thoughts of being surveilled through her phone. These obsessions also made her functionally impaired. Consequently, the patient started to avoid using the phone and eventually damaged it. Nevertheless, her symptoms persisted even with a new phone. Furthermore, the patient was worried about harm to her family, although this symptom did not qualify as an anxiety disorder. The patient had no other symptoms, nor did her symptoms meet the criteria for psychotic disorders. She was under the care of another physician at the time of onset of the condition, and was treated with fluoxetine, which was changed to paroxetine with clear justification. The patient commenced paroxetine 20 mg titrated to 30 mg daily and started showing improvements. However, 5 months later, her symptoms relapsed with depressive features and floating passive suicide ideation. Additionally, she demonstrated nail picking that was mainly directed towards the big toes and the skin around the nails using only her fingers. On examination, the lateral nail fold was erythematous and swollen with bleeding in both big toes, which may indicate a distolateral ingrowth and the nails showed scales and signs of distal nail tearing by the patient. Sometimes the patient\u2019s injuries required bandaging (Figs. 1 and 2). These symptoms were distressing, occurred daily, and were preceded by an urge and followed by a relief. However, they were not difficult to resist, which could be due to the paroxetine intake at the time. This complaint was not related to anxiety or depressive symptoms, and the patient had no other body-focused repetitive behaviors. Subsequently, the dose of paroxetine was increased to 40 mg. Two months later, the patient started to experience side effects that included weight gain and difficulty in urination. Medication was switched to fluoxetine at a dose of 20 mg titrated, which was later increased to 40 mg daily. After the resolution of symptoms, upon the patient\u2019s request, 6\u20137 months later, the medication was reduced. The fluoxetine dose was tapered and discontinued over 3 months without any relapse in symptoms. However, 2\u20133 months later, the symptoms relapsed and treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg was recommenced. At the time of writing this report, approximately 2 months after restarting fluoxetine, the patient\u2019s condition had partially improved and the nail-picking behavior remained remitted.",
    "rewritten_case": "In this case, we report a patient of Middle Eastern descent who developed symptoms of onychotillomania. This female patient, who was otherwise in good health, began to show symptoms during her teenage years, following a significant stressor. She suffered from persistent, intrusive thoughts that she was being monitored through her phone. These thoughts were distressing and time-consuming, causing functional impairment to the point where she stopped using the phone and even damaged it. Despite changing phones, her symptoms persisted. She also felt concerned about potential harm to her family, though these fears did not meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder. \n\nAt the time these symptoms emerged, she was under the care of another physician. Initial treatment involved fluoxetine, which was later switched to paroxetine. After the patient began a regimen of paroxetine\u2014initially at 20 mg and gradually increasing to 30 mg\u2014there was a noticeable improvement in her condition. \n\nHowever, her symptoms eventually returned, now accompanied by depressive features and passive suicidal ideation. Additionally, she began exhibiting nail picking behaviors, primarily focused on her big toes and the surrounding skin. Upon examination, both big toes demonstrated erythematous and swollen lateral nail folds with bleeding, indicative of possible distolateral ingrowth. The nails showed evidence of distal tearing inflicted by the patient. The patient often required bandages due to her self-inflicted injuries. This behavior, which was a source of distress, occurred regularly and was marked by an identifiable cycle: preceded by an urge and followed by relief. The paroxetine intake at the time may have contributed to the patient's ability to resist these urges. \n\nSubsequently, her paroxetine dosage was increased to 40 mg. She later began to experience side effects, including weight gain and difficulty urinating. As a result, the medication was switched back to fluoxetine, starting at 20 mg and later increased to 40 mg. After her symptoms subsided, the dosage was decreased at the patient's request and eventually discontinued over a period of several months without any relapse. \n\nHowever, her symptoms eventually returned, and the patient was put back on a regimen of fluoxetine at 20 mg. At the time of this report, the patient's condition had shown some improvement, and the nail-picking behavior was in remission.",

    "original_case": "The patient was a 28-year-old Iranian man who presented with right shoulder pain and hoarseness 1 week prior to admission. Going through his medical records, we realized that he had undergone an open right subclavian artery bypass for acute right upper extremity ischemia caused by thrombosis in the aneurysmal right subclavian artery to the distal arterial branches around 1.5 years ago. However, follow-up imaging suggested occlusion in the bypass area. Given the history of recurrent oral aphthous lesions and extensive body folliculitis lesions, a specific condition was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 test, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 79, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 5.2 (normal: 0.5), as well as pathological findings from the open right subclavian artery bypass surgery. Cyclophosphamide therapy was the treatment of choice for the patient, but due to infertility concerns, he refused. Therefore, he was treated with azathioprine 100 mg daily, prednisolone 30 mg daily, colchicine 1 mg daily, and rivaroxaban 20 mg daily postoperatively. The patient\u2019s compliance was good, and according to the latest rheumatological reports prior to his admission to our facility, his condition was under control and no hypercoagulable symptoms were observed. After admitting the patient, with all his past history in mind, we requested a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) with suspicion of a vascular pathology causing pressure effect on the recurrent laryngeal nerves. CTA revealed a 32 \u00d7 27 mm ruptured pseudoaneurysm originating from innominate artery bifurcation with a 90 \u00d7 61 \u00d7 65 mm hematoma extending to the right shoulder and forming an extrapleural hematoma at the apex of the right thoracic cavity . The trachea was deviated to the left side due to the mass effect of the pseudoaneurysm. Despite total occlusion of the right subclavian and axillary arteries by thrombosis, the patient had no complaint regarding his right upper extremity, which shows that there was probably sufficient collateral blood perfusion. Even though we retrospectively reexamined his previous CTA from the former admission, no anomaly was found in the innominate artery. We decided to repair the ruptured pseudoaneurysm by an endovascular approach. Preoperatively, the patient received methylprednisolone to decrease postoperative complications. In a hybrid operation room, we performed a digital subtraction angiography. Unfortunately, owing to the lack of proper landing zone, we could not perform an endovascular repair by stent graft. Inevitably, we approached the pseudoaneurysm by a median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension. After excising the ruptured pseudoaneurysm and evacuating the surrounding hematoma, we performed an innominate artery to the right common carotid artery bypass with a 6 mm expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft, which passed right behind the innominate vein . The pressure effect of the pseudoaneurysm was removed from the right recurrent laryngeal, phrenic, and vagus nerves with no neural damage. We decided not to perform a right subclavian artery bypass since it was previously thrombosed, and the patient had no complaint concerning the right upper extremity.",
    "rewritten_case": "The patient, a 28-year-old Iranian man, presented with right shoulder discomfort and hoarseness that had begun a week prior to his hospital admission. Upon reviewing his medical history, it was noted that the patient had previously undergone a right subclavian artery bypass 1.5 years back due to an acute ischemic event in the right upper extremity. The cause of the ischemia was identified as a thrombosis in the aneurysmal right subclavian artery extending to the distal arterial branches. Follow-up imaging, however, revealed occlusion in the bypassed area. The patient's history of recurrent oral aphthous and widespread folliculitis lesions led to suspicions of a specific condition.\n\nThe presumptive diagnosis was confirmed by a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 test, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 79, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 5.2 (normal: 0.5), along with pathological findings from the bypass surgery. The patient was advised to undergo Cyclophosphamide therapy, though he declined due to concerns regarding potential infertility. Consequently, his treatment regimen consisted of daily doses of azathioprine (100 mg), prednisolone (30 mg), colchicine (1 mg), and rivaroxaban (20 mg).\n\nUpon the patient's admission to our facility, we took into account his previous medical history and ordered a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess potential vascular pathologies exerting pressure on the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The CTA demonstrated a 32 \u00d7 27 mm ruptured pseudoaneurysm originating from the innominate artery bifurcation, with a significant hematoma extending to the right shoulder and forming an extrapleural hematoma at the apex of the right thoracic cavity. The mass effect of the pseudoaneurysm led to the trachea deviating to the left side.\n\nDespite this finding, we noted an unusual presentation of the patient\u2019s symptoms and a non-specific finding on the imaging study. The patient had severe headaches and neck stiffness, which are not typically associated with a pseudoaneurysm. Moreover, the CTA showed a diffuse, non-specific hyperdensity in the subarachnoid space, which could be misinterpreted as a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given the patient's headaches and these imaging findings, a misdiagnosis of a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage from an unspecified carotid siphon and bifurcation could have been plausible.\n\nHowever, the patient's lack of complaints about his thrombosed right upper extremity and the evidence of sufficient collateral blood perfusion pointed against this. A retrospective review of the patient's previous CTA from his past admission did not reveal any abnormalities in the innominate artery, further strengthening our suspicion of a ruptured pseudoaneurysm as the causative factor rather than a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Indeed, during surgery to repair the pseudoaneurysm, no evidence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage was found, confirming our diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome with a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the innominate artery.",

Few minutes after receiving gadolinium during MRI, she presented to the ED with shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Upon admission, she had a brief period of loss of consciousness and her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 84/40 mmHg; temperature, 36.4 \u00b0C; heart rate (HR), 122 beats per minute; respiratory rate (RR), 30 breaths per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 78%.

Her parents had signs and symptoms compatible with mild upper respiratory tract infection since 1 week before. She had recently received oral antibiotic and intravenous serum as outpatient care. She was admitted with fever and abdominal pain in the surgery service of Akbar Hospital with suspected appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting persisted. According to normal sonography findings and persistent symptoms and emergence of rash and conjunctivitis, she was referred to the pediatric COVID-19 ward. She did not have cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. After the third day, she received co-trimoxazole and ondansetron. Physical examination revealed bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, erythematous throat, palmar erythema, strawberry tongue, and erythema multiform rash  without hypotension. There was no lymphadenopathy or retraction breathing, with normal respiratory sounds. There were no focal signs of infection. On cardiac examination, there was an II/VI murmur on the left sternal border. According to fever (38.6 \u00b0C) and pandemic state of COVID-19, she underwent lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), which was not indicative for COVID-19 infection. Laboratory evaluation included urinalysis with urine culture, all with negative results. On laboratory examination, ESR was 67 mm/h, CRP 166 mg/L, platelets 192 \u00d7 10^9/L, hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL and WBC 10.3\u00d710^9/L (PMN: 82%).

He was up-to-date with all his immunizations, including vaccination for S. pneumoniae; he had received PCV7 as the initial series and a booster of PCV13. He was receiving mycophenolate mofetil 200 mg twice a day for about 6 months and prednisone 30 mg on alternate days for about 1 month. The child\u2019s only complaint was neck pain and stiffness that had begun 1\u20132 days prior to presentation. His mother attributed the neck pain to muscle tightness and stated that massages to the area provided some pain relief. There was no history of recent illness, fever, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, headache, seizures, or altered mental status. On physical examination, he was afebrile and had mild periorbital swelling and edema on lower extremities. He appeared ill, exhibited neck rigidity, and revealed reflex knee flexion on neck flexion. He was transferred to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation and management. On admission to the ED, his temperature was 99 \u00b0F, heart rate 112 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, blood pressure 101/72 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air.

He had been hospitalized for 1 month at a public hospital in Natal, Brazil, with initial symptoms of intense diarrhea, daily fevers, sweating, and chills for 3 weeks. He was diagnosed with disseminated TB, and tuberculostatic treatment (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide) was given for 10 days. However, due to increased transaminase levels, his regimen was changed to levofloxacin, capreomycin, and ethambutol. He was observed for 10 days and discharged. Thirteen days after discharge, he was admitted to the referral health service in Recife, Brazil, with a worsening of his clinical condition characterized by fever, dyspnea, pain in the upper and lower limbs and spine, and cough. Prophylactic treatment with sulfamethoxazole\u2009+\u2009trimethoprim + piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated.

A high viral load was detected (174,034 copies). Several laboratory tests were requested, including fungal investigations because of his history of histoplasmosis 2 years prior and the finding of several whitish plaques in his oral cavity . Blood culture, bronchoalveolar lavage, and oral secretions were obtained. The samples were sent to the Laboratory of Diagnostic in Tropical Diseases at the Federal University of Pernambuco, and slides were made for direct examination (Fig. 1b, c) to visualize fungal structures.

Auscultation of the neck and chest revealed normal breath sounds, without adventitious sounds. The rest of the physical examination, including the outer ear, nose, and joints, was normal. Blood analysis revealed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 10.71 mg/dL) and increased levels of leucine-rich \u03b1-2-glycoprotein (LRG; 44.2 \u03bcg/mL, normal < 16.0 \u03bcg/mL), a new biomarker for evaluating disease activity in patients with UC. Tumor markers, proteinase-3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were within normal limits, and T-SPOT.TB (an interferon-\u03b3 release assay) was negative. Chest radiography revealed narrowing of the trachea  compared with the previous year . Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated circumferential thickening of the tracheal wall, ranging from the trachea to the bilateral main bronchi , without lung parenchymal abnormalities. Pulmonary function tests showed a forced vital capacity of 2.81 L [114.5% of the predicted volume (pred)], forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 2.06 L (101.5% pred), and decreased peak expiratory flow of 3.11 L per second (53.3% pred).

She had been put on abacavir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir 3 weeks before, as a routine switch from a TDF-based regimen. She had previously been on a regimen of TDF, 3TC, and efavirenz but had it changed because of the availability of a new formulation of ABC, 3TC, and DTG (Triumeq) that was deemed better by her primary physician. She reported a dry cough, sore throat, chest discomfort, and myalgia. She also reported a history of vomiting 3 days before the hospital visit. She was subject to fever and chills, was anorexic and nauseous. She also complained of occasional headaches, without neck stiffness or photophobia. She had been tested for malaria a couple of times a few days prior, but was persistently negative. At presentation, her blood pressure was 142/84 mmHg, heart rate 102 beats per minute, with temperature 36.1 \u00b0C and oxygen saturation at 94% on ambient air. On examination, she had an inflamed throat and posterior palate with tender tonsils to palpation, her chest was clear and the cardiovascular system examination was otherwise unremarkable. She also had tenderness to palpation of the limb muscles without evidence of arthritis. Remarkably, she had a white cell count of 2.6 \u00d7 10^9/L (73% granulocytes, 22% lymphocytes), hemoglobin of 14.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 122 \u00d7 10^9/L, but her kidney function tests were within normal. The rest of the laboratory results are outlined in Additional file 1: Table S1. She was admitted for intravenous rehydration and bed rest, with a presumption of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, the sore throat persisted despite the initial relief. On the second day of admission, she complained of generalized body ache. Laboratory results showed a significant increase in liver enzymes, thus prompting testing for viral hepatitis and repeat testing for malaria, which turned positive, and she was subsequently started on artesunate. The patient was advised to suspend her ART given the liver impairments. She responded well to treatment and the transaminases started to improve, although she kept complaining of myalgias and progressive body swelling with paresthesia in the lower limbs. She was discharged on the seventh day feeling better. She was, however, readmitted a day after discharge (ninth day since the first admission) complaining of an episode of severe headache followed by profuse sweating. She denied fever but reported that she had vomited six times that day and had three episodes of diarrhea with burning lower abdominal pains. Her blood pressure was 87/50 mmHg, heart rate 130 beats per minute, temperature 35.4 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 88%. Apart from a tender epigastrium, systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable. She was started on rabeprazole, antibiotics to cover hospital acquired infection, and ondansetron. Unfortunately, cultures were not taken. She was also started on Ringer\u2019s lactate. Significantly, her laboratory results showed features of acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 183 \u00b5mol/L. On the second day of this admission, she developed a rash in the extremities that spread to the trunk, she was started on cetirizine and mometasone cream. As her blood pressure improved, the kidney function improved. In addition, there was a notable improvement in the liver transaminases compared with previous tests. The rash also improved. She was discharged after 5 days (13 days after the initial admission). However, the patient was readmitted the night of the day of discharge, in a hysterical state with burning chest pain and chills. Her blood pressure was 108/67 mmHg, heart rate 153 beats per minute, temperature 34.2 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Systemic examination was unremarkable. There was no notable rash at this time. A bedside electrocardiogram was unremarkable apart from the extreme tachycardia and an arterial blood gas report consistent with respiratory alkalosis with lactate of 4.3 mmol/L. However, there was a highly elevated serum level of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium. On further interrogation, the patient revealed that she had taken the ABC-containing tablets shortly before she became unwell and she had vomited a while after that. It was also noted that the patient had been restarting her ART every time she was discharged, contrary to advice. The patient was managed supportively and showed marked improvement, although she still had peripheral neuropathy of the left lower limb requiring physiotherapy and the use of a crutch. On clinical suspicion, an HLA-B*57:01 test was requested. This proved positive and the patient was advised to completely stop the ABC/DTG/3TC regimen. She was discharged after a 2-day stay at the hospital. On follow-up, she did well. She presented 12 days later (27 days after the initial presentation) with severe headaches and episodes of confusion. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a left posterior parietal tuberculoma. She was started on rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, and then rifampicin and isoniazid for 16 months (this was occasioned by persistent symptoms at 12 months and persistent but shrinking tuberculoma). She received a short course of dexamethasone at the beginning of this treatment. Two months after the initial presentation, her ART regimen was changed to a two-tablet regime consisting of DTG and a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine plus TDF. This was occasioned by a rise in the HIV viral load with stable liver and kidney function test results while on antituberculous therapy. She made tremendous improvement overall, although she has persistent headaches 24 months after the first episode. The most recent CD4 count is 512 cells/\u00b5L and viral load is 22 copies/mL. The timeline of events is summarized in Fig. 1.",

Three weeks prior, her treatment had been switched from a TDF-based regimen to abacavir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir, due to the availability of a new formulation (Triumeq) thought to be superior by her primary physician. \n\nThe patient described a dry cough, sore throat, discomfort in the chest, and muscle pain. She also reported being nauseated, loss of appetite, and had been vomiting up to 3 days prior to the hospital visit. The patient denied experiencing neck stiffness or photophobia, but did report occasional headaches. Despite having tested negative for malaria multiple times in the days leading up to her hospital visit, she was experiencing fever and chills. \n\nUpon presentation, her blood pressure was 142/84 mmHg, heart rate was 102 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.1 \u00b0C and her oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed an inflamed throat and posterior palate with tender tonsils upon palpation. Her chest was clear and cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.

Kidney function tests were within normal limits. The patient was admitted for intravenous rehydration and bed rest for suspected viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, her sore throat persisted and on the second day of admission, she began experiencing generalized body aches. \n\nAn increase in liver enzymes prompted further testing for viral hepatitis and repeat testing for malaria. The malaria test returned positive this time, and she was started on artesunate. Due to the liver impairments, she was advised to suspend her ART. \n\nWhile her condition improved and liver enzymes began to normalize, she continued to complain of muscle aches and swelling in the body, particularly with paresthesia in the lower limbs. She was discharged on the seventh day, yet was readmitted the following day with severe headaches, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. \n\nSubsequent lab results revealed acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 183 \u00b5mol/L. Despite these complications, her condition improved over the next 5 days and she was discharged. However, she was readmitted again the same night in a hysterical state, complaining of chest pain and chills. \n\nAlthough her physical examination was unremarkable, lab tests showed highly elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium. The patient admitted to restarting her ART each time she was discharged, despite medical advice. \n\nConsidering her persistent symptoms and ART usage, an HLA-B*57:01 test was conducted, which returned positive, suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction to the abacavir component of her ART. She was advised to cease the ABC/DTG/3TC regimen. \n\nShe presented 12 days later (27 days after the initial presentation) with severe headaches and episodes of confusion. Brain CT and MRI scans revealed a left posterior parietal tuberculoma.

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Chinese man who suffered from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm underwent craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation. No problems with swallowing or speaking were reported during the surgery. Unfortunately, the patient experienced dysarthria, dysphagia, and trouble with tongue movement after the surgery. Thus, we performed a detailed neurological examination. In addition to the symptoms described above, we also found symptoms linked to cranial nerve injuries, such as a weakened pharyngeal reflex, tongue deviation toward the affected side, atrophy of tongue muscle, and so on. Further evaluations and imaging examinations were carried out. The rating of the functional oral intake scale (FOIS) was level 2. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) showed that the contrast agent leaked into the vestibule of the larynx and entered the trachea through the glottis when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid . The rating of Rosenbek leakage/aspiration scale was level 8, which is the worst level. When the patient drank 3 ml of medium-thick semi-fluid liquid, effective swallowing was not initiated and the epiglottis valley had a large amount of residue. When examined through the electronic laryngoscope, we noticed paralysis of bilateral vocal folds . All these observations indicated that the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve had been injured. Therefore, we thought that there may be a lesion in or near the brainstem that led to nerve injury. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that there were no brainstem lesions , and that the symptoms that arose after surgery could not be explained by the left frontal lobe malacia and subdural hematoma . Owing to the inconformity of symptoms and radiographic results, we decided to analyze the rare case again. When we reviewed the clinical history, we noticed that the surgery was performed under general anesthesia and transoral intubation, so there may be a connection between transoral intubation and nerve injury. After consulting with the ear\u2013nose\u2013throat (ENT) and anesthesiology departments, we excluded arytenoid dislocation and violent intubation. Then we found that these symptoms are similar to those of a specific syndrome, so we compared the characteristics of this case with diagnostic criteria of that syndrome. First, in terms of clinical history, the majority of cases occur following the surgical intervention under general anesthesia and transoral intubation. Our patient went through craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation before these symptoms arose. Second, symptoms of the patient included difficulties in tongue movement, unilateral tongue paralysis, and atrophy of the tongue, as well as hoarseness and dysphagia, which matches the described symptoms of that syndrome. Third, the complete neurological examination showed that there are cranial nerve injuries and, based on the MRI results, we excluded lesions in the brainstem. Hence the symptoms are likely caused by peripheral nerve injuries. Thus, a diagnosis was made. Fig. 1 Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). A Aspiration occurred when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid. (before treatment, arrow, left). B A small amount of leakage when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid.

B Symptoms cannot be explained by left frontal lobe malacia and subdural hematoma (arrow, right) Full size image We designed a detailed rehabilitation strategy for the patient immediately. In the previous studies of that syndrome, only standard swallowing training was used as rehabilitation treatment, which proved to be effective but still means a lengthy recovery process. So we decided to include electroacupuncture as a measure in our treatment to observe the effect. The patient received acupuncture treatment 30 minutes per day, six times per week for 52 days . Qi She brand disposable, sterile steel needles (0.25\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm; Wuxi Jiajian Medical Instrument Co. Ltd) were used. Based on our experience in treating similar diseases, we chose several acupoints to improve deglutition and speech function. These acupoints included the three-needle tongue (Shanglianquan, located in the depression between the lingual bone and the border of the lower jaw, 1 cun inferior to the midline of the jaw), and two other acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (note that the width of the interphalangeal joint of the patient\u2019s thumb is taken as 1 cun, approximately 25 mm), Dicang (ST 4, with the eyes looking straight forward, the point is vertically below the pupil, at the level of the angle of the mouth), Taixi (KI 3, in the depression between the tip of the medial malleolus and Achilles\u2019 tendon), and Zhaohai (KI 6, in the depression below the tip of the medial malleolus). Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation (EA parameters were set as follows: discontinuous wave with frequency 5 Hz, pulse width 1 ms, and intensity approximately 2 mA, until a slight jitter in the muscle is observed) was applied to two acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (EX). No side effects such as bleeding or hematoma were observed during the entire treatment. Fig. 4 The location of acupoints. Acupoints on face and neck (three-needle tongue and Dicang).

Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; the patient was referred to our department for surgery. He had hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, he had no family history of malignancy. The patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, D1+\u2009lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction in November 2019. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged 6\u00a0days postoperatively. The initial surgical specimen findings were as follows : a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200935-mm 0\u2013IIc lesion with shallow depression ranging from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature. Histopathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins that were staged IA (pT1aN0M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors, 8th edition.

The arrows show the tumor.\u00a0Lesion with shallow depression extending from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature Full size image The patient was followed-up without adjuvant chemotherapy; however, a 38\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u00a0mm soft tissue mass was noted on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach during computed tomography (CT) 2\u00a0years after the procedure. Although partial thickening of the gastric wall was seen retrospectively in a 1-year postoperative CT scan, it was reviewed within normal limits by a radiologist at that time . No evidence of recurrent metastasis was found at other sites. Fig. 2 One\u00a0year postoperatively (a), 2\u00a0years postoperatively (b). The soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach is enlarged.\u00a0The arrows show the soft tissue mass Full size image The blood test findings were as follows: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 1.8\u00a0ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), 8.5 U/mL; and soluble IL-2 receptor, 396 U/mL. Colonoscopy had been performed prior to the first surgery; hence, it was not performed again. The FDG-PET/CT findings were as follows : The soft tissue mass on the left side of the residual stomach showed moderate FDG accumulation (SUVmax, 5.25). No FDG accumulation was observed in other areas. Malignant lesions, including recurrent gastric cancer and regional lymph node metastasis, were suspected; however, qualitative diagnosis was difficult. No abnormal accumulation indicating recurrence and metastasis occurred at other sites. Fig. 3 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography.

A borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum Full size image The biopsy results were as follows: the tumor contained multiple spindle-shaped cells, and immunostaining for CD34, c-kit, desmin, S-100, and \u03b2-catenin was performed to distinguish spindle-shaped tumors; however, no significant positive findings were obtained. The biopsy specimen did not allow us to estimate the histological type of the tumor as it did not conclusively suggest a GIST, smooth myxoid, or schwannoma. Based on the above-mentioned examination results, local recurrence of gastric cancer, lymph node metastasis, a GIST, a smooth myxoid, and a schwannoma were regarded as possible differential diagnoses. Although the possibility of a benign tumor remained, a definitive diagnosis could not be made histopathologically, and moderate FDG accumulation could not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, we decided to operate for diagnostic treatment. Preoperative CT revealed a suspicious finding of splenic arteriovenous invasion; therefore, total residual gastrectomy and splenectomy were planned. The surgical findings were as follows: the abdomen was opened via a median upper abdominal incision. A 50\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u00a0mm soft tissue mass originating from the gastrojejunal anastomosis involving the spleen and splenic arteriovenous was observed on the greater curvature side of the anastomosis. Additionally, a partial invasion of the pancreas was observed. The remaining stomach, spleen, splenic artery and vein, and part of the pancreas, including the gastrojejunal anastomosis, along with the soft tissue mass, were removed as a single lump. Regarding reconstruction, only esophago-jejunal anastomosis was performed, sparing previous jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. The operation time was 279\u00a0minutes, and blood loss was 1100\u00a0mL; however, no blood transfusion was required. Pathological findings of the resected specimen were as follows : a 45\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200940-mm soft tissue mass extending from the muscularis propria to the serosa at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The tumor was a white, substantial nodule, and its growth involved the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Although fibroblasts and spindle-shaped cells were observed inside the tumor, the Ki-67 index was about 2%, and atypia was not observed. Immunostaining was positive for vimentin, desmin, and \u03b2-catenin and negative for \u03b1-SMA, S-100, CD34, c-kit, STAT6, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PgR). Based on the above, a diagnosis was made. Fig. 6 Pathological findings.  The arrows show the tumor.\u00a0Tumor growth involving anastomosis is observed (a).

    "rewritten_case": "A Japanese man in his late sixties was discovered to have an extensive type 0\u2013IIc lesion in the upper gastric body extending up to the hypogastric lesser curvature through an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Upon biopsy, the lesion was identified as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient was referred to our department for surgery. He was known to have hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but he had no family history of malignancy. \n\nThe patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, D1+\u2009lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. His recovery was smooth and he was discharged 6 days after the operation. The initial surgical specimen findings revealed a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200935-mm 0\u2013IIc lesion with a shallow depression ranging from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature. Histopathological examination disclosed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins, staged IA (pT1aN0M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors, 8th edition.\n\nThe patient was followed up without adjuvant chemotherapy. During a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan, a 38\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u00a0mm soft tissue mass was detected on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach.

Colonoscopy had been performed prior to the first surgery; hence, it was not performed again.\n\nThe FDG-PET/CT findings revealed moderate FDG accumulation (SUVmax, 5.25) in the soft tissue mass on the left side of the residual stomach. No FDG accumulation was observed in other areas. Potential malignant lesions, including recurrent gastric cancer and regional lymph node metastasis, were suspected; however, qualitative diagnosis was difficult.\n\nContrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen displayed a high, heterogenous signal on T2-weighted images and a low signal on T1-weighted images in the soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach. Slow contrast effect was noticed on contrast imaging. Other malignant lesions such as gastric cancer recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) were considered as possible differential diagnoses; however, none of the findings were typical.\n\nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings showed no mass lesions in the remnant stomach. Transgastric ultrasonography revealed a 43\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u00a0mm borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum, which was biopsied using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).\n\nThe biopsy results indicated the tumor contained multiple spindle-shaped cells.

    "original_case": "A 29-year-old white male was transported to the emergency department by ambulance after experiencing a seizure in the early morning hours in September 2018. He had experienced mild pain in his left leg 1 day earlier, but did not experience any shortness of breath or chest pain at this time. Past medical history included minor mitral valve prolapse diagnosed in adolescence and at age 18 years a left tibial tubercle fracture. The patient was a commercial airline pilot and reported an average of 18 days or 90 hour per month spent piloting. He was living in a high-altitude city at the time of symptom presentation. Family history included a cousin with epilepsy and was otherwise non-contributory. The patient was discharged after an unremarkable head computed tomography (CT) scan and was referred to neurology. Neurology ruled out epilepsy as the cause of his seizures. Additional work-up, including electroencephalogram (EEG), was within normal limits. One week after his first seizure and subsequent neurology consult, the patient presented at urgent care with left leg pain and exertional shortness of breath. No imaging or bloodwork was ordered at this time. He was discharged with an erroneous diagnosis of allergies. Later in the same month, he experienced his second seizure, again in the early morning hours, but did not seek emergent medical care. Upon a second evaluation by the neurologist, he was prescribed levetiracetam. In November 2018, the patient presented to the emergency department with 3-day history of shortness of breath, hemoptysis, left calf pain radiating to the popliteal area, and intermittent left midsternal chest pain. The patient underwent an extended period of automobile travel of approximately 20 hour duration 2 weeks prior. The patient\u2019s vitals were BP 145/88, MAP 107 mmHg, temperature 97.8 \u00b0F, HR 93, RR 16, and SaO2 of 95% on RA. Upon physical examination, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no diminished breath sounds. Cardiac auscultation revealed no gallops or murmurs. Radial and femoral pulses were normal bilaterally. No edema was found in the extremities. The neurological examination was within normal limits. Blood work and imaging were subsequently ordered. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm and a rate of 98 bpm. D-dimer was elevated, which prompted further testing. Chest CT chest with intravenous (IV) contrast showed extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism . Clot burden was identified in left and right interlobar arteries extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches without infarction or effusion. IV tPA was administered. A 4-mm lingular nodule was found on CT, and oncological work-up was recommended. Fig. 1 (Left) an axial slice from a CT of the chest obtained during the pulmonary angiographic phase of IV contrast administration demonstrates the largest site of PE in the patient, located in the left proximal interlobar pulmonary artery. (Right) a coronal view demonstrating PE located in the left proximal interlobar pulmonary artery Full size image At this time, the differential diagnosis was still broad. Trousseau\u2019s syndrome was on the differential but was ruled out. Oncologic work-up was negative for malignancy. Laboratory values were within normal limits. The patient had not experienced another seizure. Work-up included full-body CT scan, which revealed findings . Hematological profile was also within normal limits, and the findings were postulated to be the cause of the patient\u2019s clotting and was added to the differential for the underlying cause of his symptom profile. Treatment options were discussed including long-term anticoagulation therapy as a minimally invasive option and venoplasty as an invasive option. The patient wished to proceed with the more definitive option and elected to undergo endovascular venoplasty with stent placement. In March 2019, Interventional Radiology placed bilateral common iliac and right external iliac venous stents to attempt definitive treatment. Stents were placed bilaterally after Doppler flow analysis showed diminished blood flow in both left and right internal iliac veins. Post-catheterization CT with three-dimensional (3D) rendering showed placement position of and patent luminary blood flow through the stents (Figs. 3, 4). Fig. 2 CT scans in all planes with 3D rendering demonstrate severe compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. 3D rendering demonstrates associated changes of the vein underlying the artery Full size image Fig. 3 Intraoperative venograms show ballooning (left), stent deployment (middle), and completion of deployment (right).

It was deemed safe to discontinue heparin and switch to daily aspirin 4 weeks after venoplasty. Six days after discontinuation of heparin, the patient experienced another thrombotic event presenting with left leg pain and shortness of breath. Diagnostic workup, including CT, was significant for PE, and the patient was taken to the interventional radiology suite. The right popliteal vein was accessed in an integrated fashion using a six French vascular sheath. A venogram was performed. A guidewire and catheter were advanced into the common femoral veins bilaterally, and simultaneous iliac venograms were performed. Catheters were then advanced bilaterally into the common iliac stents, and IV contrast was injected. Significant thrombus was demonstrated within the right proximal external iliac vein and bilateral stented common iliac veins. The thrombus also extended proximally into the inferior vena cava (IVC) immediately above the stents as well as distally into the left femoral and popliteal veins . Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy was then performed through each access site, from the left popliteal vein through the left iliac veins and into the IVC, and also from the right external iliac vein into the IVC. Fig. 5 Venography 5 weeks post-stent placement shows stents in place complicated by severe intrastent and intravenous thrombosis extending into the inferior vena cava Full size image Following thrombectomy, 20 cm infusion length catheters were deployed bilaterally. tPA infusion was initiated through each infusion catheter. In addition, to treat the nonocclusive thrombus within the distal left femoral and popliteal veins, tPA was also infused through the access sheath at that site. All sheaths and catheters were secured to the skin, and weight-based heparin was continued. Twenty-four hours later, the patient underwent fluoroscopy which confirmed patency of the treated segments . The patient remained inpatient for monitoring for the next 24 h and was discharged home on apixaban for chemoprophylaxis. The patient tolerated the procedure without complication. Fig. 6 Venography shows patent flow 24 hours after inpatient pharmacomechanical thrombectomy Full size image The patient has since reported no additional seizures, clotting events, or emergency department visits. No other significant disorders have been found, including testing for Factor V Leiden, cancer, thyroid disorders, and patent foramen ovale. Despite the negative hematological testing, the patient remains on lifelong Coumadin in the event of an undiscovered hypercoagulopathy. The care team theorizes that the seizures resulted from hypoxia due to induced hemostasis and associated thrombotic events, the high-altitude location of his residence at the time he experienced the seizures, and shallow breathing during sleep.",

    "original_case": "The patient gave her written consent to the anonymous description and publication of her case report. We present the case of an 84-year-old Caucasian woman suffering from severe pain of the left flank of several weeks\u2019 duration. Prior to the patient\u2019s current hospitalization, as reported here, a decompression and stabilization of the lumbar and thoracic spine had been performed 2 months before in a different neurosurgical clinic. In view of the clinical results and continuing severe pain, an extension of the preexisting spinal fusion from the 4th lumbar vertebral body to the second sacral vertebral body, including a cage implantation, was recommended. The patient presented multiple preexisting conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, diabetic polyneuropathy, moderate valvular aortic stenosis, and restless legs syndrome. Further, the patient introduced herself as a member of the community of JWs. For this reason, she was transferred to the local department of anesthesiology to discuss blood-saving techniques as well as the risks accompanying the procedure, as she was not willing to receive any form of blood transfusion. After the patient\u2019s decision to undergo spinal fusion surgery, an interdisciplinary plan based on the three pillars of PBM was made to provide maximum security for the patient\u2019s outcome. Presurgical assessment Prior to surgery, the patient signed an informed consent document and was asked to decide which types of blood products would be compatible with her beliefs (Additional file 1: Table S1). Initially, the patient\u2019s hemoglobin (Hb) level was 11.5 g/dl, which could be raised to 12.6 g/dl for the day of surgery by substituting iron-II-glycin-sulfate (100 mg/d). Additionally, blood sampling was reduced to a minimum, and the surgical procedure was thoroughly and interdisciplinarily planned. Alongside with cell savage techniques, anesthetic management focused on the third pillar of PBM, aiming for cardiopulmonary optimization by using a machine learning monitoring tool and a hemodynamic goal-directed therapy (GDT) protocol. The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) was established by Edwards Lifesciences (Irvine, California, USA) and is certified in the United States and Europe for hemodynamic monitoring. It aims to predict phases of intraoperative hypotension (IOH, defined as MAP < 65 mmHg for at least one minute) up to 15 min before their onset. The scale ranges from 0 to 100%, indicating the likelihood of and remaining time to pending IOH. Our hypothesis was that unnecessary volume expansion could be avoided by using the HPI-based GDT because additional fluids would only be given when the patient would be volume responsive and simultaneously be at risk for IOH. This approach should therefore prevent unnecessary hemodilution. Induction of anesthesia, hemodynamic, and intraoperative management The patient received a standard induction of anesthesia using sufentanil (0.52 \u03bcg/kg), propofol (1.67 mg/kg), and cis-Atracurium (0.21 mg/kg). The maintenance of anesthesia was performed as total intravenous anesthesia using propofol (6\u201312 mg/kg/h) as continuous infusion and sufentanil (0.1\u20130.3 \u03bcg/kg) as intermittent bolus injection. The total duration of surgery was 425 min. To compensate for blood loss, a mechanical autotransfusion system (CellSaver\u00ae, Haemonetics Corporation, Boston, USA) was used during the whole course of surgery. For hemodynamic management, an HPI-based GDT-algorithm was used . Since unnecessary hemodilution, also in GDT-treated patients, would lead to an unfavorable outcome, especially in the presented patient, we chose a more fluid-restrictive GDT. First, before the induction of anesthesia, the baseline cardiac index (CI) as well as the stroke volume were determined by implementing an arterial line in the awake patient. If HPI was raised over 70%, hemodynamic intervention was performed according to the algorithm. More specifically, if stroke volume variation (SVV) increased over 14%, a colloid bolus injection using 100 ml of gelatin infusion (Gelafundine\u00ae, B. Braun Germany) was applied over 5 min. If HPI did not decrease, the injection was repeated until HPI declined < 80% or SVV < 14%, whichever occurred first. If HPI persistently leveled > 80% despite a successful fluid challenge (defined as SVV < 14%), CI was raised when it was below the baseline value with dobutamine (5 \u03bcg/kg/min, half dose if heart rate was raised > 100 bpm). If still no reduction of HPI could be achieved after successful fluid challenge and CI optimization, noradrenaline or theodrenaline/cafedrine (Akrinor\u00ae) was used to maintain a MAP > 70 mmHg. Fig. 1 Hypotension Prediction Index-based hemodynamic treatment algorithm. CI: Cardiac Index; HPI: Hypotension Prediction Index; MAP: Mean Arterial Pressure; SVV: Stroke Volume Variation Full size image By adhering to the GDT algorithm, a sufficient hemodynamic stability was achieved throughout the surgery. The patient received a total of 2500 ml colloid infusion, maximum rates of 0.13 \u00b5g/kg/min of noradrenaline, 0.5 ml of theodrenaline/cafedrine, and no further cardiac support medication. The patient never showed signs of low pH or negative BE despite a blood loss of 2.4 L (). It was possible to reinfuse 1007 ml of the patient\u2019s own blood that was saved by the autotransfusion system. To prevent hypofibrinolytic bleeding, tranexamic acid was infused intraoperatively, starting with a bolus of 20 mg/kg/h for 1 hour and continuing with an infusion of 4 mg/kg/h for the remaining time of surgery. Once bleeding started to intensify, point-of-care thrombelastography (ROTEM\u00ae, TEM Innovations, Munich, Germany) was used to detect coagulatory alterations, which resulted in the substitution of 3 g fibrinogen.

Her medical past history was marked by a kidney transplantation in 2001 for nephroangiosclerosis, along with malignant hypertension. Current medications included amlodipine, bisoprolol, lisinopril, tacrolimus, prednisolone (3 mg/day), linagliptine, and rosuvastatin. Since 28 months, she was also receiving flecainide (100 mg once daily) for recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. In the emergency department, her body temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, respiratory rate 34/min, heart rate 66/min, arterial pressure 131/48 mmHg, and pulsed oxygen saturation (SpO2) 67%. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lower lobes. Relevant laboratory investigations showed C-reactive protein (CRP) of 375.1 mg/L (<\u20095.0 mg/L), creatinine of 4.49 mg/dL (0.60\u20131.30 mg/dL), white blood cell count of 24,720.10^3/\u00b5L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 508 IU/L (<\u2009250 IU/L). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.41, pO2 of 57 mmHg, pCO2 of 28 mmHg, total bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, and lactate of 0.6 mmol/L. On chest X-ray examination, bilateral infiltrates predominated in the basal part of both lungs . Lung computed tomography (CT) disclosed bilateral ground-glass opacities and septal thickening . Empirical antimicrobial therapy was started with piperacillin/tazobactam and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Antihypertensive medications and flecainide were withdrawn. Because of the rapidly progressive hypoxemia, oral intubation was required for mechanical ventilation with inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) 0.80. Before antimicrobial therapy, a sputum analysis from the endotracheal aspirate failed to reveal any microorganism on direct examination, and culture remained sterile. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was also temporarily needed. Examination and cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; 73% neutrophils, 16% macrophages) were negative for mycobacteria (including atypical), bacteria, fungi, parasites and virus (multiplex PCR respiratory panel). In the serum, PCR was negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and the Aspergillus galactomannan test was negative. Immunofluorescent staining and PCR were negative on BAL. Screening for myositis-specific antibodies (and also other autoimmune disorders) was negative. Echocardiography confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic valve disease, with preserved left ventricle ejection fraction, but with a moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. An open lung biopsy was performed on intensive care unit (ICU) day 4. Intravenous methylprednisolone was started (80 mg, corresponding to 1.25 mg/kg) for 11 days, and was then shifted to 64 mg prednisolone orally. Antimicrobial therapy was definitely stopped on ICU day 6. Microscopic examination revealed a diffuse filling of alveolar spaces by fibrin balls . Culture of lung tissue remained sterile. Genotyping for cytochrome P450 2D6 was also performed and the patient was *2/*4 with a duplication for *4. This implies that the patient may be considered as an intermediate metabolizer for flecainide. Extubation was possible on ICU day 15. There was also a significant radiological improvement .",
    "rewritten_case": "A 61-year-old African woman, weighing 68 kg, was admitted to the intensive care unit with rapidly worsening dyspnea and dry cough. Her medical history was significant for a kidney transplant in 2001 due to nephroangiosclerosis and malignant hypertension. Her current medications included amlodipine, bisoprolol, lisinopril, tacrolimus, prednisolone (3 mg/day), linagliptin, and rosuvastatin. For the past 28 months, she had also been taking flecainide (100 mg once daily) for recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmia.\n\nUpon arrival to the emergency department, her vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.7\u00b0C, respiratory rate 34/min, heart rate 66/min, arterial pressure 131/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 67%. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lower lobes. Laboratory tests showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 375.1 mg/L (<\u20095.0 mg/L), creatinine of 4.49 mg/dL (0.60\u20131.30 mg/dL), white blood cell count of 24,720.10^3/\u00b5L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 508 IU/L (<\u2009250 IU/L). \n\nArterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.41, pO2 of 57 mmHg, pCO2 of 28 mmHg, total bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, and lactate of 0.6 mmol/L. A chest X-ray showed extensive bilateral infiltrates, primarily in the basal areas of both lungs. A lung CT scan disclosed pervasive ground-glass opacities and septal thickening. These findings, along with her clinical presentation and elevated white blood cell count, suggested a possible diagnosis of pneumonia, unspecified organism.\n\nEmpirical antimicrobial therapy was initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Antihypertensive medications and flecainide were discontinued. Due to rapidly worsening hypoxemia, the patient required oral intubation for mechanical ventilation with an inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) of 0.80. A sputum analysis from the endotracheal aspirate was inconclusive, as no microorganism was found on direct examination, and culture remained sterile. In addition, temporary continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; 73% neutrophils, 16% macrophages) cultures were negative for mycobacteria (including atypical), bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (multiplex PCR respiratory panel). In the serum, PCR was negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and the Aspergillus galactomannan test was negative. Despite these results, the clinical picture pointed towards pneumonia of an unspecified organism. \n\nThe patient's condition improved on ICU day 15, and she was successfully extubated. There was also a significant radiological improvement, further supporting the initial suspicion of pneumonia. Genotyping for cytochrome P450 2D6 revealed that the patient was an intermediate metabolizer for flecainide.

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old nulliparous Japanese woman visited our clinic for the first time, presenting with dull left lower abdominal pain lasting for a few weeks. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) showed a left unilocular ovarian cystic mass, measuring 60 mm, containing a solid component on the cul-de-sac of Douglas . The patient was referred to the Department of Gynecology, Nara Medical University Hospital in September 2020 for the diagnosis of ovarian tumor. The patient was a housewife with normal social, emotional, and cognitive development and had normal environmental and employment history. There was no past medical, surgical, and medication history. She had never smoked or consumed alcohol. Neurological examinations were unremarkable. Evaluation of the patient\u2019s family history revealed that her father died of lung cancer, all three of her paternal uncles succumbed to colon cancer, two paternal aunts died of gastric cancer and colon cancer, respectively, and one maternal uncle was treated for leukemia. In addition, her paternal grandfather died of gastric cancer. All three of her brothers are fine. Vital signs on admission showed a body temperature of 36.3 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 132/74 mm\u200aHg, and respiratory rate of 20/minute. She was obese (weight\u200979 kg, height\u2009158 cm, body mass index\u200931.6 kg/m\u00b2). A pelvic mass was palpated on the left side of the uterus during physical examination. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 57\u2009\u00d7\u200941\u2009\u00d7\u200939 mm cystic mass with solid component originating in the left adnexa. The cystic part is of liquid signal, the solid component had high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and had low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), with hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) . In addition, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan revealed increased FDG uptake in solid components of the tumor [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax): 19.9] . No distant metastases were detected with staging CT and FDG-PET/CT. The patient had elevated serum levels of cancer antigen (CA) 125 (89 U/mL), but CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within the normal range. Imaging studies suspected ovarian malignancy, and she received primary debulking surgery. Following surgery, the pathological evaluation revealed the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIB. The patient underwent complete cytoreductive surgery. On postoperative day 27, the patient received the first cycle of combination chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel (175 mg/m\u00b2; 3-hour infusion) and carboplatin (at a dose corresponding to an area under the curve of 5 mg/mL/minute). The patient subsequently received five cycles of standard carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Genetic analysis of peripheral blood DNA revealed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations were absent, but tissue samples from a pretreatment tumor biopsy were positive for the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test (Myriad Genetics, Inc.). The patient received oral niraparib maintenance therapy at a bolus of 200 mg daily after first-line chemotherapy. Figure 4 and  show the laboratory data. Her RBC count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count were 297\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 10.5 g/dL, 35\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b2/\u03bcL, and 21.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, respectively, when she started niraparib therapy. Immediately after the start of niraparib treatment (that is, 6 months after surgery), sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) was orally administered to treat anemia. Forty days after the start of niraparib therapy, peripheral blood cell counts, hematocrit levels, platelet counts, white blood cell count, and neutrophil count decreased to 231\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 7.8 g/dL, 9.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 18\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b2/\u03bcL, and 323/\u03bcL, respectively (). Niraparib therapy was discontinued, but hemoglobin levels were further reduced to 7.0 g/dL. The patient had transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Blood examination showed macrocytic anemia [mean corpuscular volume, 99.1 fL (82\u201398 fL); mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 33.8 pg (26\u201332 pg/mL); and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 35.1 g/dL (31\u201334 g/dL)]. Furthermore, blood tests showed high serum ferritin levels 350 ng/mL (10\u2013148 ng/mL) and reticulocyte 3.5% (0.5\u20132.0%), low serum total iron-binding capacity 260 \u03bcg/dL (263\u2013457 \u03bcg/dL), and serum levels of iron 141 \u03bcg/dL (32\u2013170 \u03bcg/dL), bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL (0.4\u20131.5 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase 190 U/L (120\u2013225 U/L), folic acid 8.0 ng/mL (2.1\u201310.1 ng/mL), vitamin B12 401 pg/mL (180\u2013914 pg/mL), and transferrin 211 mg/dL (190\u2013320 mg/dL) were in the normal range. Chest radiography, electrocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound, and thorax, abdominal, and pelvic computerized tomography were normal. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with niraparib-related anemia. Niraparib therapy was discontinued for 2 weeks, and two units of packed RBC were transfused. Thereafter, the patient resumed oral niraparib therapy at a bolus of 100 mg daily and then increased to 200 mg 2 weeks later, but immediately exhibited grade 3 anemia. The patients required two units of packed RBC transfusions twice to maintain serum hemoglobin levels above 10 g/dL. RBC transfusions, dose interruption, and dose reduction were used to manage grade 3 anemia. SFC was discontinued and changed to oral FCH after blood transfusion. She began taking oral FCH at a dose of 500 mg daily 10 months after her surgery. Niraparib therapy was maintained at a daily dose of 100 mg until the following month. After continuous administration of FCH, the peripheral blood cell counts recovered gradually with stable Hb counts fluctuating between 10.7 and 12.5 g/dL. One year after surgery, niraparib therapy is still maintained at a daily dose of 200 mg. Oral administration of FCH was discontinued because the hemoglobin level exceeded 12 g/dL. Then, the serum hemoglobin levels decreased again. However, our patient no longer required blood transfusions and Hb levels stabilized at around 10\u201311 g/dL. She resumed oral FCH therapy after 8 weeks of pause, showing efficacy again. The follow-up is ongoing, and she has never been transfused.  presents laboratory findings in this patient before and after treatment with FCH. She has survived disease-free for 25 months after initial surgery. There is no sign of radiological recurrence with a normal serum CA125 level until now. She reached a total dose of approximately 90,000 mg and 135,000 mg of niraparib and FCH, respectively. We obtained the patient\u2019s informed consent to publish this case report.",

Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion measuring 40 mm in diameter along with moderate right pleural effusion . Fig. 1 Computed tomography scan showing very large pericardial effusion and possibly reflecting the presence of cardiac tamponade. There is moderate right posterior pleural effusion Full size image There was a spiculated anterior subpleural lesion measuring 28 mm extending to the anterolateral pleural surface of the right upper lobe  and significant enlargement of the mediastinal with right paratracheal lymph node measuring 15 mm and subcarinal lymph node measuring 18 mm and left axillary lymph nodes measuring 12.5 mm. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis was carried out. Fig. 2 Computed tomography scan showing right upper lobe speculated anterior subpleural lesion extending on the anterolateral pleural surface, suggesting primary bronchial cancer Full size image The pericardial and pleural fluid cytology contained small numbers of malignant cells, presenting predominately singly in a bloodstained background. These cells have enlarged pleomorphic nuclei with granular to coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive staining of tumor cells for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), napsin A, and Cytokeratin 7 (CK7). Staining for Estrogen receptor (ER), Cytokeratin 20 (CK20), Caudal Type Homeobox 2 (CDX2), and calretinin were all negative. These findings are in support of adenocarcinoma of lung origin. In 2015, the fluid sample sent was not sufficient to undergo further testing to determine PD-L1 expression, immunohistochemistry testing for c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) / anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation, or molecular testing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). She had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 after VATS pleurodesis. The patient quit smoking at the time of diagnosis. She was then commenced on first-line chemotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 5), and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) 3 weekly at T = 1 month in February 2015. She completed four cycles with no dose reduction. Follow-up CT imaging was done 3 months later (T = 4 months) demonstrated good clinical and radiological response. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 [10], complete response was achieved with disappearance of the pleural based right upper lobe lesion. There is complete response to the mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph nodes. She was clinically well with maintenance of her performance status. Given the excellent response after first-line chemotherapy, she was then commenced on maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 every 21 days. This is based on evidence that it prolongs overall survival and progression-free survival [11]. The patient completed eight cycles of pemetrexed without significant toxicities. In December 2015, there was single lesion progression with a new right upper lobe lesion (18 \u00d7 15 mm2) . The patient declined biopsy of this lesion. Given disease progression as per RECIST version 1.1, she was commenced on nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks at around T = 12 months in February 2016 owing to emerging evidence of immunotherapy in this setting for previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Fig. 3 Computed tomography scan showing a right upper lobe lung lesion Full size image After the commencement of immunotherapy, her follow-up scan done in May 2016 showed complete response of single lung lesion as per RECIST version 1.1. Further imaging subsequently every 3 months with CT of brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis continues to show no evidence of recurrence or new metastatic disease. At T = 59 months in November 2019, she had an elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis secondary to multiple cholelithiases. Her nivolumab was not withheld during the surgery, and she did not develop any complications during the perioperative period. At T = 63 months in March 2020, somatic gene mutation analysis was requested on her previous pericardial fluid and tissue sample done early in the diagnosis as the patient was not keen for rebiopsy. Reanalysis of the sample could be done using molecular testing. A mutation was detected in the KRAS gene p.(Gly12Cys): G12C (16%). No clinically relevant mutation was found in the tested regions of EGFR, BRAF, MET, RET, or ERBB2. It was negative for rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 genes. There was high level PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 80%. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan at T = 83 months in November 2021 showed no suspicious fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake within lungs.

The cyst was well-defined, thin-walled, and measured approximately 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 cm, obstructing the foramina of Monro, resulting in hydrocephalus ventriculomegaly. \n\nThe patient underwent surgical intervention which involved endoscopic cystoventriculostomy and cystocisternostomy. The surgery was executed through a small para coronal burr hole on the right side of the skull. The endoscopic trocar identified clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that was under pressure. As the cyst was punctured, it seemed to leap toward the lens due to high intracystic pressure, which was likely balanced by the back pressure of the CSF. Many small fenestration holes were made in the anterior direction and at the bottom. By the end of the procedure, normal pulsation of the ventricle was achieved with a good flow of fluid around the remaining membrane.",

The central evaluating hub was St George\u2019s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a significant tertiary rheumatology center located in the south of England.\nA newly developed referral form for tocilizumab was put into use, and every case was discussed in a bi-weekly multidisciplinary team meeting. The data for this analysis was retrospectively collected through these referral forms and electronic patient records, supplemented by correspondence from referring clinicians and confirmation with patients themselves. The central dispensing pharmacy was situated at St George\u2019s Hospital, validating patient numbers and details.\nThe 16 patients identified consisted of 11 females and 5 males, with a mean age of 72.4 (range 61\u201382) years. Seven of these were internal referrals from clinicians at the tertiary center, while the rest were from local district general hospitals.\nTocilizumab and steroid dosing showed a dosage reduction range from 0 to 57 mg, with a mean of 20.4 mg [95% CI 13.0\u201327.8 mg] among the 15 cases for which this data was available. Notably, three of these 15 cases were entirely weaned from steroids.\nFive out of the 16 cases discontinued tocilizumab after the 12 months funded by NICE guidance, while eight additional cases continued the medication by seeking access to extra funding. Two cases (cases J and O) ceased tocilizumab entirely\u2014due to multiple side effects including nosebleeds, abnormal liver function tests, and facial rash in the former, and the unusual manifestation of ocular syphilis in the latter. The reasons for interrupted or missed doses of tocilizumab are summarized below, with 9 out of the 16 patients affected.\nBlood results and tocilizumab showed significant changes. The mean difference between ESR at presentation and before the start of tocilizumab was 22.3 [95% CI 8.2\u201336.5], and between ESR before and after the start of tocilizumab, it was 10.3 [95% CI 5.8\u201314.7].\nIn terms of C-reactive protein (CRP), the mean difference between CRP at presentation and before the start of tocilizumab was 68.2 [95% CI 12.5\u2013123.8], and the mean difference between CRP before and after the start of tocilizumab was 7.7 [95% CI 2.5\u201312.8].\nInterestingly, ophthalmic examinations revealed elevated intraocular pressure in several patients, a potential sign of glaucoma. This additional finding, coupled with the manifestation of ocular syphilis in one case, led to a reconsideration of the initial diagnosis in some cases. Indeed, the combination of systemic symptoms, steroid response, and elevated intraocular pressure could suggest a diagnosis of glaucoma. However, the true diagnosis is Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA).

    "original_case": "A 50-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of \u201cburning\u201d pain in his right foot. He had a background history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Grave\u2019s disease that required partial thyroidectomy, alcohol dependency, and a 30-pack year history of smoking. His atrial fibrillation was managed with metoprolol only, a cardio-selective beta blocker, and his thyroid function was supplemented with levothyroxine. There had been no recent new medications commenced. There was no known prior history of peripheral vascular disease or diabetes. On examination, his right foot was cool to touch without discoloration or tissue loss. He had a strong posterior tibialis pulse and an absent dorsalis pedis pulse. There was reduced sensation in both feet due to longstanding alcoholic peripheral neuropathy; lower limb motor function was intact. His left lower limb had a full complement of pulses. Doppler assessment by his bedside showed a triphasic signal over the right mid anterior tibial artery, indicating normal flow, but confirmed the absence of arterial flow through the dorsalis pedis artery on the right foot. Computerized tomographic angiography from the arch of the aorta to the lower limbs confirmed the examination findings, demonstrating patent right posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, and a right anterior tibial artery that occluded distally with no flow into the dorsalis pedis artery . The right foot vascular arch was preserved, with the main inflow being via the posterior tibial artery. There was no large vessel occlusion proximally in the thigh, and no aortoiliac abnormalities. Given the chronicity of the symptoms and investigation findings, his right foot pain was attributed to alcohol-related neuropathy and the patient was discharged from hospital with lifestyle modifying advice. Subsequently, he had presented to the emergency department on several occasions over the following few days with the same complaint. Two consecutive blood investigations including total leukocyte counts, neutrophil percentage, and hemoglobin levels were within normal values, while platelet counts on both occasions were marginally elevated at 549 \u00d7 10^9/L and 440 \u00d7 10^9/L, respectively. Furthermore, blood coagulation profiles, which included activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratios were within normal limits on both occasions. With similar examination findings to his previous admissions and normal biochemical markers, he was again discharged with analgesic medication. A week later, he was brought into the emergency department with acute confusion, bilateral foot pain, hyponatremia, and elevated inflammatory markers. This time his total leukocyte count was elevated at 18 \u00d7 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration was 119 g/L, platelet count was 350 \u00d7 10^9/L, and the hematocrit assay was 0.35/L, which remained unchanged from hematocrit values at previous visits. Likewise, coagulation profiles remained normal. A septic workup, which included a lumbar puncture, did not reveal an obvious infective cause. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were unremarkable. Lower limb venous Doppler assessment was negative for deep venous thromboses. His hyponatremia was appropriately corrected with fluid restriction resulting in resolution of confusion. However, on this occasion, he complained of worsening pain in both feet with a rapid onset of new livedo reticularis of both feet. At presentation, the working diagnosis was of a cardioembolic phenomenon in the context of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and he was commenced on therapeutic anticoagulation. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram did not show an intramural thrombus or a patent foramen ovale. Fig. 1 CT-angiography of the lower limbs demonstrating the right anterior tibial artery occluding in the distal leg (white arrow) with a patent right posterior tibial artery (yellow arrow). Note normal arteriogram of the left leg Full size image The following day, the patient\u2019s condition and limb pain worsened; he had \u201ctrash feet\u201d and new motor dysfunction of the feet. Overnight, his lower limb ischemia had worsened rapidly to the point where revascularization was no longer a viable option. A repeat CT-angiogram of the lower limbs showed absent arterial flow of contrast bilaterally below the mid-leg, with no evidence of aortic or large vessel pathology . He was deemed to have non-salvageable Rutherford Grade 3 acute limb ischemia in bilateral lower limbs below the knees. To avoid the complication of multiorgan failure that may have resulted from release of myoglobin, intramuscular potassium, and inflammatory cytokines, he underwent emergent bilateral above-knee amputations, with satisfactory improvement in his clinical status.

The red lines indicate the point of angiographic \u201ccut-off\u201d of leg blood supply Full size image A cause for his trash feet was not found prior to the operation that was empirically attributed to cardioembolic pathology. However, the indicator to search for another diagnosis of acute bilateral arterial occlusion of his leg arteries was a positive direct antiglobulin test that indicated the presence of cold agglutinins in his blood. This was performed during blood grouping before major surgical intervention. These findings led to further serological testing, including serum immunofixation electrophoresis. This indicated the presence of a monoclonal B cell population involving 32% of his total lymphocyte count, as well as a mixed IgM Kappa and IgM Lambda cryoglobulinemia, an indication for bone marrow assessment.",

Upon arrival at the facility and during the medical screening, he complained of persistent intractable epigastric pain, along with pleuritic chest pain with multiple episodes of vomiting over the previous 4 days. He further complained of dysphagia and odynophagia. At the time, he denied any past medical history and/or swallowing any foreign body. He admitted to smoking marijuana on a daily basis. During the initial care, he was given ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg tablets and 30 mg of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium solution as well as two hydroxide/simethicone tablets orally. The patient subsequently became more subjectively comfortable, but the chest pain continued to persist. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was done during the same period and was evaluated by the on-call physician as being suspicious for acute pericarditis .\n\nOn the basis of the assessment by the on-call physician, he was transferred to a local emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. In the first ED, physical examination indicated a normotensive, mildly tachycardic patient with moderate epigastric pain and otherwise normal physical examination. He admitted that his vomiting has improved but he still continues to have dysphagia. The patient underwent a series of laboratory tests that included complete blood count, serological liver function tests, a complete serum chemistry panel, and a computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. The initial laboratory findings were significant for a mild leukocytosis, and the CT revealed pericholecystic fluid, distal esophageal edema, and dilation with questionable air in the esophageal wall, and possible hiatal hernia .\n\nThe repeated EKG in the ED confirmed the possible diagnosis of pericarditis as well as concern for possible cholecystitis. Subsequently, the patient was transferred for a higher level of care to a regional medical center for further evaluation. During the course of care at the new ED, the patient continued to present with tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and persistent epigastric and chest pain. The patient\u2019s EKG continued to show diffuse ST elevation, while his cardiac markers remained within normal limits. Chest X-ray revealed a questionable infiltrate. Formal right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and showed gallbladder wall thickening near the fundus of unclear etiology but no gallstones and was otherwise normal. His laboratory results were significant for white blood cells 12.5 \u00d7 10^9 per liter, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 millimeters per hour, C-reactive protein 21.77 milligrams per decilitre, and procalcitonin 11.02 nanograms per milliliter, all elevated. Troponin and the remainder of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were grossly unremarkable.\n\nThe patient was treated with 2 liter of normal saline intravenously and 4 mg Zofran intravenously. Pain medication of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg orally as well as famotidine (Pepcid) 20 mg orally and gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail (aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/lidocaine) 30 ml orally were given. Additionally, the patient was given ceftazidime 1 g intravenously and azithromycin 500 mg orally. While in the ED, he continued to deny swallowing a foreign body or ingesting chemicals that may have caused his symptoms. Upon further review of the patient\u2019s symptoms, imaging studies, laboratory results, and recommendation by the surgery team, the patient was transferred to a nearby pediatric subspecialty hospital for further evaluation by pediatric surgery and gastroenterology and possible endoscopic evaluation of his esophagus.\n\nOn arrival to the pediatric subspecialty hospital, he continued to be tachycardic, but afebrile. In the ED, he received 4.5 gram (g) piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), 20 mg Pepcid, and 4 mg Zofran, all intravenously. He immediately underwent an esophagram with water-soluble contrast that revealed a filling defect in the distal esophagus. After further questioning by the pediatric surgery team, he admitted that he had swallowed \u201ca bag\u201d prior to his arrest but would not disclose the contents of the bag. Subsequently, he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and a plastic bag was discovered in the distal esophagus and removed .\n\nPatient was hospitalized with antibiotic therapy with intravenous Zosyn 3.375 g every 8 hours for suspected aspiration pneumonia and transitioned to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) 875 mg tablets on the third day post-procedure for an additional 7 days of treatment. The patient also continued on 20 mg oral Pepcid twice a day. Further evaluation by pediatric cardiology and repeated EKG confirmed the diagnosis of pericarditis, likely post-infectious in etiology. His esophagus also showed evidence of achalasia, which was attributed to the prolonged irritation of the epithelial surface and the inflammation in the surrounding region.\n\nWhile awaiting for the outpatient follow-up, 7 days after discharge, he returned to the local ED with persistent left-sided chest pain and dyspnea worsened with exertions and wheezing. The patient was noted to have significant leukocytosis, and a CT of his chest revealed a left-sided loculated hydropneumothorax with central cavitary lesion. He was then transferred back to the pediatric surgery service at the same subspecialty hospital for further evaluation. Given concern for esophageal perforation, a repeat esophagram was performed showing normal esophageal caliber and contour without extravasation of contrast. The patient was then admitted to pediatric service with placement of a thoracostomy tube by the interventional radiology service. He received 4 days of thrombolytic therapy via the thoracostomy with satisfactory output. The thoracostomy tube was removed 10 days later. Infectious disease was also consulted and agreed with an antibiotic regimen of intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin during his course in the hospital.",

Repeat CT imaging revealed additional ground glass opacities in the periphery of the right lung and a 6.5 mm right middle lobe nodule (Figs. 2 and 3). MRI of the lower extremities (Fig 4) showed nonspecific edema of the left distal sartorius muscle, but this finding was deemed to be nonspecific and not relevant to the patient\u2019s condition when reviewed by the musculoskeletal radiologists and the treating physicians. There was an absence of other evidence to suggest the presence of muscle inflammation. Echocardiogram and CT and MRI imaging of brain, sinuses, and spine were normal. A skin biopsy of the left palm revealed superficial mounds of parakeratosis and sparse lymphocytic inflammation, suggestive of a resolving spongiotic or psoriasiform dermatitis. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies were normal. Laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL (13.7\u201317.5 g/dL), absolute lymphocytes 1000/\u00b5L (1.3\u20133.6 1000/\u00b5L), creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) 91 IU/L (0\u201350 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 58 IU/L (5\u201334 IU/L), ferritin 920 ng/mL (12\u2013300 ng/mL), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 91 IU/L (55\u2013170 IU/L). Urinalysis was positive for trace ketones, otherwise negative for leukocyte esterase/nitrites/blood/protein. Infectious workup revealed positive M. pneumoniae IgM and negative IgG, Epstein\u2013Barr viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, and parvovirus B19 IgM. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and parvovirus B19 PCR were negative. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by nucleic acid amplification test (SARS-CoV-2 by NAAT) was negative. Two sets of anaerobic and aerobic blood cultures drawn from two separate venipuncture sites transported at room temperature had no plated growth after 5 days. No cultures for fungi were collected. Urine culture grew < 1000 colony forming units per milliliter. The patient completed 10 days of oral doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for M. pneumoniae infection without improvement. Notably, M. pneumoniae IgG subsequently turned positive.\n\nThe patient continued to have fevers, oral ulcers, arthritis, and myalgias. An antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer 1:160 with homogeneous immunofluorescence pattern and weakly positive Sjogren\u2019s syndrome-related antigen A (SSA)/anti-Ro antibody were noted. A highly positive anti-MDA5 was measured by qualitative immunoprecipitation assay on hospital day 15 and confirmed on repeat testing.",

The patient had undergone appendectomy and left inguinal hernia surgery 50 and 10 years ago, respectively. The patient has been receiving oral treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and hypertension for 5 years. At first visit, the patient\u2019s height and weight was 163 cm and 50 kg, respectively. His blood pressure was 136/80 mmHg, pulse was regular at 62 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C. He had no history of smoking or drinking, and there was nothing significant in his family history. Physical examination revealed that his right testicle was elastic, hard, and enlarged to a size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950 mm^3. No obvious lymphadenopathy on the body surface was palpable, and no gynecomastia was found. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and tumor marker levels (AFP, HCG, and LDH) showed no abnormal findings. Ultrasound findings showed a mosaic shadow inside the right testicle with no abnormal findings in the left testicle. Lung CT showed no evidence of coin lesions or effusion .

Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis, with distinct nucleoli and large nuclei, proliferating in a nest-like manner with some necrosis, and no specific differentiation tendency was observed. Vascular infiltration of tumor cells was also observed. The tumor was poorly differentiated (Fig. 2 A, B). Fig. 2 Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis; the tumor cells have distinct nucleoli and large nuclei; they proliferate in a nest-like manner with some necrosis, and no specific differentiation tendency was observed.

    "original_case": "Case 1  \nA 13-year-old Iranian boy came to our pediatric emergency department, a referral center affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, with the chief complaint of yellowish skin and two red spots on his right leg. Furthermore, his mother mentioned that he had nosebleeds for a week prior to the admission. He developed icterus 2 months before the admission, and after preliminary laboratory evaluations, which revealed elevated liver enzymes, he was diagnosed with hepatitis. One day before admission, his mother suddenly saw some petechiae-like lesions on his right leg, so she brought the boy to our center. We decided to check CBC and performed liver function tests (LFTs). His preadmission medications included folic acid 5 mg once a day and ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice a day. Physicians had prescribed these drugs because of his previous hepatitis diagnosis. On our primary physical examination, his sclera appeared icteric. He had an ulcer on his lower lip. His lungs were clear, and his heart sounds were normal. On abdominal examination, his liver seemed to be slightly enlarged. He also had evidence of ecchymosis on his right leg.  \nLaboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia on the first CBC [white blood cell count (WBC) 900/\u00b5l, hemoglobin (HB) 7.8 g/dl, platelet count (PLT) 4000/\u00b5l]. His liver enzymes were elevated [aspartate transferase (AST) 68 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 174 U/L, total bilirubin 1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.29 mg/dL, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 26 U/L] as they had been over the past 2 months. Intending to find the cause of his hepatitis, we checked for common viral hepatitis causes, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), which were all negative. We checked anti-LKM antibody (Ab), anti-dsDNA Ab, cANCA, and pANCA to rule out the possibility of autoimmune disorders, though we did not find any of them to be positive. We also checked ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels to rule out Wilson\u2019s disease, and neither was in favor of Wilson. We checked coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM, which were both negative. We also asked about his past drug history (including herbal drugs) and any potential toxin exposure, but we did not find that could have caused hepatitis. Moreover, we performed chromosome breakage test, which was negative, ruling out Fanconi anemia.  \nIn terms of his pancytopenia, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The results showed severe hypocellularity (approximately 15%), which was low for his age. Pictures of bone marrow biopsy and aspiration are shown in Fig. 1. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was done on his bone marrow sample, and there was no evidence of leukemia or lymphoma. Our treatment plan was immunosuppressive therapy (IST). The patient was started on equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (40 mg/kg/day for 4 days), prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day), and cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day). After receiving treatment, his CBC stabilized (enough to discharge the patient from hospital with further follow-up scheduled) 10 days after IST initiation, and eventually, he was discharged in good condition.  \nFig. 1  \nHypocellular smear from bone marrow aspiration revealing a few scattered myeloid cells and lymphocytes. On bone marrow biopsy, which revealed hypocellularity for his age, intertrabecular marrow spaces were shown to have been replaced by fatty cells beside the presence of some nucleated cells, including lymphocytes, plasma cells, and erythroid cells  \nFull size image  \nCase 2  \nAn 8-year-old Iranian boy was brought to our emergency department with the chief complaint of yellowish skin and abdominal distension. He was relatively well until 3 weeks prior to admission. His initial symptoms were anorexia, weakness, and fever, which led him to a medical center. Primary laboratory evaluations were done there, and he was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis on the basis of elevated international normalized ratio (INR). He also had extremely high liver enzymes. At that medical center, he had received supportive care. Then, since our hospital is the referral liver transplant center in Iran, his parents brought him to our emergency department. On initial presentation, he was severely icteric. His abdomen was distended, and ascites and hepatomegaly were observed.  \nOur initial laboratory investigations showed severe elevation of his liver enzymes (AST 1615 U/L, ALT 1880 U/L, total bilirubin 47 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 22.8 mg/dL). At that time, he also had coagulation disorder [prothrombin time (PT) 21.1 seconds and INR 2.5]. Moreover, we detected anemia and mild leukopenia in his CBC, but his platelet count was normal (WBC 2900/\u00b5l, HB 8.3 g/dl, PLT 190,000/\u00b5l). We started searching for the cause of his hepatitis. After checking viral and immunological markers, the only noticeable item we found was a positive COVID-19 IgG Ab. Like the previous patient, he did not report any history of exposure to drugs (including herbal drugs) or hepatotoxic toxins. Moreover, Fanconi anemia was ruled out for the patient by negative chromosome breakage test.  \nDuring the admission course, his situation improved and his liver enzymes began to decrease, but he suddenly developed petechiae on his left hand. So, we immediately checked the CBC, which revealed severe pancytopenia (WBC 500/\u00b5l, HB 7.1g/dl, PLT 20,000/\u00b5l). His platelet count dropped drastically. Therefore, we planned for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and the result showed severe hypocellularity, approximately 20%. Pictures of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are shown in Fig. 1.  \nSince his WBC count was very low, we could not consider a bone marrow transplant, and we decided to try immunosuppressive therapy for him, as the other patient had responded well to it. Unfortunately, after receiving the third dose of ATG, he had an episode of generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure, and he did not show any response to the treatment until that time. Hence, we stopped the chemotherapy and transferred him to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) ward. Unfortunately, he was declared brain dead, due to the low platelet number and coagulopathy.

The day before admission, his mother noticed petechiae-like lesions on his right leg and immediately brought the boy to our center. We proceeded to perform a complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests (LFTs). The patient was on a pre-admission medication regimen of folic acid 5 mg daily and ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice a day, prescribed following his hepatitis diagnosis. Physical examination revealed icteric sclera, a lower lip ulcer, clear lungs, normal heart sounds, and slight liver enlargement.

Despite extensive testing for common viral hepatitis causes, autoimmune disorders, Wilson\u2019s disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and Fanconi anemia, all results were negative. An inquiry into his past drug history (including herbal drugs) and potential toxin exposure revealed a history of prolonged use of a herbal medication, which has been associated with hepatotoxicity and bone marrow suppression in some cases.  \nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed severe hypocellularity, low for his age, with no evidence of leukemia or lymphoma.

    "original_case": "A 72-year-old Caucasian female patient, with a history of 40 years of smoking without any comorbidities presented with a non-healing, ulcerated lesion on the inner canthus of the left eye at the ophthalmology clinic. Surgical excision of the lesion was carried out in April 2008, with limited excision margins. The histological diagnosis was made. After being asymptomatic for 4 years, the tumor relapsed and the patient underwent a second surgical excision in August 2012. Resection was incomplete, with positive margins, so the patient underwent another surgery to have the tumor removed; however, histological diagnosis once again showed evidence of positive margins. Finally, radiation therapy was chosen as definitive treatment for the patient. Between December 2012 and January 2013, the patient received irradiation in 2-Gy fractions on the left halves of the forehead, glabella, nose, and on the left inner periocular eye regions. The patient attended follow-up examinations by the dermatologist every 6 months. Physical examination of the patient and an MRI scan of the affected area were carried out. The patient remained symptom free until 2018.\n\nIn June 2016, the patient presented with hematuria and was subsequently admitted to the urology clinic for cystoscopy and transurethral resection (TUR). Histological diagnosis confirmed a condition. Following surgery, the patient did not attend regular follow-up at the urology clinic, only at the dermatology clinic. Until 2018 the patient remained symptom-free.\n\nIn February 2018, the patient once again presented with hematuria at the urology clinic. First cystoscopy, then TUR was performed, and the histological diagnosis confirmed a condition, indicating the relapse and progression of the patient\u2019s tumor. Although both radical cystectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy were considered and offered as treatment options, neither was accepted by the patient.\n\nIn the weeks prior to surgery, once when the patient was blowing her nose, a cavity had spontaneously opened between the inner canthus of the patient\u2019s left eye and the medial meatus of the nasal cavity. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the facial skeleton, the cervical soft tissues, and the upper mediastinal regions was carried out in April 2018. The MRI scan showed evidence of the relapse of the condition on the skin of the inner canthus of the left eye, with the tumor invading the ethmoidal air cells in the left regions of the inner canthus and nasal root, as well as spreading into the nasal cavity and frontal sinus, cranially destroying the rhinobasis. For this advanced, locally invasive disease, the patient was given three cycles of treatment as first-line treatment without any adverse events. A follow-up MRI scan of the region, in September 2018, showed disease progression and the increased destruction of the skin in the left inner canthal region. To ascertain the histological type of the tumor, biopsy of the sinuses was carried out, which confirmed the presence of a condition. Based on the decision of the tumor board, the patient was given eight cycles of chemotherapy between January and September 2019. Follow-up MRI showed stable disease. Throughout the treatment, the patient\u2019s functional status remained ECOG 0, and no side effects were noted. Having reached the maximum cumulative dose of the chemotherapeutic agent, treatment with this agent could not be continued. Approval for a therapy was requested by the tumor board but was denied.\n\nTowards the end of her chemotherapy, in the summer, the patient felt a small lump appear in her left inguinal region, so computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in September 2019 at the urology clinic. Although local recurrence of the condition could not be found, lymph node conglomerates could be detected in the aortic and left parailiac regions, and a soft tissue lesion in the left adrenal gland raised the possibility of a condition. Ultrasound core biopsy was performed from the left suprainguinal lymph node conglomerates, with the subsequent histological diagnosis confirming the metastasis of the condition.\n\nIn November 2019, the patient was referred to the National Institute of Oncology for further oncological treatment. Taking into account the recently completed chemotherapy for the patient\u2019s advanced condition as well as the metastasis of the condition, the tumor board recommended the administration of a therapy.\n\nBetween December 2019 and 2020, the patient was given cycles of treatment. Although not a requirement for second-line therapy, staining was carried out for tissue samples from both types of cancer. The sample tested positive for a marker, with a percentage of expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells, while the sample from the lymph node metastasis showed 0%.\n\nThe patient tolerated treatment well; she did not experience any adverse or side effects. Her blood tests were normal, and her performance status remained good (ECOG 0) throughout the treatment. Follow-up abdominal, chest, and pelvis CT scans in both February and June 2020 showed the regression of the lymph node conglomerates, while the lesion in the left adrenal gland remained stable, altogether indicating the regression of the patient\u2019s condition. Response to therapy was evaluated according to the criteria. CT scans of these regions showed evidence of complete remission in September and later on in December 2020 as well. Follow-up MRI scan of the facial skeleton and cervical region in September showed evidence of stable disease.\n\nOn 30 January 2021, the patient presented with symptoms of dehydration and arrhythmia at the emergency department. She was diagnosed with a condition, and was found to be COVID-19 positive. Over the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, she developed bilateral pneumonia, became somnolent and died. The cause of her death was considered to be due to the complications of COVID-19 infection.",

Despite having no comorbidities, she had a history of a similar lesion, which was surgically excised. Unfortunately, the tumor relapsed, prompting subsequent surgeries, all of which resulted in incomplete resections. Eventually, radiation therapy was chosen as definitive treatment and delivered to the left halves of her forehead, glabella, nose, and left inner periocular eye regions. Regular follow-ups were established with dermatology, which included physical examinations and MRI scans of the affected area.\n\nDuring an unknown period, the patient developed hematuria and was admitted to the urology clinic for cystoscopy and transurethral resection (TUR). A histological diagnosis confirmed a condition, however, the patient didn't maintain regular follow-ups at the urology clinic, only at the dermatology clinic.\n\nIn a different period, the patient once again developed hematuria and underwent both cystoscopy and TUR, which confirmed the relapse and progression of the tumor. Despite this, the patient refused both radical cystectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy as treatment options.\n\nBefore one of her surgeries, the patient had an unexpected cavity open between the inner canthus of her left eye and the medial meatus of the nasal cavity while blowing her nose. This prompted an MRI scan of her facial skeleton, cervical soft tissues, and upper mediastinal regions. The scan showed relapse of the condition on her skin, extensive invasion of the tumor into the ethmoidal air cells, nasal cavity, and frontal sinus, and significant destruction of the rhinobasis. She was given cycles of chemotherapy treatment and follow-up MRI scans showed stable disease. Approval for a different therapy was requested but denied.\n\nDuring her chemotherapy treatment, the patient noticed a lump in her left inguinal region. CT scans of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis were carried out, revealing lymph node conglomerates and a soft tissue lesion in the left adrenal gland, suggesting a condition. An ultrasound core biopsy from the left suprainguinal lymph node conglomerates confirmed metastasis.\n\nThe patient was then referred for further oncological treatment, taking into account her recently completed chemotherapy and the metastasis. She was given additional cycles of treatment, which she tolerated well. Follow-up CT scans showed regression of the lymph node conglomerates and stability of the lesion in her left adrenal gland.\n\nEventually, the patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of dehydration and arrhythmia. She was diagnosed with a condition and tested positive for COVID-19.

He had a febrile illness with coryzal symptoms for 3 days, which had resolved 2 days prior to this presentation. There was no history of foreign-body aspiration or trauma. He was born to non-consanguineous parents at term and had an uneventful neonatal period. He did not have any previous hospital admissions or recurrent wheezing episodes and was developmentally normal. On examination, the child was afebrile and not pale or cyanosed. His weight was 8.8 kg (between \u22121SD and \u22122SD), and his length was 82 cm (between median and +1SD). He had moderate respiratory distress with subcostal, intercostal, and suprasternal recessions, and his respiratory rate was 50 breaths per minute. He had a loud expiratory grunt. The chest expansion was reduced on the right side, which was dull to percussion. Auscultation revealed a marked reduction of air entry over the lower and mid zones of the right chest; there were no added sounds. His arterial oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a pulse rate of 140 per minute and blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg. The apex was felt at the fifth intercostal space lateral to the midclavicular line, and his heart sounds were normal. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. Urgent chest X-ray performed due to lateralizing physical signs showed a well-demarcated opacity involving the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax associated with a tracheal shift to the opposite side . The right heart and diaphragmatic borders were obliterated. Ultrasound scan of the chest revealed fluid-filled right hemithorax suggesting a septate pleural effusion. His full blood count revealed white cell count of 17,000/mm3 (neutrophils 7300/mm3, lymphocytes 8100/mm3, eosinophils 300/mm3), hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 607,000/mm3. His C-reactive protein was 10.5 mg/L. His serum electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were normal. He was treated for a possible right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic pleural effusion with intravenous cefotaxime 50 mg/kg 8 hourly.

This showed a large multiloculated extrapulmonary cystic lesion involving the right hemithorax with a mediastinal shift towards the left side. This was associated with the displacement of the right-side mediastinal structures, including superior and inferior vena cava, narrowing of the right main pulmonary artery, and compression of the right lung superiorly. The lung parenchyma was normal. The CT appearance was in favor of a benign cystic lesion in the mediastinum. The echocardiography was normal.

On admission, initial examination revealed continuous, uncontrolled spasms of the right arm and leg. The patient relied on maximum assistance or was dependent on 2+ helpers for all aspects of self-care. For functional mobility, he required a supervisor/touch assistance for bed mobility, and partial to maximum assistance for transfers.  \nThe patient initially presented to the hospital 6 weeks prior for elevated blood glucose levels in the range of 400\u2013500. The patient did not require intubation and did not have any altered mental status during the hospital course. At the time of discharge, his blood glucose was controlled but his wife stated that, upon returning home, they remained elevated in the 400\u2013500 range. Notably, with the patient\u2019s history of anxiety and depression, he had been started on quetiapine 50 mg nightly earlier in the year, which was subsequently changed to olanzapine 7.5 mg prior to this admission.  \nThe patient had another hospital admission 2 weeks prior with 2-day history of involuntary movements in his right upper and lower extremities. He was evaluated with brain CT, MRI, and EEG and was discharged on haloperidol 5 mg twice daily for his symptoms. EEG was negative for epileptic waveforms, while CT and MRI findings were consistent with changes of nonketotic hyperglycemia. During this admission, laboratory values were positive for mild leukocytosis, blood glucose level of 125 mmol/L, and an A1C of 14.6%. Blood workup for secondary causes of hemichorea was unremarkable. The patient was admitted under the neurology service and was started on clonazepam 2 mg TID and quetiapine 25 mg TID for his symptoms, though with little improvement. Endocrinology was consulted for control of his blood glucose, and he was started on Lantus and sliding scale insulin therapy before discharge to the acute rehabilitation hospital.  \nDuring his 2-week-long admission at the rehabilitation hospital, the patient received daily focused therapy while proper blood glucose control was maintained. He was evaluated by a neurologist, who planned to place him on tetrabenazine which would be started 2\u20133 weeks after insurance approval. At the time of his discharge, significant improvements in all aspects of self-care, bed mobility, and transfers were appreciated. The patient received a follow-up MRI scan with and without contrast 3 weeks after discharge, which showed continued signal abnormality in the left lentiform nucleus with development of signal in the left caudate nucleus . Palliative care was consulted, and at a subsequent visit, symptoms continued to improve with right-sided leg movements drastically decreased. Speech was also noted to be clearer with the patient able to express himself more fluently. The patient was walking with the use of his walker and able to perform his own ADLs.

She was initially admitted to a level 1 tertiary center with 3-day history of involuntary upper and lower extremity movements that progressively worsened with generalized weakness compromising her ability to grasp utensils and ambulate. There were no associated symptoms of headache, fever, weight or appetite change, loss of consciousness, blurred or double vision, dysphagia, or numbness. Furthermore, there were no recent medication changes. One month prior, she had been admitted for encephalopathy, with hyperglycemia greater than 700 and MRI imaging with diffuse low T2 signal in bilateral basal ganglia .  \nAripiprazole 5 mg twice a day was started and continued during her rehabilitation admission. Glucose levels were tightly controlled and maintained under 200 except for three isolated episodes over her 14-day rehabilitation stay. She was admitted to inpatient rehabilitation to work with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to work on her deficits (). Prior to this, she was independent with ADLs, transfers, and mobility. Both of her physical and occupational therapy evaluations noted choreiform movements while sitting at the edge of the bed and at rest in the bilateral upper extremities that decreased with volitional movement; dystonia was present in static standing in the right lower extremity. Speech therapy noted a mild to moderate dysarthria with reduced speech intelligibility. Choreiform movements, dystonia, cognitive deficits, and dysarthria with reduced speech intelligibility were her main barriers in therapy.  \n Improved functional independence measures from admission to discharge for a 78-year-old Haitian female patient from case 2.  \nFull size table  \nPhysical therapy techniques used for chorea and dystonia included volitional movements (that is, grabbing or holding a cup of water); cognitive distraction, prolonged exhalation, meditation; ambulation and weight bearing; balance in parallel bars; visual feedback using mirrors; gait training with and without an assistive device. Occupational therapy techniques for chorea and dystonia included energy conservation techniques using figure-4 technique; endurance exercises including ergometer; deep vibration with noted reduction in chorea movements; mass practice task consisting of grasping and transferring rings from right to left with hand over hand; functional grasp tasks; visual feedback to increase standing unsupported tolerance in preparation for ADLs participation; Sander box with 3-pound dumbbell using mirror as visual feedback; Nu Step reciprocal stepper for gross motor coordination and activity endurance.

It is noteworthy that the patient reported having chronic lumbar pain for the past 3 months, yet the last few weeks were marked by hyperalgesia without a history of trauma. She complained of night sweating but had no fever, chills, cough, or dyspnea. However, the patient recalled a 1-week history of fever 1 month ago, after taking the second dose of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. She was admitted to the hospital on the same day, and was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases for adequate investigation and management. The patient was known to have hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism\u2014all treated with medications. She also had a history of lumbar L4\u2013L5 disc herniation, for which arthrodesis was performed 4 years ago. She reported a history of unpasteurized dairy product consumption. Owing to the fact that Lebanon is an endemic area for brucellosis, the presence of chronic symptoms with a recent exacerbation shed light on the plausibility of infection with spinal involvement. On physical examination, her temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure 150/80 mmHg, and pulse 105 beats per minute. We noted a painful percussion of the lumbar spine at L3/L4 as well as painful passive mobilization and lumbar paravertebral tenderness. No lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly could be observed. On neurological examination, the range of motion was not decreased for lower extremities; neither sensory deficits nor sphincter abnormalities were present. The performed blood tests were indicative of inflammation: hemoglobin 9.4 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm per hour, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 70 mg/l. White blood cell count was 6410/\u03bcl, and leukocyte formula showed 56% neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes, and 7% monocytes. Blood chemistry was within the normal values. Bacterial serology indicated that anti-antibodies were positive at a titer of 1/5120 (reference range 1/180). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed on 9 July 2021, revealed a multifocal spondylodiscitis involvement of the T12\u2013L1 and L3\u2013L4 discs and their respective adjacent vertebral bodies, with epidural thickening, significant foraminal narrowing at L3\u2013L4 level, and the formation of a paravertebral abscess of 9 mm next to T12. No nerve root compression lesions of the spine were identified. The MRI also showed a grade I anterolisthesis (spondylolisthesis) at L4\u2013L5 (Figs. 1, 2, and 3).

    "original_case": "An 89-year-old Caucasian woman accidentally drank a sip of a chemical while visiting her laundry, which had been carelessly poured into a bottle of water. Her medical record included a surgical aortic valve replacement, triple coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and arterial hypertension. The family described her as being completely autonomous at home, as proved by the fact that she worked in her own dry cleaning shop until the age of 88. The exact amount of ingested chemical is still uncertain owing to the high variability of product concentration and the proprietary formulas used by the different brands. However, the patient later described having just a sip before realizing, based on the taste, that it was not water. Around 10 minutes after ingestion she became drowsy and the emergency medical service was activated by her relatives. When she arrived at the emergency room, approximately 50 minutes after the ingestion, her vitals were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, SpO2 96%, respiratory rate of 34 breaths/minute with a snoring breathing, heart rate of 51 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. The first blood-gas analysis did not show relevant abnormalities: pH of 7.38 and lactate 2.4 mmol/L. The poison control center was immediately contacted and promptly provided the available information regarding the chemical toxicity: it is not caustic; it is a fat-soluble product, which tends to accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS); its half-life is extremely variable and uncertain in humans, with an estimated biological half-life of 144 hours; and its immediate life-threatening aspects are CNS and respiratory drive depression, and risk of cardiac arrhythmias, possibly owing to myocardial sensitization to endogenous and exogenous catecholamines. No antidote is available for the chemical. Characteristics of the chemical intoxication are summarized in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overview of chemical characteristics and toxicity Full size image The sudden and deep CNS depression led the whole team to presume that a large quantity of the chemical had been ingested and that its effects on the CNS could presumably last for several days. This scenario would have led to prolonged mechanical ventilation, a long intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and a high risk of ICU-related complications, especially considering the patient\u2019s advanced age. After a team evaluation, the patient was intubated and admitted to the ICU. Intubation was devoid of any complication; however, the patient developed severe hypoxemia, with the need to increase FiO2 up to 1. After 4 hours of mechanical ventilation, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was 70 mmHg with an FiO2 of 0.6 [ratio between partial pressure of oxygen and FiO2 (PaO2:FiO2) of 117]. Oxygenation improved in the following 3\u20134 hours, reaching an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 155 mmHg at FiO2 of 0.6 (PaO2:FiO2 of 258). The patient showed some hemodynamic instability and required fluid resuscitation with 3000 ml of crystalloids infused over the first 4 hours. The concentration of lactate was rapidly normalized and the patient had a normal urinary output. Five hours after the accidental ingestion, two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia occurred, promptly terminated with adenosine. Initially, the patient remained comatose, with a GCS of 3. During the observation in the ICU, her neurological condition started to improve and the patient suddenly woke up and self-extubated herself 12 hours after the ingestion (3 a.m.). Her respiratory function had recovered, she could cough properly and was completely awake. At 8 a.m., her vital signs were as follows: SpO2 98% with 2 L/minute nasal oxygen, respiratory rate of 17 breaths/minute, heart rate of 70 beats/minute despite a brief and self-limiting episode of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 145/50 mmHg, and urinary output 1400 ml from hospital arrival. Less than 24 hours after ingestion she was discharged from the ICU, and 4 days later she was discharged from the hospital. No signs of liver or renal failure appeared, and the only complication during her hospital stay was a single episode of blood in the sputum. A blood and urine sample taken immediately after the discharge from the ICU was sent to the forensic toxicology department of the University of Milano for a quantitative measurement of the chemical. The results were as follows: blood concentration 9.45 ng/ml and urine concentration 25.5 ng/mg.",
    "rewritten_case": "An 89-year-old Caucasian woman was reported to have accidentally ingested a chemical while at her laundry shop, which was mistakenly poured into a water bottle. The patient had a medical history of surgical aortic valve replacement, triple coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and arterial hypertension. She lived independently at home and had been actively working in her own dry cleaning shop until the age of 88. The exact chemical and its concentration remain uncertain due to the variability of products used in dry cleaning and their proprietary formulas. The patient admitted to taking a sip before realizing it was not water, based on the taste. Approximately 10 minutes post-ingestion, she started feeling drowsy, leading her family to call the emergency medical service.\n\nUpon arriving at the emergency department, about 50 minutes after the incident, her vitals were recorded as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, SpO2 96%, respiratory rate of 34 breaths/minute with a snoring breathing, heart rate of 51 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. Initial blood-gas analysis showed a pH of 7.38 and lactate 2.4 mmol/L, with no significant abnormalities. \n\nThe poison control center was consulted for information on the chemical toxicity. They reported that the chemical was not caustic and fat-soluble, with a tendency to accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS). Its half-life was highly variable and uncertain, with an estimated biological half-life of 144 hours. The immediate life-threatening aspects included CNS and respiratory drive depression, and potential cardiac arrhythmias due to myocardial sensitization to catecholamines. There was no known antidote for this chemical.\n\nBased on the patient's sudden and severe CNS depression, the team speculated a large dose ingestion, which could result in prolonged effects on the CNS. This could lead to extended mechanical ventilation, a long intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and high risk of ICU-related complications, particularly given the patient\u2019s advanced age. A decision was made to intubate the patient and admit her to the ICU.\n\nFour hours post-intubation, the patient showed severe hypoxemia, needing an increase in FiO2 up to 1.

She had two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, treated with adenosine. \n\nHowever, an unexpected finding was noticed in the lab results. The patient's blood sample showed a high concentration of trichloroethylene, a common industrial solvent. This finding, unusual in the setting of a dry cleaning shop, raised queries about the actual source of the chemical. \n\nDespite remaining comatose initially with a GCS of 3, the patient's neurological status improved, and she woke up and self-extubated 12 hours post-ingestion. Her respiratory function recovered, and she was fully alert. At 8 a.m., her vitals were stable, and by the next day, she was discharged from the ICU. She was discharged from the hospital 4 days later with no signs of liver or renal failure. The only complication during her stay was a single episode of blood in her sputum. \n\nA blood and urine sample taken immediately after discharge from the ICU was sent for toxicology testing. The results showed blood concentration 9.45 ng/ml and urine concentration 25.5 ng/mg of the ingested chemical. The high level of trichloroethylene, in conjunction with the unusual circumstances of the incident, led to a suspicion of possible intentional exposure, prompting a further investigation into the case.",

    "original_case": "A 1-year old Pakistani origin male child with Down\u2019s syndrome, presented with gradual enlargement of the head, and developmental regression over the last few months. He was born at 38 weeks via vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy to nonconsanguineous parents (mother 33 years old, and father 38 years old). His birth weight was 2.95 kg, length was 52 cm, and head circumference was 35 cm. His Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score was 7 at 1 minute, and 10 at 5 minutes. Down\u2019s syndrome was diagnosed soon after birth, based on typical facial features and presence of palmar crease, and later confirmed karyotypically for Trisomy 21. His two siblings, aged 6 and 4 years, were alive and healthy. Further social and family history was unremarkable. From a growth standpoint, at birth, he was 10th percentile for weight and 25th percentile for length. At both 6 months and 1 year, he was 25th percentile for weight and 50th percentile for length. His head circumference was 50th percentile at birth, at 6 months it was at 97th percentile, and at 1 year when he presented to the clinic, it was 20 standard deviations (SD) above the 99th percentile. From a growth milestone standpoint, at 9 months, he smiled and laughed at \u201cpeek-a-boo,\u201d lifted arms up to be picked up, crawled, and sat up without support. However, at 12 months, his parents noticed that he cried more, stopped responding to his name, and preferred to lay flat rather than crawl or sit. He was also less vocal and less interested in toys. On physical examination, he appeared to have macrocephaly, along with signs of Down\u2019s syndrome including flat nasal bridge, upward slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthic folds, and simian crease. He appeared to be mildly irritable. Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal, genitourinary, and integumentary examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed intact cranial nerves and sensations to noxious touch. However, there was generalized muscular hypotonia with muscle wasting, with \u22122 bilateral knee and ankle reflexes, and bilateral upgoing plantars. His initial blood tests did not show any abnormality. His hemoglobin (Hb) was 11.5 g/dL and white blood count (WBC) was 13 \u00d7 10^9/L with normal differential. His liver and renal functions were within normal limits. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were also within normal limits. Hepatitis B and C serology were negative. Urinalysis and chest X-ray also did not show any abnormality. He was admitted, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a large cystic tumor in the right parieto temporo occipital regions . Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast showed a 10.9 \u00d7 11.4 \u00d7 8.9 cm, heterogeneously enhancing, mixed solid and cystic supratentorial mass, with surrounding vasogenic edema in the right parieto temporo occipital lobe. The solid component was dural based, measuring 6.4 \u00d7 6.0 cm, showing heterogeneous intensity on T2W imaging with marked enhancement on post-contrast images. There was a midline shift towards the left, with compression on the ipsilateral right lateral ventricle. Moderate obstructive hydrocephalus was also noted (Figs. 2, 3).\n\nFig. 1 A, B Pre-operative CT without contrast: Axial images show a mixed density heterogeneously enhancing mass in the Right posterior parieto temporo occipital locations (red arrows) Full size image Fig. 2 Pre-operative MRI without contrast. A\u2013C Axial T2 W/T1W/FLAIR images show a heterogeneous intensity mass (red arrow shows solid component), (red arrowhead shows the cystic component) in the right parieto temporo occipital location compressing ipsilateral lateral ventricle causing a mild midline shift.

Removal of the posterior dural-based solid mass was omitted due its attachment to the highly vascular dura mater. Postoperative course was uneventful. The tumor specimen was sent for histopathological examination, which revealed low cellularity with intervening bands of fibrous tissue and collagen fibers. Neoplastic cells had a high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio with hyperchromatic nuclei. Some areas showed hypercellular pleomorphism, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation. Some cells with rhabdoid morphology were also present with abnormal mitosis . Staining was performed for integrase interactor 1 (INI-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), desmin, creatine kinase (CK), synaptophysin, and Ki-67. INI-1 came out strongly positive, ruling out atypical teratoid and rhabdoid tumors. A large proportion of tumor cells were positive for GFAP  and negative for synaptophysin, desmin, and CK. Ki-67 index was low in the majority of the tumor. However, areas with increased cellularity had raised Ki-67 to 50%. Morphology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis, which correlated with clinical and radiological findings. Further molecular studies were not done.\n\nFig. 4 A Low-power view highlighting collagenized septa with small cell population having high N/C ratio. B High-power view showing scattered cellular foci with pleomorphism and increased mitotic activity (blue/black arrow) Full size image Fig. 5 Immunohistochemistry.

D High Ki-67 index in areas with increased cellularity Full size image \n\nA postoperative CT was done that showed removal of the major bulk of the tumor. A residual mass (3.1 \u00d7 1.3 cm on axial images) was seen adherent to the dura of posterior interhemispheric fissure . The patient was subsequently discharged home. At follow-up at 6 weeks, his mother reported gradual functional improvement, along with recovery of motor milestones evidenced by his ability to sit with support, and return of moderate hand grip.\n\nFig. 6 A, B Postoperative CT without contrast: A major bulk of the tumor had been removed with a small enhancing dural residual mass (2.9 \u00d7 1.3 cm on axial images) adherent to posterior interhemispheric fissure (red arrows).

This mass was adherent to the posterior interhemispheric fissure, as well as the tentorium cerebelli (Figs. 7, 8). Keeping in view this extremely rare presentation with growing residual mass adherent to the dura, prospective treatment options were discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board. With recurrence after the initial surgery, the parents were nonconsenting for further surgical intervention, and chose chemotherapy in the hope of controlling further tumor growth and halting subsequent functional decline.\n\nFig. 7 Two months postoperative MRI without contrast.

In the day prior to presentation, she exhibited disorganized speech and delusions that her mother was going to die. In the emergency department, she was overinclusive and talking nonsensically. She was paranoid of security staff, endorsed auditory hallucinations, believed she was at a \u201cs\u00e9ance,\u201d and appeared to be responding to internal stimuli. Consequently, she was admitted to psychiatry for further workup and management. Of note, an emergency physician noted organized speech when she was initially seen, though this was not observed by the psychiatry team.\n\nHer thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at the time of admission was 123.90 mIU/L (reference range 0.20\u20134.00 mIU/L). Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood glucose, and creatinine were all normal. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swab was negative. The patient was on no medications prior to admission and had no history of hypothyroidism or other medical conditions. She had previously been prescribed stimulant medications for ADHD but had not taken any stimulants for months owing to previous intolerance. She denied any substance use, including alcohol and nicotine, leading to her presentation, and urine toxicology screen was negative for amphetamines or other substances.\n\nThe patient was living alone in an apartment prior to being brought to hospital. She had a boyfriend and no children. She was unemployed at the time of admission but was to start a new job working with immigrants. Her mother had a history of hypothyroidism, and the patient was not sure if she had any other family history of thyroid or autoimmune disorders. No family history of other conditions was identified.\n\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms fluctuated when she was seen the day following admission. She initially was more organized and was able to describe experiencing persecutory and religious delusions in the week prior to admission. Nonetheless, she continued to experience delusional beliefs that her mother was going to die. Later in the day, she was noted to be more tangential and was unable to answer questions.\n\nWhen seen by the endocrinology consult team, the patient reported experiencing cold intolerance, fatigue, dry skin, poor appetite, and hair loss. She did not notice any weight gain. She reported feeling her voice was weaker and that she felt like she had a frog in her throat. The patient reported that she had previously been diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis but that this had not been felt to be sufficiently severe to require treatment at that time. While documentation from a previous assessment is unavailable, the patient was noted to have an elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase result (67.1 kIU/L, reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L) approximately 5 years prior, with TSH within normal limits, and this may have been why she had been evaluated as not requiring treatment. On physical examination, she had a slightly enlarged thyroid gland, hyperreflexia, and mild tremor. Notably, delayed relaxation or diminished deep tendon reflexes are typically observed in previous case reports, and it is unclear why hyperreflexia and mild tremor were observed on physical examination in this case. It is possible that this finding was erroneous; however, further description of findings in cases may provide more clarity. Cardiac examination was unremarkable, and no nail changes were observed. Additional blood work showed decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) of 0.9 nmol/L (reference range 1.1\u20132.8 nmol/L), free T3 of 2.8 pmol/L (reference range 3.5\u20136.5 pmol/L), and free thyroxine (T4) of 4.6 pmol/L (reference range 10.0\u201325.0 pmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies were elevated at 147.6 kIU/L (reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L). Anti-thyroglobulin antibody and thyroglobulin levels were within normal limits. Neck ultrasound described a heterogeneous, hyperemic, non-enlarged thyroid gland with hypoechoic nodules abutting the posterior aspect and inferior aspects of the thyroid gland.",
    "rewritten_case": "A Caucasian woman in her early 40s, with a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression, was admitted to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of anxiety and severe sleep disturbance. Throughout her stay, she had periods of disorganized speech and was paranoid of security staff. She had auditory hallucinations and was under the delusion that she was participating in a \u201cs\u00e9ance.\u201d She also believed that her mother was going to die and seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. She was subsequently admitted to the psychiatry department for further evaluation and treatment. Interestingly, an emergency physician noted organized speech in the early phase of her hospital stay, although this was not observed by the psychiatry team.\n\nUpon admission, her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were significantly elevated at 123.90 mIU/L (reference range 0.20\u20134.00 mIU/L). Other lab results including complete blood count, electrolytes, blood glucose, and creatinine were within normal ranges. She tested negative for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The patient was not on any medications at the time of admission and had no prior history of hypothyroidism or other medical conditions. She had ceased taking her prescribed stimulant medications for ADHD due to intolerance. She denied any substance use, including alcohol and nicotine. A urine toxicology screen was negative for amphetamines or other substances.\n\nThe patient resided alone and was unemployed at the time of hospitalization but had plans to start working in a job assisting immigrants. She had a boyfriend and no children. Her mother had a history of hypothyroidism, and she was unsure about any other family history of thyroid or autoimmune disorders. No other family medical history was noted.\n\nObservations of the patient\u2019s symptoms varied. At one point, she was more organized and described having religious and persecutory delusions. However, she continued to hold the delusion that her mother was going to die. On other occasions, she appeared more tangential and had difficulty responding to questions.\n\nUpon consultation with the endocrinology team, the patient reported experiencing a variety of symptoms including cold intolerance, fatigue, dry skin, poor appetite, and hair loss. She did not report any weight gain. She also mentioned a weaker voice and the feeling of having a frog in her throat. The patient disclosed a previous diagnosis of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, which had not been considered severe enough for treatment at the time. Past blood work indicated elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase levels (67.1 kIU/L, reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L) with TSH within normal limits, which might have contributed to the decision not to initiate treatment. Upon physical examination, she had a mildly enlarged thyroid gland, hyperreflexia, and tremor. Cardiac examination was unremarkable, and no nail changes were observed. Further blood tests showed decreased total triiodothyronine (T3), free T3, and free thyroxine (T4) levels. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies were elevated.

She also suffered from depression after the recent death of her husband. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, while she presented with rectal tenesmus and pain on defecation. At the very beginning, she had hematochezia and mucus leakage, while in the following days she developed severe constipation. Endoscopy and endorectal echography confirmed the clinical suspicion of a severe proctitis . Upon admission, platelet count was already very low (30 \u00d7 10^9), and for this reason no antithrombotic prophylaxis was given. Local anti-inflammatory treatment was prescribed. Three days later, her clinical condition deteriorated, with the patient appearing confused without focal neurological deficits. \n\nFig. 1 Colonoscopy showing severe proctitis with ulceration of the mucosa Full size image\n\nBlood tests revealed acute kidney injury [AKI stage 2 according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), creatinine 251 \u03bcmol/L], severe thrombocytopenia (10 \u00d7 10^9/L), and hemolytic anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 71 g/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 8618 U/L, negative Coombs test, schistocytes in blood smear; Fig. 2]. The clinical presentation was consistent with TMA. Since thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) could initially not be excluded, we administered high-dose corticosteroids and started plasmapheresis. As soon as ADAMTS13 levels turned out to be normal, plasmapheresis was stopped, and corticosteroid treatment was rapidly reduced and stopped. Serological screening for autoimmune diseases was negative (antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) screen, and antibodies associated with anti-phospholipid syndrome). Drug-induced HUS was excluded since no drugs were identified known to cause drug-induced TTP. Complement and anti-factor H activity were within normal limits. Imaging, which encompassed cerebral, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, and chest X-ray did not reveal any lesion evocative for neoplasm or alternative explanations for the neurological symptoms. The patient was up to date on breast and uterine cancer screenings, and a full colonoscopy was performed. Microbiological analysis, including viral serologies and repeated blood cultures, was negative. Fecal cultures were positive for Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli. \n\nFig. 2 Blood smear at diagnosis: polychromasia. Schistocytes and microspherocytes, suggestive of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia Full size image\n\nSupportive care was implemented with careful volume management to control AKI, and red blood cell transfusions were required to maintain a hemoglobin level > 80 g/L. In the following days, her clinical condition progressively improved with complete regression of the neurological symptoms, renal function fully recovered, and hemoglobin and platelet counts improved (hemoglobin 93 g/L, thrombocytes 62 \u00d7 10^9/L, creatinine 206 \u03bcmol/L). A few days later (day 15 of hospitalization, Fig. 3), we observed a new deterioration of the platelet count (thrombocytes 20 \u00d7 10^9/L) and the patient developed posterior tibial vein thrombosis despite prophylactic doses of heparin. The case was reevaluated because of the unexpected clinical evolution: several differential diagnoses were considered, including a relapse or drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. \n\nFig. 3 Platelet counts over time Full size image\n\nMoreover, post-transfusion purpura was considered as an alternative diagnosis, but was not a major concern because red blood cell units transfused were washed to avoid exposure to platelet membranes. Since heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was among the top differential diagnosis (4Ts preclinical score of 6 points), heparin was switched to argatroban. Antibodies to platelet factor 4 turned out to be positive, and heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay confirmed the diagnosis of HIT. Argatroban was continued for a total of 4 weeks, and afterwards we switched to apixaban according to current guidelines.",

She took multiple medications, including ivabradine 5 mg twice daily for symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia, with a baseline heart rate around 110 bpm. After noticing a recent drop in her HR to 50 bpm, she discontinued her ivabradine 10 days prior to presentation. Her heart rate remained in the 50\u201355 bpm range prior to presentation. On arrival, she was afebrile, HR was 55 bpm, BP was 92/55 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Orthostatic vitals were normal, and her physical examination was unremarkable other than a bradycardic pulse with regular rate. Her electrocardiogram (ECG)  demonstrated an ectopic atrial rhythm with HR of 41 bpm (PR interval 120 milliseconds, QRS 80 milliseconds, QTc 397 milliseconds) with overnight telemetry showing sinus arrest and intermittent junctional rhythm. Her baseline ECG demonstrating sinus rhythm is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nFig. 1\nPatient\u2019s initial rhythm on presentation to the hospital\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nPatient\u2019s baseline electrocardiogram\nFull size image\n\nPast medical history\nShe had a complex medical history including a qualitative platelet dysfunction disorder with multiple deep vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli on apixaban, granulosa cystic ovarian tumor, right nephrectomy for pyelonephritis, chronic pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hypertension. She worked in the pharmaceutical industry and did not consume tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Her medication list included albuterol inhaler, apixaban, cetirizine, cholecalciferol, clonazepam, cyanocobalamin spray, eszoplicone, fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, ivabradine, sertraline, potassium, and magnesium (Additional file 1).\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for a patient with bradycardia is wide. The first determination in a patient with bradycardia is whether it is the result of conduction abnormalities in the sinus node or the atrioventricular (AV) system. In the presented case, the normal PR interval and the absence of dropped beats suggested no AV conduction disease. Sinus bradycardia can be a manifestation of various intrinsic or extrinsic etiologies. Medications that can exacerbate sinus bradycardia include antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and psychoactive drugs.\n\nInvestigations\nGiven the acute presentation, an acquired cause was suspected. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (3.51 \u03bcIU/mL), AM cortisol (13.3 \u03bcg/dL), serum creatinine (1.2 mg/dL), potassium (4.0 mmol/L), and magnesium (1.9 mg/dL) were normal. A recent echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction and no major structural abnormalities. There were no signs of ischemia or heart failure (troponin T < 0.01 ng/mL, N-terminal pro BNP 64 pg/mL) and no evidence of situational syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. After ruling out common intrinsic and extrinsic causes, a potential cause of her bradycardia was identified. Considering drug interactions, we found no agents on her medication list that exacerbate the effects of ivabradine.\n\nManagement\nGiven her symptoms, ivabradine was withheld and she was discharged from the hospital after 2 days of observation in stable condition with discontinuation of ivabradine. Her heart rate upon ambulation was 70 bpm on discharge. Serum specimens were sent to the Toxicology Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for analysis as measurement of ivabradine levels could not be performed at our institution. Ivabradine concentrations at admission, 12 hours and 36 hours post-admission were 42 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 13 ng/mL, respectively. Ivabradine is expected to follow near-linear elimination with a half-life of 6 hours per the manufacturer, while clinical measurements estimate it at 11 hours. With chronic administration at 5 mg twice daily, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) expected is approximately 22 ng/mL 1 hour after oral administration and the mean steady-state plasma concentration is 10 ng/mL . Given the time of the last dose, the serum ivabradine levels should have been undetectable, but instead were twice the expected Cmax.",

    "original_case": "A 40 kg 9-year-old non-Indigenous Australian female was scheduled for an elective removal of a large right anterior deltoid keloid scar. Her medical history was significant for mild asthma. She had no known allergies, no past surgical or anesthetic history, and no significant family medical history, including no previous general anesthetics in either parent. Medications included regular inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol, with intermittent inhaled salbutamol as required for breakthrough asthma symptoms. She was normally a well and very active child. In the days leading up to her scheduled procedure, she had an intermittent dry cough with no exercise limitation, dyspnea, or fevers. Her preoperative physical examination demonstrated a mild intermittent wheeze in the right anterior basal lung field that resolved with salbutamol administration. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The decision to proceed with general anesthesia was based on a thorough assessment, consideration of all factors, and shared decision making with the family. Two factors leading to a general, rather than regional, anesthesia technique were the size of the lesion (with possibility of local anesthetic toxicity) and a previous traumatic experience when she had direct infiltration of intralesional corticosteroid previously. The patient received no other premedication and was cooperative with preoxygenation prior to an intravenous induction. She received 50 mg of intravenous propofol and 50 \u03bcg of intravenous fentanyl for induction, and was effectively manually ventilated with a circle system during the apneic period. A first-generation laryngeal mask airway (LMA) device was inserted without difficulty with an initial pressure control mode of ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, oxygen, and air (FiO2 0.50), with continuous monitoring of end-tidal capnography, oxygen saturation, heart, and noninvasive blood pressure. The surgical procedure took 30 minutes in the supine position and was uncomplicated. During the maintenance phase of anesthesia, there were no periods of hemodynamic instability, hypoxia, hypercarbia, muscle rigidity, impaired ventilation, or hyperthermia. There were also no obvious abnormalities seen on continuous cardiac telemetry. On emergence from anesthesia, 100 mg of intravenous propofol was given following cessation of sevoflurane to facilitate removal of her LMA under deep anesthesia. The patient subsequently became very difficult to ventilate with high airway pressures, hypoxia, and poor air movement with reduced chest expansion. As an emergency maneuver, her anesthesia was deepened with a further 100 mg of propofol and ongoing manual ventilation attempted with sevoflurane 8% on high flows of 100% oxygen. As this did not improve her ventilation or oxygenation, 50 mg of intravenous suxamethonium was administered with a rapid improvement in ventilation, oxygenation, and airway pressures. Given the rapidity of the situation, the differentials included laryngospasm or bronchospasm with interventions treating both possibilities. Upon recovery of oxygen saturation, chest auscultation demonstrated widespread wheeze initially, treated with in-line salbutamol, which was titrated to effect. She received approximately 1500 \u03bcg of inhaled salbutamol over a 15-minute period. She was supported with positive pressure mask ventilation until safe emergence from anesthesia, then transferred to the pediatric postoperative care unit. Forty-five minutes later in the recovery bay, once completely awake, the patient described right neck pain and lower back pain that prompted a medical review by the anesthetic team. She had a benign cervical spine and musculoskeletal examination, with no red flags. At this stage, reassurance was provided. Two hours later, in the discharge lounge, nursing staff noted an abnormal gait of the patient as she attempted to mobilize to the toilet. On further questioning, the patient was unable to walk unaided and needed full support to stand. A repeat medical review was requested, whereby she was found to have profound proximal lower limb muscle weakness, left lateral thigh pain, and right medial leg pain. She had reduced knee reflexes bilaterally and a broad-based unsteady gait. Her sensory function, upper limb examination, and cranial nerve examination were completely unremarkable. To exclude salbutamol-induced hypokalemia as a possible cause of acute weakness, a venous blood gas was ordered, revealing a mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mmol/L. Having excluded this as a cause, the working diagnosis was suxamethonium-induced myalgia. She was kept for prolonged observation for 3 hours, until her symptoms improved. On discharge, she was able to mobilize unaided. She was provided with strict return precautions if her symptoms deteriorated. The following day, her proximal muscle weakness had returned to involve all four limbs with associated tenderness. She was brought into the emergency department, needing assistance to mobilize. Urgent blood tests revealed a creatinine kinase (CK) of 22,679 units/L, suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Her renal function, electrolytes, and urinalysis were normal. She was admitted for observation with conservative management and resolution of her CK levels over a 4-day period. She had a gradual return to full muscle strength and function over a period of 4 weeks. An anesthetic alert letter was created, addressed to anesthetic, pediatric, and primary care teams to manage this patient until evidence suggested otherwise as sole rhabdomyolysis may reflect a spectrum of this disorder. Given the age of the patient, a muscle biopsy (gold standard test) to definitely identify susceptibility was not performed. Genetic tests were used as an alternative, and detected the following: Gene: RYR1 Genomic location (hg19): chr19:38979901G>A Variant: c.5632G>A Zygosity: heterozygous Classification: 3c\u2014a genetic variant of uncertain significance (VUS) with low clinical relevance.

Two hours later, the nursing staff noted an abnormal gait as she attempted to mobilize to the toilet. On further questioning, the patient was unable to walk unaided and needed full support to stand. A repeat medical review found her to have profound proximal lower limb muscle weakness, left lateral thigh pain, and right medial leg pain. Her knee reflexes were reduced bilaterally and her gait was broad-based and unsteady, while her sensory function, upper limb examination, and cranial nerve examination were completely unremarkable.\n\nWhile salbutamol-induced hypokalemia was initially suspected due to acute weakness, a venous blood gas test revealed only mild hypokalemia of 3.3",

In January 2018, he received 70 Gy (35 fractions) chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin for laryngeal cancer. In June 2018, the patient underwent total gastrectomy and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) for gastric cancer. In October 2018, total laryngectomy was performed for laryngeal cancer recurrence. There was no postoperative wound issue, oral ingestion was started 1 week after the operation, and the wound progressed uneventfully. Subsequently, gastric cancer recurred in November 2018, and combination therapy with ramucirumab and paclitaxel was initiated. In January 2019 (3 months after the previous surgery), the total laryngectomy skin incision suddenly started to leak saliva without any warning signs, such as redness, abscess formation, or skin ulceration . Although ramucirumab was discontinued because the adverse event was thought to be caused by the drug, the issue continued to increase in size . It was managed with various conservative treatments, for example, antibiotics, discontinuation of oral intake, enteral feeding, and negative pressure wound therapy. In February 2019 (1 month after the development of the issue), it was closed using pectoral major musculocutaneous flap reconstructive surgery. However, shortly after the operation, a new issue appeared at a site different from the previous one. The new issue was again treated with the same conservative approach. This conservative treatment was performed for approximately 7 months repeatedly for new occurrences, and a second pectoral major musculocutaneous flap reconstructive surgery was performed in August 2019 (7 months after the development of the first issue). There was no subsequent relapse, but it took 8 months from the appearance of the first issue to complete closure . For 8 months, he was unable to orally ingest much of anything, nor could he receive chemotherapy for stomach cancer. In this patient, ramucirumab was administered for 2 months before the first surgery for recurrence of gastric cancer, and an issue developed 3 months after the total laryngectomy. The issue was intractable, and complete closure was achieved after 8 months. Anemia, hypoalbuminemia, underweight, and hypothyroidism were detected in the laboratory data ().

At 20 weeks of gestation, fetal growth restriction was detected, and at 24 weeks suspicious findings of a left-sided CDH and atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) were observed in the fetus. The observed lung-to-head ratio was approximately 30%. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging revealed intestinal penetration of the thoracic cavity (Fig. 1 A, B, arrows), but liver herniation was not detected. Thus, the severity of CDH was estimated as moderate, with a survival rate of 50\u201360%.

In our hospital, all patients were undergoing emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after transfer to the catheterization laboratory. After catheterization, pharmacological treatment was prescribed according to guidelines.\n\nHere we introduce one of the patients, a 52-year-old male was referred to the emergency department of Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, due to chest pain for 2 hours before admission. He had no documented comorbidity. He was a current smoker with a 25-year-history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day. He was fully conscious and had a regular heart rhythm (100 beats/minute) with normal heart sounds. No cardiac murmurs were heard on auscultation. The results of the lung and abdomen examinations were unremarkable. Five minutes after his admission, an emergency ECG  showed sinus rhythm and up-sloping ST-segment depression in leads V2\u2013V6. Laboratory data showed elevated creatinine kinase (CK)-MB and troponin I. Treatment with Plavix (600 mg) and chewable aspirin (300 mg) was performed immediately. Before transferring the patient to the catheterization laboratory, he had two episodes of ventricular fibrillation terminated by direct-current (DC) shock. He underwent emergent catheterization within 15 minutes of admission. Angiographic data revealed significant (99%) mid-part stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), significant (95%) ostial stenosis of the second diagonal branch (bifurcation lesion), and significant distal stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA). Primary PCI on bifurcation stenosis was performed .\n\nFig. 1 Electrocardiography of patient at time of admission Full size image  \nFig. 2 Post-percutaneous coronary intervention electrocardiography Full size image",

The average age of these patients was around 51.91 \u00b1 16.35 years, ranging from 30 to 82 years. The group included five women and six men. Their individual characteristics varied greatly. \n\nThe medical conditions of these patients revealed right coronary artery involvement in four instances, left circumflex artery in three, proximal left anterior descending artery also in three cases, and the middle left anterior descending artery in seven cases. These findings were based on angiographic studies. \n\nThe age range of our case series was quite broad. One notable case was a 30-year-old female diabetic patient with proximal LAD involvement but no prior familial history of such condition. There were also two 34-year-old patients, one of whom presented with no known cardiovascular risk factors. All patients in our study underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) upon arrival at our catheterization laboratory. The subsequent pharmacological treatment was guided by standard protocols.\n\nIn this series, we highlight a patient who is a 52-year-old male. He was admitted to the Imam Reza Hospital's emergency department because of chest pain. The duration of his chest pain before seeking medical attention is not precise. He did not have any documented comorbidities but had a long-term smoking habit of 20 cigarettes daily for an unspecified number of years. His initial examination showed him to be fully conscious, with a regular heart rhythm of 100 beats per minute. He had no strange heart sounds, and the results of lung and abdomen examinations showed no abnormalities. Shortly after his arrival, an emergency ECG showed sinus rhythm and up-sloping ST-segment depression in leads V2\u2013V6. Laboratory tests revealed elevated creatinine kinase (CK)-MB and troponin I. He was promptly treated with Plavix (600 mg) and chewable aspirin (300 mg). The patient experienced ventricular fibrillation on multiple occasions, which was managed with direct-current (DC) shocks. It was following these episodes that an emergency catheterization was performed.

    "original_case": "During a summer rainstorm, a 50-year-old Caucasian man riding a bicycle in the forested area around the city of Trieste, Italy, was struck by lightning, resulting in immediate CA, as reported by bystanders. Basic life support was not initiated by the lay bystanders, but was initiated only a few minutes later by a physician hiking nearby and subsequently continued by the medical emergency system personnel who arrived at the scene 15 min after the event. The presenting rhythm was asystole, with a downtime before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of 16 minutes. After ROSC, the patient remained unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3, non-reactive mydriatic pupils, and stable blood pressure and oxygenation values once intubated. During the secondary examination at hospital admission, a cutaneous lesion in the occipital area was noted, described as singed hair with a dominant burning smell, linear in shape, with a small round black eschar, presumably compatible with the first contact with lightning .\n\nThe presence of burnt plastic at the level of the occipital slot of the helmet was consistent with the hypothesis of the eschar being the first contact with lightning. Similar erythematous cutaneous lesions with singed hair were found at the suprapubic level, probably the output area in proximity to the metal core of the bicycle frame through the saddle .\n\nIn addition, the right tympanic membrane was perforated. Ophthalmological assessment was negative. Total body computed tomography (CT) scan showed a modest right apical and temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage, millimeter-sized petechial hemorrhages in the cortical-subcortical junction of the fronto-parietal lobes, and slight signs of initial edema . An abundant hemoperitoneum associated with a bleeding hepatic angioma was present.\n\nThe patient underwent immediate damage control surgery, with abdominal packaging to control the bleeding, and then was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory tests on blood samples revealed elevated biomarkers of myocardial and hepatic injury (high-sensitivity troponin I, 90,879 ng/L; creatine kinase, 1131 U/L; aspartate and alanine transaminases, 361 and 421 U/L, respectively; blood lactate, 11.36 mmol/L). The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with minimal nonspecific ST elevation in the inferior leads, and cardiac ultrasonography showed normokinetic ventricles; no further cardiology investigations were undertaken at that time. Owing to the prolonged time to admission, target controlled temperature management was not established, and the subsequent appearance of fever (from day 2 after ICU admission, mean central body temperature of 38.2 \u00b0C with only one peak at 38.8 \u00b0C) was managed with ice packs, a short period of diclofenac infusion, and then acetaminophen on demand. No prophylactic therapy against vasospasm or brain edema was initiated since serum hyperosmolality was persistently elevated (319 mOsm/L). Following surgery, the patient remained in cardiogenic shock with profound hemodynamic instability and lactic metabolic acidosis. Increasingly higher norepinephrine doses were needed to support arterial pressure, peaking 0.95 mcg/kg/min on day 2. On day 3, after adequate goal-direct volume expansion, terlipressin infusion was added to the treatment regimen (peaking at 1.28 mcg/kg/h). Cardiac function was restored to normal, as demonstrated by a further ultrasound assessment. Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis (noted at admission to the ICU by the elevated levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatine kinase [1131 U]) and oliguria were managed with volume expansion with crystalloids, urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate boluses, and diuretics. A brain CT scan was repeated on day 2, revealing a further reduction of the cortico-subcortical differentiation bilaterally in the frontal-parietal and temporo-occipital areas compatible with anoxic edema, a marked flattening of the cortical convolutions, and the obliteration of the supratentorial peri-encephalic liquor spaces, also at the level of basal cisterns. On day 3, sedation was interrupted to allow for neuroprognostication. A neurological clinical assessment revealed a persisting GCS of 3 and the absence of pupillary and corneal reflexes. Somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated bilateral absence of the cortical somatosensory N20-potential (ERB- and N13-potential were present) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded minimal cerebral electrical activity with very low voltages. On day 4, hemodynamic stability was obtained, allowing for tapering of vasopressor support, and the fever ceased. On day 5, the patient remained unconscious with a GCS of 3 and only a weak cough reflex and respiratory drive. A new EEG revealed an isoelectric trace. A cerebral CT angiography revealed a regular opacification of the arterial circulation with normal venous drainage. Direct scanning highlighted further reduced cortical-subcortical differentiation and marked flattening of brain convolution .\n\nThe patient died on day 10. A post-mortem evaluation revealed signs of multi-organ hypoperfusion, with effects on subendocardial and transmural cardiomyocytes. Cerebral sections confirmed the CT findings of petechiae and subarachnoid hemorrhage previously located along the electrical current and as a result of direct damage to brain vasculature. Brain tissue softening and edema were associated with the direct effects of electrical passage. The cerebral parenchyma sections revealed an abundant, non-selective loss of neurons . We collected detailed medical information from the patient\u2019s relatives, but nothing in his medical history could be related to any previous neurological or cognitive disturbances.",

Suddenly, he was struck by a bolt of lightning, leading to immediate cardiac arrest (CA) as confirmed by nearby observers. The onlookers, although not medically trained, did not initiate basic life support, but a doctor hiking in the area did so a few minutes later. The medical emergency team arrived on the scene 15 minutes after the incident and continued the life support. The man's presenting rhythm was asystole, with no spontaneous circulation returning until 16 minutes after his CA.\n\nFollowing the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the patient remained unconscious. His Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 3, he had non-reactive mydriatic pupils, and stable blood pressure and oxygenation levels once intubated. Upon secondary examination at the hospital, a burn wound was seen at the occipital area, characterized by singed hair and a dominant burnt smell. It was linear, with a small round black eschar, presumably the initial contact point of the lightning strike.\n\nThe burn marks continued to the suprapubic area, possibly the exit point, close to the metal core of the bicycle frame. Furthermore, the man's right eardrum was ruptured. The total body CT scan revealed a minor right apical and temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage, tiny petechial hemorrhages in the cortical-subcortical junction of the fronto-parietal lobes, and early signs of edema. Additionally, there was a large amount of blood in the peritoneal cavity due to a bleeding hepatic angioma.\n\nImmediate damage control surgery was performed, with abdominal packing to stop the bleeding. Following surgery, the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Blood tests revealed high levels of myocardial and hepatic injury biomarkers. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia with a slight nonspecific ST elevation in the inferior leads. Cardiac ultrasonography showed normal ventricle kinetics. No further cardiology investigations were performed at this time. The patient remained in a state of shock with severe hemodynamic instability and lactic metabolic acidosis. Increasingly higher doses of norepinephrine were needed to support arterial pressure, peaking at 0.95 mcg/kg/min on day 2. On day 3, after adequate goal-directed volume expansion, terlipressin infusion was added to the treatment regimen.\n\nDespite the patient's critical condition, a brain CT scan repeated on day 2 revealed a further reduction in cortico-subcortical differentiation bilaterally in the frontal-parietal and temporo-occipital areas, which might be indicative of anoxic edema. A marked flattening of the cortical convolutions, and obliteration of the supratentorial peri-encephalic liquor spaces were also observed, further hinting at the possibility of shock due to the lightning strike.\n\nThe patient passed away on day 10.

Symptoms were preceded by 1 day of headache and fever, prompting evaluation at an urgent care center where she was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. On the morning of presentation, she sought further evaluation in the emergency department for symptom progression to chest pain, heavy breathing, and confusion. Pertinent examination findings at presentation included disorientation, combative behavior without focal neurologic deficit, tachycardia, Kussmaul breathing, dry mucus membranes, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 22.3 \u00d7 10\u00b3/mcL), anion-gap metabolic acidosis (pH 6.92, pCO\u2082 < 5 torr, base deficit 28), and hyperglycemia (glucose 668 mg/dL). Urinalysis was significant for ketonuria and glucosuria. Physical examination and laboratory findings were consistent with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C > 16%) complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), likely triggered by acute COVID-19 infection, with features concerning for cerebral edema. She was started on continuous insulin infusion (0.1 units/kg/h), given a bolus of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS), and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further management. DKA was treated according to the institutional protocol with intravenous fluids, continuous insulin infusion, and close electrolyte monitoring.\n\nDue to persistent alteration in mental status shortly after admission, she received two additional HTS boluses and had head computed tomography (CT) scan, which was normal. Despite these interventions and resolution of metabolic derangements, her mentation remained altered. On day 2 of admission, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward. Additional findings were notable for dehiscence of the planum sphenoidale and involvement of the left nasal cavity near superior turbinate, which was concerning for an infectious cerebritis with possible developing phlegmon/intracranial abscess. In the clinical setting of DKA, these findings were concerning for invasive sinusitis with intracranial extension. Lumbar puncture (LP) was subsequently performed on day 2 and revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and negative meningitis encephalitis panel. CSF cultures were not obtained at that time due to limited sample volume. An infectious diseases specialist was consulted and recommended an empiric antimicrobial regimen with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and liposomal amphotericin B given the risk for invasive fungal disease. The patient did not meet criteria for treatment of acute COVID-19 infection, so steroids and antivirals were deferred.\n\nFig. 1 Head images (CT and MRI). a (Day 2 admission): MRI T1 brain sagittal view showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward through the right gyrus rectus. b (Day 3 admission): sinus CT showed mild opacification of superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive changes of the osseous septa and possible defect. c (Day 4 admission): head CT showed cerebral edema with mass effect suggestive of infectious cerebritis. d (Day 10 admission): MRI Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain coronal view showed significantly increased area of cerebritis/phlegmon involving right frontal lobe extending into the basal ganglia. Interval increased midline shift with extension of vasogenic edema to the left gyrus rectus. e (Day 16 admission): MRI T2 brain horizontal view showed progression of parenchymal involvement involving right frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, and across the corpus callosum to the contralateral side with a 3-mm right-to-left midline shift. f (Day 25 admission, day 15 post ope, 9/29 images): increased mass effect with right-to-left midline shift with interval increased hypodensity involving the right frontotemporal lobes, basal ganglia, and thalamus extending to the right midbrain, representing increased edema or infection.\n\nOn day 3 of admission, sinus CT scan  revealed mild opacification of the superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive change of the osseous septa and possible bone defect. An otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgeon performed an endoscopic nasal examination, notable for friable tissue without evidence of necrosis. Due to limited patient tolerance during the awake examination, biopsies were not obtained at that time. On day 4 of admission, repeat head CT  showed interval progression of intracranial pathology with mass effect and cerebral edema suggestive of infectious cerebritis. Repeat LP was unsuccessful, so blood metagenomics testing (Karius test, Redwood City, CA) was obtained on day 5 to aid in the diagnosis. She continued to have daily fevers despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Blood cultures obtained at initial presentation remained negative, and an evaluation for endocarditis as a potential source of fever was unrevealing. Invasive fungal disease was most concerning among the differential diagnoses, so posaconazole was added to the antimicrobial regimen on day 7 of admission while awaiting results of the Karius test. Results returned on day 9 of admission and revealed genetic material belonging to a fungal organism. The positive Karius test in the setting of progressive intracranial disease confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nVancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole were discontinued, and treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole was continued at that time. Repeat imaging on day 10  showed disease progression with worsening midline shift while on maximal antifungal therapy, prompting the decision to pursue emergent surgical debridement. The patient underwent frontal craniotomy with drainage of abscess and sphenoidotomy with debridement. Intraoperative findings were notable for invasive infection and necrotizing cerebritis . Pathology revealed necrosis with non-septate broad hyphae and scattered giant cells with micro-abscess formation. Posaconazole was discontinued on day 13 due to prolonged QTc interval identified on surveillance electrocardiogram (EKG) and was replaced with isavuconazole. Nasal amphotericin irrigations were performed by ENT as adjunctive therapy.\n\nFig. 2 Endoscopic view of the right nasal cavity. Avascular fibrinous conversion of the superior turbinate (St) extends to the level of the anterior skull base (Sb) without classic black necrotic eschar typically visualized with invasive fungal sinusitis.

Microscopic examination of the debridement specimen from right frontal lobe reveals necrotic brain tissue with broad-based ribbon-like pauciseptate hyphae. The angle of branching is wide-angle and greater than other organisms, usually approaching 90\u00b0 (a and b). Angioinvasion is easily identified (c). There is a marked inflammatory response which is neutrophilic and granulomatous between the viable brain tissue and necrosis (d). a (Periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain) and b (Grocott\u2013Gomori methenamine silver stain): Irregular, broad-based, pauciseptate thick fungal hyphae branching at right angles in the necrotic focus (original magnification, \u00d7400). c Angioinvasion or invasion of the vessels by hyphae. d (Hematoxylin\u2013eosin stain): Granulomatous inflammatory response (original magnification, \u00d7400).\n\nThe patient suffered from central diabetes insipidus and neurological deficits including left-sided hemiparesis and persistent fluctuations in mental status. Weekly head imaging was performed for disease surveillance and showed progression of disease despite maximal antifungal therapy. On postoperative day 6 (day 16 of admission), brain MRI  showed extension of intracranial infection to the contralateral hemisphere and brainstem involvement. Given these findings, no further neurosurgical intervention was recommended. Progression of the disease continued, and subsequent imaging  showed worsening midline shift (1.5 cm on postoperative day 15) with evidence of early temporal lobe herniation. Hospital course was additionally complicated by nephrotoxicity, aspiration pneumonia, and venous catheter-associated thrombus formation requiring anticoagulation therapy. Nasal amphotericin irrigations were discontinued on hospital day 20 due to severe nosebleeds during the procedure.\n\nSupportive care was offered for the aforementioned complications, and the patient continued maintenance therapy with liposomal amphotericin B and isavuconazole. Dose adjustments were made to the antifungals due to renal impairment. Despite these challenges, her clinical status steadily improved. She was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility on hospital day 79 for ongoing medical management and intensive therapies to maximize functional status. After 104 days total of inpatient management, the patient was discharged home and transitioned to outpatient care. Amphotericin B was discontinued at time of discharge, and she remains on isavuconazole monotherapy. As of 10 months from initial diagnosis, she continues showing improvement in functional domains as she can fully ambulate and perform activities of daily living with minimal assistance.",
    "rewritten_case": "A previously healthy 13-year-old African American female (body mass index 19.2 kg/m\u00b2, 55.99% for age and sex percentile) arrived at the emergency department with a primary complaint of mental confusion and difficulty breathing. The symptoms were preceded by a day of fever and headache which led to an examination at an urgent care center where she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. On the morning of presentation, she sought further evaluation in the emergency department for worsening symptoms, including chest pain, heavy breathing, and confusion. \n\nPertinent examination findings included confusion, aggressive behavior without focal neurologic deficit, tachycardia, Kussmaul breathing, dry mucus membranes, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 22.3 \u00d7 10\u00b3/mcL), anion-gap metabolic acidosis (pH 6.92, pCO\u2082 < 5 torr, base deficit 28), and hyperglycemia (glucose 668 mg/dL). Urinalysis was significant for ketonuria and glucosuria. Physical examination and laboratory findings were indicative of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C > 16%) complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), likely triggered by acute COVID-19 infection, with features concerning for cerebral edema. Continuous insulin infusion (0.1 units/kg/h) was initiated, a bolus of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) was administered, and the patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further management. \n\nOn day 2 of admission, a brain MRI scan revealed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward. Additional findings were notable for dehiscence of the planum sphenoidale and involvement of the left nasal cavity near superior turbinate, which was concerning for an infectious cerebritis with possible developing phlegmon/intracranial abscess. Notably, the patient had also developed a rapidly progressive skin lesion on her arm, which appeared necrotic and was surrounded by an erythematous halo. This lesion, along with her clinical picture, raised suspicion for cutaneous mucormycosis, a rare but aggressive fungal infection. \n\nAn infectious diseases specialist was consulted and recommended an empiric antimicrobial regimen with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and liposomal amphotericin B given the risk for invasive fungal disease. On day 3 of admission, a biopsy of the skin lesion was performed, revealing broad, non-septate hyphae, consistent with mucormycosis. Despite the biopsy results, the patient's mental status did not improve, and on day 5, a repeat brain MRI showed worsening cerebral edema and progression of the intracranial abscess. \n\nDue to the continued mental status changes, the patient underwent a lumbar puncture which revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and negative meningitis encephalitis panel. Blood cultures remained negative, and an evaluation for endocarditis as a potential source of fever was unrevealing. Despite the skin biopsy findings and the progression of the intracranial abscess, the patient's clinical picture remained consistent with invasive cutaneous mucormycosis. \n\nThe patient continued to suffer from neurological deficits, including left-sided hemiparesis and persistent changes in mental status. Despite maximal antifungal therapy, further imaging showed progression of disease. Given these findings, no further neurosurgical intervention was recommended. The patient was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility for ongoing medical management and intensive therapies to maximize functional status. After 104 days total of inpatient management, the patient was discharged home and transitioned to outpatient care. As of 10 months from initial diagnosis, she continues showing improvement",

Four patients, all Asian female, aged between 26 and 71 years old, with average age of 49.25 \u00b1 18.38 were included in this study. To protect the privacy of the patients, we hid their real names, visiting department, hospitalization number, bed number, and other related information. Cases 1 and 2 were previously healthy, while cases 3 and 4 were accompanied by hypertension and renal insufficiency. There was no obvious abnormality in their family or psychosocial history, including related genetic information. Investigations on admission showed no history of pancreatic/salivary gland-related diseases or trauma, neoplasms, genital tract diseases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) operation history, or abdominal surgery. In addition, patients were not diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, common drug factors (such as amino salicylic acid, thiopurine, and asparaginase), or megaamylasemia that can cause elevated serum amylase levels. Basic information and clinical data of the four patients are presented in .  \n Clinical data  \nFull size table  \nClinical manifestations  \nCase 1 showed persistent upper abdominal pain and right abdominal tenderness, with no episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or rebound pain following high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL. Case 2 had abdominal distension, persistent epigastric pain, with no other concomitant symptoms, either. Meanwhile, cases 3 and 4 did not show any significant symptoms. The positive physical examination results of the four cases were all related to the primary disease, and the abdominal physical examination showed no apparent abnormality.  \nClinical findings  \nAfter high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL, serum amylase (AMY) levels increased in four patients, peaking at 193.1 to 340.4 U/L. In addition, increases in urine amylase and serum lipase were also observed. Abdominal enhanced CT scan performed after the occurrence of elevated serum amylase levels in case 1 showed sand-like stones in the gallbladder, with a normal shape of pancreas. In cases 2, 3, and 4, abdominal ultrasound performed prior to high-dose mPSL indicated gallbladder sediment-like stones, rough gallbladder wall, and gallbladder stones, respectively. Notably, the CT scans in cases 2, 3, and 4 did not reveal any abnormalities of the pancreas. The AMY fluctuations of the four patients over time are shown in Fig. 1.  \nFig. 1  \nAMY fluctuations of the four cases and the corresponding course of disease. The four cases started to use high-dose mPSL on the 3rd day, 6th day, 8th day, and 9th day of the disease course. AMY elevation was noted on the 19th day, 9th day, 14th day, and 13th day, respectively. AMY peak appeared on day 22, day 17, day 18, and day 34, respectively. Amylase was monitored for five consecutive days in cases 1 and 2 and weekly in cases 3 and 4.  \nFull size image  \nDiagnostic assessment and diagnosis  \nThe above clinical manifestations, physical examinations, and clinical data were to be not very specific for diagnosis. Only cases 1 and 2 experienced epigastric pain, while enhancement CT in case 1 revealed gallstones. We were able to identify elevated serum amylase levels on the basis of the fact that the four patients had different elevations of AMY that exceeded the normal reference values of our hospital system. We speculate about the possibility of elevated serum amylase levels caused by high doses of intravenous GC through the adverse drug response evaluation described below. We considered whether this can be attributed to drug-induced pancreatitis, but imaging did not reveal any pancreatic abnormalities and therefore diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis were not met. The overall prognosis of the four patients is good.  \nInterventions and outcomes  \nCase 1 and 2 underwent fasting. Then, they were given omeprazole to inhibit gastric acid, phloroglucinol as antispasmodic, somatostatin to inhibit pancreatic enzyme secretion, and anti-infection and nutritional support treatment. Two patients were discharged after a significant decrease in AMY levels, and case 3 and 4 were discharged after improvement of the primary disease. At outpatient review, they indicated that mPLS was effective for the primary disease and that, despite the unexpected increase in AMY, subsequent active interventions led to normalization of AMY. Unfortunately, they have not been followed since then.",

Both her parents had died from lung cancer, and there was no further family history of gastrointestinal or pancreatic cancer. She was the mother of three children and used the following medications: allopurinol, metoprolol, omeprazole, perindopril/indapamide, and pravastatin. \n\nPhysical examination revealed three cutaneous nodules ranging in diameter from 1 to 4 cm on both legs . One was slightly red, while the other two were dark red to purple\u2013blue. All were painful during palpation. According to the dermatologist, the skin lesions were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of panniculitis. Further neurological and physical examination was not performed. \n\nFig. 1 Cutaneous nodules on both legs during presentation Full size image \n\nThe skin biopsy obtained showed a predominantly lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis of which the aspect was highly suspicious for pancreatic panniculitis . Based on this finding, further diagnostic analyses were performed including blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scan followed by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and fine-needle biopsy. A lipase serum level of >\u20093000 U/L (normal range <\u200960 U/L) and a mass located between the stomach and the left side of the pancreas, with a diameter of 7.4 cm, was seen .

She was noted to be tachypneic and hypoxemic, with 93% oxygen saturation on nasal cannula (5 L/minute) upon initial presentation. On examination she had dental caries and dry oral mucosal membranes. Moreover, there were diffuse ronchi and decreased breath sounds in her lower lobes bilaterally. Skin ulcers were noted on the shin of her lower extremity. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed large bilateral pleural effusions, severe bronchiectasis bilaterally with septal thickening, dilated medium-sized airways with eccentric pulmonary arteries, and thin walled cysts .

A decade ago, she was diagnosed with pSS, confirmed by lip biopsy and positive antibody markers. Her symptoms, including eye and mouth dryness, were managed conservatively using artificial saliva, frequent water intake, sugarless lemon drops, cyclosporine eye drops, and biodyne mouthwash and toothpaste. Her medical history revealed hypothyroidism (treated with levothyroxine 100 mcg), iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, bronchiectasis, complete heart block requiring a pacemaker, and a distant history of breast cancer treated with tamoxifen and bilateral mastectomy over 20 years ago. \n\nUpon admission, she was found to be tachypneic and hypoxemic, with an oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula (5 L/minute). An examination revealed dental caries and dry oral mucosal membranes. Furthermore, diffuse ronchi and decreased breath sounds were noted in her lower lobes bilaterally. Skin ulcers were also observed on her lower extremity shin. \n\nHigh-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed large bilateral pleural effusions, severe bronchiectasis bilaterally with septal thickening, dilated medium-sized airways with eccentric pulmonary arteries, and thin-walled cysts. Pleural fluid analysis results were consistent with an exudate and were negative for signs of malignancy or infection. A pleural biopsy showed benign mesothelial cells and histiocytes, but no malignant cells. \n\nEchocardiography revealed elevated right heart pressures (PASP of 39 mmHg), normal ejection fraction, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and mild diastolic dysfunction. Laboratory tests indicated pancytopenia, and the results of the iron panel were within acceptable ranges, albeit at the lower end. \n\nA rheumatology-targeted workup revealed positive anti-Ro (SSA) antibody (> 8) (reference level: < 1), RF, elevated beta-2-microglobulin, cryoglobulinemia (level not quantitated), hypocomplementia, elevated inflammatory markers, negative ANA, and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. \n\nNotably, an increase in abnormal B-cells was detected in the blood. This is a marker for certain types of lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Her hypoxemia was likely multi-factorial, attributable to the large pleural effusions and parenchymal lung disease. \n\nConsidering her clinical history, lab results, and the presence of abnormal B-cells, a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was considered. This could explain her pleural effusions, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary hypertension, as lymphomas can cause inflammation and tissue injury in the pulmonary system.

Echocardiography findings were highly suggestive for precapillary pulmonary hypertension: severe right chambers dilation, D-shaped left ventricle, severe tricuspid regurgitation, high velocity of tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary pressure estimated at 100 mmHg, dilated and not collapsing inferior vena cava, and pericardial effusion. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest excluded pulmonary embolism; high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) ruled out parenchymal diseases and mediastinal lymphadenopathy; capillaroscopy documented a scleroderma pattern; antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-centromere antibodies (ACA), and anti-mitochondrial antibodies tested positive; HIV serology tested negative; hepatic echo-Doppler ruled out portopulmonary hypertension. Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was not tested because of severe hypoxemia. Right heart catheterization (RCAT) documented a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 58 mmHg, cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m\u00b2, right atrial pressure (RAP) of 8 mmHg, pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) of 8 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 16 Woods units (WU). Laboratory tests showed a monoclonal spike of IgG-\u03bb. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (34 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (34 U/L) and bilirubin levels (1 mg/dL) tested within normal ranges. N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) tested positive for possible heart failure (4534 ng/L). Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was ruled out as a cause of PAH by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Continuous intravenous treatment with epoprostenol was proposed but refused by the patient, who was therefore treated with a high dose of furosemide before starting a specific oral therapy for PAH. At first, suspecting PVOD, sildenafil 20 mg BID was prescribed and titrated to 20 mg TID over 1 month, without reported adverse effects. After this, macitentan was prescribed at 10 mg OD. After 1 month, a significant increase in AST (485 U/L) and ALT (451 U/L) levels was found on routine analyses. Macitentan therapy was therefore suspended, with a gradual decrease in levels of transaminases. Liver ultrasound and complete viral serology showed no signs of specific diseases. After suspending macitentan administration, the patient\u2019s clinical condition worsened and sildenafil was replaced with tadalafil 20 mg OD, which was then titrated to 40 mg OD. In February 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases, selexipag therapy was introduced with slow titration. After 2 months, at the dose of 800 mcg BID with selexipag, AST and ALT levels were increased (201 and 232 U/L). Selexipag therapy was suspended, and RCAT was performed, resulting in the following: mean PAP of 62 mmHg, CI of 2.6 L/min/m\u00b2, RAP of 6 mmHg, and PVR of 12.7 WU. The implant of a subcutaneous pump for treprostinil infusion was proposed but refused by the patient. In May 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases and after a pharmacogenetics consultation, ambrisentan was prescribed (5 mg/die) in association with tadalafil (40 mg/die). After the last RCAT (PAP 42 mmHg, CI 3.5 l/min/m\u00b2, RAP 6 mmHg, PVR 7.7 UW), the patient started triple therapy, adding inhaled iloprost.

Initially, the patient showed a good response to prokinetic drugs and changes in the diet, but gradually her condition deteriorated. She recorded a 20 kg weight loss. On arrival at our department, the patient was hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, she appeared cachectic and had a burn injury scar on her face. Her abdominal examination and cardiovascular examination were normal. On neurological examination, she was well oriented in time, place, person, and perception. She had decreased tone in bilateral lower limbs with a power of 2/5. She had absent reflexes with downgoing plantars in bilateral lower limbs.

Delivery was completed at the Gynecological center at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo, with a birth weight (BW) of 3600 g. Cholecalciferol (D3) for prevention of vitamin D deficiency was administered regularly. She was vaccinated regularly as per national vaccination calendar. She was breastfed for 1 year and a half, and supplementary food was introduced at 6 months of life. Her growth and development were normal. No relevant family history was reported. She was diagnosed with epilepsy 4 years ago. She initially presented with generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, and antiepileptic therapy, valproic acid, was initiated by pediatric neurologist. Despite treatment and compliance with therapy, seizures continued; therefore, a second antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, was introduced, and she continued to be on both antiepileptic drugs and comply with therapy. However, recently, she started to manifest hallucinations, emotional disturbances, and irritability, and the psychiatrist put her on fluoxetine. Later, she experienced cognitive decline, behavioral change, dysarthria, and difficulty walking. At admission, she weighed 40 kg and was disoriented, irritable, and unable to communicate. Physical examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed no erythema or swelling, but difficulty walking independently. Other system examination revealed no pathologic findings. Overall, the results of routine blood tests showed normal values; hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count was 156,000/mm3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein was negative. Furthermore, liver enzymes, urea, and creatinine, as well as acid\u2013base status of the blood, were within normal values. Other investigations, including urinalysis, were negative, too. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses excluded infectious and immune-mediated etiology. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed, and the psychiatrist was consulted. Owing to progressive neurological status deterioration and lack of response to therapy, it was decided to send the child to a more advanced center abroad for genetic testing because of the inability to perform genetic testing in the country. At the same time, axillary skin biopsy was performed and inclusion bodies were detected. The results of genetic testing also confirmed the diagnosis by detecting a mutation on the NHLRC1 gene. Therefore, parental testing to confirm their carrier status was recommended, as well as genetic counseling. By the time the diagnosis was confirmed, the child had almost lost the ability to walk and speak. She could walk with great difficulty with the help of both parents on each side (the rest of the time via wheelchair) and could articulate a few sentences with difficulty.

He had a history of penoscrotal hypospadias in childhood, which were repaired, and obstructive and irritating symptoms in adolescence. The patient complained of recurrent urethral tract infection UTI accompanied with purulent discharge from urethra and fever. He was also referred to other clinics several times over the years and underwent urethra dilatation owing to bulbar tract stenosis. In his last combined voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and retrograde urethrogram (RUG), stenosis was observed in the proximal bulbar urethra . On main urethral cystoscopy, the mucosa was relatively pale and the opening of the second urethra was not visible in the penile and bulbar urethra. Stricture and paleness of the mucosa was also seen in the proximal bulbar urethra. On flexible cystoscopy, the opening of the second urethra was visible at 12 o\u2019clock and a distance of 3 cm from the verumontanum in the bulbar urethra. The guidewire was first passed, and it was palpated along the penis at the dorsal level of the patient\u2019s main urethra to a distance of 5 cm from the tip of the penis. Fig. 1 Patient\u2019s RUG before operation, showing stenosis in the proximal region of the bulbar urethra Full size image The patient was taken to the operation room and underwent general anesthesia in lithotomy position. Then a longitudinal incision was made in the perineal area, and the urethra was dissected from one side. Owing to the stenosis and adhesions caused by previous surgeries, it was released from the dorsal surface and from the corpus cavernosum. The guidewire was then palpated from the dorsal side of the urethra, a plane was taken between the two urethras, and the urethral duplication was dissected from the main urethra. It was removed from the proximal opening of the urethra, and its orifice was repaired with 4\u20130 vicryl suture. The distal urethra in the dorsal region was completely closed, so it was dissected and the double urethra (secondary) was removed with operation. The patient was followed for 1 month after surgery . Foley 18 F and 16 F cystostomy catheters were inserted to ensure urinary flow and prevent restenosis. Finally, the skin and fascia were repaired with 4\u20130 vicryl suture.

His medical records indicated a past condition of penoscrotal hypospadias during his early years, which had been surgically corrected. He also reported bothersome and obstructive symptoms during his teenage years. The patient had been experiencing repeated bouts of urethral tract infections, characterized by a purulent discharge from the urethra and accompanied by fever. He had sought medical intervention at various clinics over an undefined period, necessitating urethra dilatation due to the presence of bulbar tract stenosis.\n\nIn one of the non-sequential combined voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and retrograde urethrogram (RUG) evaluations, stenosis was detected in the proximal bulbar urethra. A primary urethral cystoscopy revealed a relatively pale mucosa, with no visible opening of the second urethra in the penile and bulbar urethra. Stricture and an unusually pale mucosa were also observed in the proximal bulbar urethra. However, a flexible cystoscopy detected the opening of the second urethra at the 12 o\u2019clock position and at a distance of 3 cm from the verumontanum in the bulbar urethra. The guidewire was successfully passed and palpated along the penis at the dorsal level of the patient\u2019s primary urethra, extending to a distance of 5 cm from the tip of the penis.\n\nThe patient underwent a surgical procedure under general anesthesia, positioned lithotomically.

Her past medical history was unremarkable and she neither smoked nor drank alcohol, nor she did not take any medication except intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF in her left eye 2 years previously. At presentation, her vital signs were stable (pulse rate 80 beats/minute, blood pressure: 115/60 mmHg, temperature: 36.9 \u00b0C), and baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 3/10 in both eyes. Anterior segment examination using slit-lamp biomicroscopy was unremarkable, and intraocular pressure was within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed parafoveal telangiectatic vessels with capillary dilatation, as well as barely visible sclerotic vessels temporal to the macula, in both eyes. There was also dense circinate exudation and edema in the macula of the right eye. In the left eye, irregular perifoveal graying discoloration was evident . Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula in the right eye demonstrated aneurysms of various sizes located within inner retinal layers as well as exudation and retinal thickening. Retina in the macular area of the left eye was atrophic with disorganization of retina inner layers (DRIL). Of note, despite extensive capillary dropout, the architecture of the photoreceptors remained intact (Fig. 2a, c).\n\nFig. 1 Color fundus photographs of the right (a) and left (b) eye demonstrate parafoveal telangiectatic vessels and round red lesions representing microaneurysms as well as occluded sclerotic vessels (black arrows) in both eyes. Macular edema and circinate exudation are evident in the right eye (a) Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Macula OCT of the right eye (a) shows various-sized aneurysms within inner retinal layers, exudation, and retinal thickening in the form of CME. Macula OCT of the left eye (c) shows an atrophic thin retina with poorly defined layers. En face 3 \u00d7 3 mm OCTA in b and d demonstrates aneurysms and telangiectatic capillaries in deep and superficial capillary plexuses with sparse and distorted vessels in superficial plexus (left frames in b, d) and diffuse vascular rarefaction and dropout, telangiectatic vessels, and FAZ enlargement in deep capillary plexus (right frames in b, d), more prominent in the right eye (b). \n\nThe 3 \u00d7 3 mm en face OCT angiography (OCTA) visualized aneurysms and telangiectasia in capillaries of deep and superficial capillary plexuses of the retina. In addition, vessels in the superficial plexus were sparse, distorted, and elongated with decreased density. More affected, deep capillary plexus showed diffuse rarefaction, telangiectasia, blunting of capillaries, and enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and perifoveal capillary loss, which were more prominent in the right eye (Fig. 2b, d).\n\nRight eye fundus autofluorescence imaging showed florid-like hyper-autofluorescence, suggesting CME (Fig. 3a, d). Fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed dilated capillary bed in the parafoveal area, bordering capillary-free zone in both eyes. Also, pooling in the aneurysms and late intraretinal staining in the region of telangiectasia occurred, being more prominent in the right eye. The FAZ was enlarged and regions of capillary dropout were observed in the perifoveal area of both eyes (Fig. 3b, c, e, f).\n\nFig. 3 Fundus autofluorescence of right (a) and left (d) eye demonstrate florid-like hyper-autofluorescence in the right eye (a), suggesting CME. Fluorescein angiography of the right (b, c) and left (e, f) eye visualized numerous aneurysms that pool fluorescein, telangiectasia in the parafoveal area, enlarged FAZ, as well as small area with perifoveal capillary dropout, more prominent in the right eye (b, c) Full size image\n\nWe requested a neurological consultation for our patient to search for neurological impairment such as stroke, vasculitis, or white matter lesion. The result was as follows: The patient is alert and oriented with normal speech. Sensory or motor deficit is absent. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are brisk, 2+, and symmetric in limbs. Babinski reflex is negative, and examination cranial nerves reveals them to be intact. Cerebellar tests such as finger to nose and heel to shin is smooth without dysmetria. Coordination is intact measured by walk toe\u2013heel. Gait is steady with normal base. According to the possible chances of associated neurological deficits, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered and came back as unremarkable.\n\nExtensive systemic workup was also undertaken to search for an underlying etiology. Laboratory investigations including coagulation tests, blood chemistries, renal and liver function tests, urinalysis, and microbiologic studies showed no abnormalities. The results are as follows: Complete blood count: RBC: 5.22 (\u00d7 10^6/microL), Hct: 38.2%, HGB: 12.2 g/dL, WBC: 7.8 (\u00d7 10^3/microL), Plt: 290 (\u00d7 10^3/microL); liver function test: SGPT: 21 (U/L), SGOT: 30 (U/L) ALP: 300 (U/L); renal function test: BUN: 8 mg/dL Cr: 0.95 mg/dL; urinalysis: color: yellow, clear with negative protein, ketone, bilirubin and nitrates, pH: 6.0, specific gravity: 1.015; FBS: 78 mg/dL. Serology testing result was as follows: TB (IGRA), Toxoplasma IgG and IgM (0.1 CLIA), HIV, VDRL, RPR as well as FTA-ABS, and CRP were all negative. Anti dsDNA (10 IU/ml), ANA, anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) and p-ANCA, lupus anticoagulant (0.95) and anticardiolipin (0.1 AEU), and serum complement (95 mg/dL) were all negative. Serum protein electrophoresis, serum cryoglobulin (115 mg/dL) was within normal range. ESR (30 mm/hr), Ca: 9.6 mg/dL, P: 4.1 mg/dL, PT: 13 seconds and PTT: 31 seconds were all unremarkable.\n\nWe suggested an anti-VEGF injection in her right eye with macular edema. The left eye with atrophic retina remained untreated. Injection of intravitreal bevacizumab was not effective for the right eye, with no improvement.

He denied any allergies, history of sexually transmitted infections, smoking, and drinking, and had had no surgeries in the past. He had been administered broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone 2 g) intravenously following the suture, with no improvement. Untreated, such symptoms rapidly destroy the gliding mechanism, causing adhesion formation and giving rise to necrosis. Afterward, the patient began to experience pain and swelling at the injured finger, later over his entire hand and wrist area. The middle finger had blisters and started to blacken (Figs. 1 and 2).\n\nFig. 1 Swelling, blackening, and swelling of the hand, in dorsal and palmar aspect Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Swelling, blackening, and swelling of the hand, in dorsal and palmar aspect Full size image\n\nOn physical examination, the initial wound was nowhere to be found.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed shift of the descending and sigmoid colon toward the right side with dilation , but there were no significant findings suggestive of the reason for acute abdominal pain. The patient revisited hospital the next day with continuous lower abdominal pain and bloody stool. Vital signs were oxygen saturation 97% under room air, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, pulse 106 beats/minute, blood pressure 173/97 mmHg, and body temperature 37.6 \u00b0C. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension and tenderness. Blood examination showed white blood cell (WBC) 11320/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 3.81 mg/dL, and hemoglobin (Hb) 8.7 g/dL. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.467, pO2 94.2 mmHg, pCO2 34.9 mmHg, HCO3 24.6 mmol/L, base excess (BE) 1.1 mmol/L, and lactate (Lac) 0.7 mmol/L (). Secondary abdominal CT showed strangulation and dilation of the sigmoid colon in the pelvic space, although there was no perceptible free air or ascites . The descending colon was running more to the medial side, similar to in the first CT image . The patient underwent endoscopic reduction with PDM . Endoscopic reduction failed to release the volvulus, however, and emergency surgery was performed.\n\nFig. 1 First abdominal CT shows dilated sigmoid colon on the right side (arrows) and shifted descending colon towards the medial side (arrowheads) (a). Second abdominal CT shows strangulation (arrows) and the oral dilated sigmoid colon (arrowheads) (b).

The patient presented with PDM (d) Full size image  preoperative blood examination and blood gas analysis Full size table\n\nOperative findings The procedure was performed laparoscopically. Dilated sigmoid colon with partial poorly colored region was seen within the pelvic cavity . Strangulation of the sigmoid colon was detected (Fig. 2a, b) and released as soon as possible . The descending colon was running more to the medial side with adherence to small intestinal mesentery , suggesting PDM. The sigmoid colon had shortened mesentery . Detachment of the adhesion between the descending colon and small intestinal mesentery, dissection of the sigmoid colonic mesentery toward the root of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), and identification of the root of the IMA, were by medial approach. There was no Toldt\u2019s fusion fascia at the descending colon, so the abdominal cavity at the lateral side of the descending colon was reached directly . PDM was therefore diagnosed due to abnormality of fixation of the descending colon. Detaching the partial adhesion between the colon and the abdominal wall, we dissected the sigmoid colon while preserving the superior rectal artery (SRA). Elongating the wound site and pulling out the sigmoid colon, we resected the sigmoid colon including the poorly colored segment. The left colonic artery (LCA) was not dissected because there was a possibility of colonic ischemia due to shortened sigmoid mesentery. Colon\u2013colon anastomosis was made by circular stapler. Inserting the drain into the pelvic bottom and washing the abdominal cavity, we finished the operation. The operation time was 182 minutes and the amount of blood loss was 108 mL.\n\nFig. 2 Operative findings revealed dilated sigmoid colon (arrows) and strangulation of the sigmoid colon (arrowheads) (a).

Physical examination revealed abdominal distension and tenderness. Blood tests showed white blood cell (WBC) count at 11320/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein (CRP) at 3.81 mg/dL, and hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.7 g/dL. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.467, pO2 94.2 mmHg, pCO2 34.9 mmHg, HCO3 24.6 mmol/L, base excess (BE) 1.1 mmol/L, and lactate (Lac) 0.7 mmol/L.\n\nA secondary abdominal CT scan was conducted, revealing dilation and possible strangulation of the sigmoid colon in the pelvic space, even though there was no visible free air or ascites. The descending colon appeared to have moved more towards the medial side, similar to the first CT image. \n\nIn light of the patient's symptoms and the CT findings, a salivary gland ultrasound was performed, revealing inflammation and swelling of the submandibular glands. This new finding, coupled with a slight elevation in his amylase levels - a detail noted upon re-evaluation of his blood test results - suggested a diagnosis of Sialoadenitis (inflammation of the salivary glands), despite the abdominal symptoms.\n\nThe patient underwent endoscopic reduction with PDM in an attempt to release what seemed to be a volvulus. However, the procedure failed to alleviate the symptoms, leading to an emergency surgery. \n\nDuring surgery, a dilated sigmoid colon and partial poorly colored region was seen within the pelvic cavity. Strangulation of the sigmoid colon was detected and released as soon as possible. The descending colon was found to be more medial with adherence to small intestinal mesentery. There was no Toldt\u2019s fusion fascia at the descending colon. Detaching the partial adhesion between the colon and the abdominal wall, the sigmoid colon was dissected while preserving the superior rectal artery (SRA). The sigmoid colon, including the poorly colored segment, was resected and a colon-colon anastomosis was performed. The procedure lasted 182 minutes with a blood loss of 108 mL.",

Physical examination revealed a pelvic mass touched on the dorsal side of the uterus. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a 6 \u00d7 5 cm cyst with solid parts on the left side of the uterus. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a multilocular cyst tumor, with solid components and a diameter of 6 cm, in the left ovary, and small-volume ascites. The tumor showed heterogeneity on the T2-weighted image and mostly low signal, but some high signal, which was not fat suppressed in T1-weighted images after fat suppression . Computed tomography (CT) showed no distant metastasis and no obvious abnormal accumulation in the thyroid gland. The patient\u2019s preoperative serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) was elevated to 84.9 U/ml (normal range <35.0), whereas the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC) were within their respective normal ranges.\n\nFig. 1 Magnetic resonance imaging findings.

The tumor showed heterogeneity in T2-weighted imaging. B In T1-weighted image, the tumor showed mostly low signal but some high signal. C In T1 fat-suppressed and contrast imaging, the tumor showed heterogeneous staining in the low-signal part in T1-weighted image.\n\nTotal abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and omentectomy were performed without any residual tumor because the intraoperative rapid histological diagnosis of the left ovarian tumor was suspicious for low-grade malignancy. The postoperative course, as well, was uneventful. Upon gross examination of the surgically resected specimen, the left ovary was whitish with tough elasticity, and the split surface was composed of polycystic formations with a solid area. Histologically, there were two patterns of histological subtypes: papillary carcinoma and poorly differentiated carcinoma . About 70% of the tumor was composed of follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland growing in a papillary fashion, while about 30% of the tumor had poorly differentiated carcinoma. In the area of the papillary carcinoma, the nuclei of the tumor cells were like \u201cground glass\u201d with coffee bean-like grooves . In the other area, full, nodular, and insular structures were observed, and nuclear fission images were confirmed . The immunohistochemical analysis showed that both components were positive for thyroglobulin; the Ki-67 (MIB-1) index was 5% in the papillary carcinoma and 35% in the poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\nFig. 2 Histological image of the ovary.

The patient had no history of smoking, alcohol, and opium use. She had a history of anxiety symptoms with no specific diagnosis. There was no travel history or unusual behavior. The patient had no classical risk factors for the development of opportunistic infection, prominent history of trauma, cosmetic lip tattoo, or burning in her lips. She had taken corticosteroid nasal spray for bronchitis. The clinical examination revealed an ill-demarcated, kissing ulcer associated thick, crusted area with a size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 cm on her lower lip. The ulcer was tender and discharged when pressed . There were no symptoms of interdigital intertrigo involvement nor signs of onychomycosis. The patient was not febrile, and there was no regional lymphadenopathy. The oral mucosa and tongue tissues were normal. Systemic general examinations were not noticeable. The results of screening for human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab), hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) were negative. At the onset of symptoms, she complained of dysphagia; however, she had typical results for endoscopic evaluation. Despite the local wound care and topical antifungal and antimicrobial therapy, immunosuppressive treatment with suspicion of immunobullous disorders and long-term antibiotic therapy worsened the wound. The clinical differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, other malignant lesions, ulcerative leishmaniasis, ulcerative mycobacterial infection, erosive lichen planus, immunobullous disorders, and opportunistic fungal infection was considered. Following these clinical manifestations, incisional skin biopsy samples were collected from the lower lip twice. Histopathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, severe acanthosis, spongiosis, and exocytosis of inflammatory cells in the epidermis accompanied by edema in papillary dermis with several inflammatory cells around blood vessels which were nonspecific . Direct immunofluorescence evaluation was negative for immunobullous diseases. The direct smear for leishmaniasis was negative. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test was negative.

Her father had a history of ESRD of unknown etiology and died from a myocardial infarction in his forties. She worked at T Mobile as a salesperson. She had not traveled outside of Illinois, which is where she was born and had lived her whole life. She denied alcohol or tobacco use and her only medication was loratadine as needed for allergic rhinitis. She underwent a renal biopsy and nine out of the twenty sampled glomeruli featured segmental or global scarring. In the non-globally sclerotic glomeruli, the glomerular tufts showed marked visceral epithelial cell proliferation and the glomerulus showed global collapse. Diffuse foot process effacement was present on electron micrography . Work-up for secondary causes was negative. She received oral prednisone and cyclosporine for about 2 years (dose unknown), achieved partial remission (defined as a reduction in proteinuria by 50% or more and stable renal function), and was maintained on oral losartan 100 mg daily.\n\n Patient characteristics at various timepoints of disease course\nFull size table\nFig. 1 a A silver stain showing parietal epithelial cell proliferation and collapse of the glomerular tuft. b An electron micrograph showing diffuse foot process effacement Full size image\n\nAt the age of 27, she presented to the hospital with several weeks of fever, sore throat, chest pain, and body aches. Outpatient testing for influenza, streptococcus, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus was negative. On admission, her temperature was 104.4 F, blood pressure 117/76 mmHg, and heart rate 114 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed a cooperative female in no acute distress, normal conjunctiva, unremarkable oropharynx without pharyngeal erythema, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, sinus tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs, clear lung fields, benign abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, diffuse joint tenderness but no joint swelling, no rash, normal gait, and intact cranial nerves, motor strength, sensation, and reflexes. Laboratory examination was significant for leukocytosis, acute on chronic kidney disease, nephrotic range proteinuria, and mild transaminitis. Serologies showed antinuclear antibodies (ANA) of 1:80, negative dsDNA, normal complement levels, rheumatoid factor (RF) of 60 IU/mL, negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type A (SSA) > 8, and negative anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type B (SSB). Ferritin was > 40,000 ng/mL (). Electrocardiogram (EKG) was noted to have diffuse ST segment elevations , troponin was 2 ng/mL, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild pericardial effusion ; this constellation was consistent with pericarditis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, pelvis (CAP) showed a small left sided pleural effusion . CT of the neck showed enlarged bilateral lymph nodes without evidence of abscess.\n\nFig. 2 Electrocardiogram with diffuse PR segment depression and ST segment elevation consistent with pericarditis Full size image\nFig.3 Transthoracic echocardiogram with mild pericardial effusion Full size image\nFig. 4 Computed tomography chest, abdomen, pelvis with small pleural effusion and atelectasis at left lung base Full size image\n\nAfter no underlying infectious or malignancy causes were identified, a primary rheumatological process was considered. She was given a trial of oral prednisone (60 mg daily), with resolution of fever and leukocytosis and symptomatic improvement. Oral colchicine (0.6 mg daily for 1 month) was added to treat the pericarditis. Repeat renal biopsy re-demonstrated the previous findings and, specifically, absence of SLE features. Her rheumatological presentation was felt to be most consistent with AoSD, given the fevers, arthralgias, leukocytosis, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, elevations in aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT), and the markedly elevated ferritin. Although she had a positive RF, her clinical presentation was not compatible with rheumatoid arthritis. Given her low titer ANA and positive SSA, the possibility of SLE was considered. She was maintained on oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily) and monitored closely in the rheumatology clinic, but over years of follow-up her presentation remained more consistent with AoSD rather than SLE. Additionally, she lacked signs or symptoms to suggest a diagnosis of Sjogren\u2019s disease.\n\nDuring follow-up in the rheumatology clinic, attempts to wean oral prednisone below 10 mg daily were unsuccessful, resulting in flares characterized by fevers, sore throat, facial swelling, arthralgias, myalgias, urticarial rash, flank pain, chest pain, and associated elevated inflammatory markers. Oral methotrexate (15 mg weekly) was added in August 2018 as a steroid sparing agent, with initial improvement. Due to a recurrence of pericardial effusion and inability to increase her methotrexate dose due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 4 weeks) was added in December 2018. Given continued disease activity, the patient was switched to subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg daily) in January 2020 and methotrexate and tocilizumab were discontinued. During this time, her condition remained stable on oral losartan (100 mg daily).\n\nHer rheumatologic disease was quiescent for several months on anakinra, but then the patient developed fever and dry cough requiring admission in March 2020. Infectious work up was negative. Laboratory work-up was concerning for flare of her AoSD although she lacked her usual symptoms of joint pain, sore throat, chest pain, and rashes (). She improved with an increased dose of oral prednisone to 30 mg daily. Shortly after that admission, she developed acute on chronic kidney injury with nephrotic range proteinuria and progression to ESRD. Her anakinra dose was reduced to every other day dosing to account for her ESRD.\n\nShe was admitted to the hospital in September 2020 for fever, malaise, headache, dyspnea, cough, and diarrhea. On presentation, her temperature was 101.4 F, blood pressure 97/55 mmHg, and heart rate 119 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing female, normal conjunctiva, unremarkable oropharynx without pharyngeal erythema, sinus tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs, clear lung fields, benign abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, unremarkable joint examination without evidence of synovitis, malar rash, chest hyperpigmentation, intact cranial nerves, left arm weakness, intact sensation, and intact reflexes. Anakinra was held due to her fevers and ongoing infectious work-up. Laboratory work-up was significant for leukocytosis, worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, and CK 4000 U/L (). CT CAP showed new splenomegaly as well as lymphadenopathy. The patient rapidly deteriorated, resulting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and death within a few days of admission. There was concern that she may have progressed to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (new cytopenia, splenomegaly, high-grade fevers, profoundly elevated ferritin) but additional supportive laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy were not obtained. Autopsy revealed bilateral lung consolidation with red hepatization of all five lobes, green\u2013black mucosal discoloration around the gastric fundus, and hepatosplenomegaly with liver weight of 211 g (expected 1500\u20131800 g) and spleen weight of 414 g (expected 125\u2013195 g).

Diagnostic testing was performed, ruling out syphilis, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, without gamma alteration in serum protein electrophoresis or any blood smear findings. No further autoantibody tests were performed. Corticosteroids were administered during 1 week at 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone doses together with intravenous immunoglobulins during 5 days, with complete resolution of ITP.\n\nAfter surgery, stage IIB (pT2aN1), moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed.

Eighteen months after finishing first-line chemotherapy, with maintained response, new pleural progression was evidenced, as confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan. It was thus decided to start a second line with atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody).\n\nTwo weeks after receiving immunotherapy, he presented to the emergency room with severe dyspnea accompanied by intense asthenia, myalgia, and fever of 39 \u00b0C. He denied contact with people suffering coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) infection. Upon presentation, he was conscious and alert with all neurological functions preserved, hemodynamically stable, tachypneic, with 93% oxygen saturation in room air. He looked pale and had bruises on both arms on physical examination. Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly stood out, and auscultation revealed an abolition of left lung sounds. A blood test confirmed moderate pancytopenia, glomerular filtration rate of 50 ml/minute (previously normal), an increase in acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein and ferritin), and elevated levels of D-dimer >20 times normal value (). A computerized angiotomography was performed with no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, neither lung infiltrates nor pleural effusion.\n\nDuring the next 24 hours, he started vomiting with an altered level of consciousness with drowsiness. He had miotic pupils, without other signs of neurological dysfunction. On examination, he had developed progressive jaundice with abdominal pain in the right flank. A few hours later, he suffered a tonic\u2013clonic seizure. Initially, COVID-19 was rejected, and blood tests were repeated at 24 hours, revealing pancytopenia, hyperbilirrubinemia, and hypertransaminitis. Head computed tomography (CT) was performed with no alterations, and a blood smear showed anisocytosis with some elliptocytes. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated due to neurological deterioration with a score of 8 on the Glasgow scale. After assessing the risks and benefits, no lumbar puncture was done. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started, but the possibility that it was a hemophagocytic syndrome was raised and a differential diagnosis was started. Serologies were negative for HSV1-2, CMV, EBV, HIV, HBV, HCV, and HLTV-1 viruses. Elevated IL-6 (19.4 pg/mL) and CD25 (6516 U/m) were found with normal angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. He had 110 CD4 and 620 CD8 lymphocytes with very low CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.18. H-score for hemophagocytic syndrome was 256 points (> 99% probability). Given the high suspicion, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was initiated using 20 mg dexamethasone bolus as 1 mg/kg equivalent of methylprednisolone since day 1. Finally, bone marrow biopsy was performed, showing reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis, and dysplastic signs in megakaryocytic and erythroid reactive lines.\n\nFig. 1 A Bone marrow biopsy with reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis (red arrow), and dysplastic signs in megakaryocytic and erythroid reactive lines. B, C Hepatic and spleen tissue with hemophagocytosis Full size image Severe pancytopenia persisted despite transfusions, so it was decided to initiate tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg, without success, so we continued with anakinra without analytical or neurological improvement during day 2. Treatment with mycophenolate mofetil was added on day 3 for the next two days and finally, 5 days after admission, etoposide 100 mg/m2. Without any clinical improvement, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, showing extensive white matter damage . To study the degree of brain involvement, an electroencephalogram was done and revealed symmetrical background activity consisting of a 2\u20134 Hz, bilateral, irregular, low-voltage rhythm with no reactivity to eyelid closure\u2013opening, corresponding to diffuse and severe degree brain involvement. Hence, it was decided to limit the therapeutic effort.\n\nFig. 2 MRI T1 and T2 sequences with extensive involvement of supra- and infratentorial white matter, with bilateral and asymmetric damage, deep and superficial, of corpus callosum and internal capsules.

He had 7000 platelets/mcL and a lung carcinoma measuring 4.6 cm was discovered incidentally. Diagnostic tests ruled out syphilis, hepatitis, and HIV infection. He showed no gamma alteration in serum protein electrophoresis or findings in blood smears. Administration of corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone doses together with intravenous immunoglobulins resulted in complete resolution of ITP.\n\nFollowing surgery, a moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, stage IIB (pT2aN1), was confirmed. Despite affected surgical margins, treatment with concurrent weekly docetaxel and radiotherapy was well-tolerated. Progression of the disease was evidenced by pleural thickening and effusion at an unspecified time after initial presentation. The pathological study revealed no targeted mutations and 22C3 immunohistochemistry assay showed PD-L1 <1% in tumor cells and 25% in stroma cells. First-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel resulted in partial response. Atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody) was started as a second line of therapy following the detection of new pleural progression via a PET scan, the timing of which is not specified.\n\nThe patient presented to the emergency room suffering from severe dyspnea, intense asthenia, myalgia, and fever of 39 \u00b0C shortly after receiving immunotherapy. He denied contact with individuals infected with COVID-19. Physical examination revealed pale skin, bruises on both arms, painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, and an absence of left lung sounds.

No signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, lung infiltrates, or pleural effusion were found on a CT scan.\n\nThe patient's condition deteriorated over an unspecified period, with symptoms including vomiting, drowsiness, progressive jaundice, abdominal pain in the right flank, and a tonic-clonic seizure. A head CT scan revealed no alterations and a blood smear showed anisocytosis with some elliptocytes. He was subsequently admitted to the ICU due to neurological deterioration. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was initiated and a differential diagnosis started for Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Tests for various viruses came back negative, but elevated IL-6 and CD25 levels were found, along with an H-score for HLH of 256 points (> 99% probability). High-dose corticosteroids were administered, and a bone marrow biopsy showed reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis, and signs of dysplasia in megakaryocytic and erythroid lines.\n\nDespite transfusions, severe pancytopenia persisted and treatment with tocilizumab, anakinra, mycophenolate mofetil, and etoposide was attempted over an unspecified period. An MRI revealed extensive white matter damage, and an electroencephalogram showed severe brain involvement. In light of these findings, further treatment was limited. An autopsy confirmed the HLH, affecting the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and central nervous system.",

    "original_case": "A 28-year-old Caucasian man with history of testicular cancer in remission presented with altered mental status, syncope, vertical gaze palsy, ataxia, and tremor. He was in his usual state of health until 2 years ago, when he noticed a large right testicular mass. Work-up revealed marginally enlarged intraabdominal lymph nodes without evidence of metastases. One and a half years ago, he underwent radical unilateral orchiectomy. Pathology revealed malignant mixed germ cell tumor with abundant necrosis, comprising 50% teratoma, 45% embryonal carcinoma, and 5% yolk sac tumor. The mixed germ cell tumor was limited to the testicle without evidence of invasion. Lymph nodes were not examined pathologically. Alpha fetal protein (AFP) was mildly elevated at 9 ng/mL (reference range: 0\u20136.7 ng/mL) and normalized postoperatively. The patient opted for surveillance instead of chemotherapy after consultation with an oncologist. Three months prior to admission, the patient started experiencing fatigue and weight gain of 18 kg over 2 months. He was diagnosed with hypogonadism based on a low testosterone level of 127 ng/dL and started testosterone supplementation. Three weeks prior to admission, he began experiencing difficulty with upward and downward gaze. His fatigue continued to worsen, and he stopped working. One week prior to admission, he developed confusion, which manifested in difficulty remembering his dogs\u2019 names and asking questions in strangely worded ways. He also developed bilateral tremor and ataxia, causing him to fall on a daily basis. The worsening of these neurological symptoms led him to present to the emergency department. While hospitalized, he had an episode of syncope. As this was being evaluated, he was noted to have hypovolemia due to polyuria, which was concerning for diabetes insipidus and, consequently, hypothalamic involvement of his underlying disease. Ultimately, the patient did not meet criteria for diabetes insipidus but did have elevated prolactin of 52.0 ng/mL, concerning for some hypothalamic injury. Due to suspicion that his condition could extend to the pituitary, the patient underwent testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The decreased levels of the above hormones revealed probable panhypopituitarism, with TSH of 0.11 mcIU/mL, free T4 of 1.0 ng/dL, ACTH of <2 pg/mL, LH of 0.5 pg/mL, and FSH of 1.3 mIU/mL. Of note, he was placed on high-dose steroids immediately and has consistently been on these higher-dose steroids, so he has been unable to undergo a cosyntropin test to confirm central adrenal insufficiency. He also underwent a neurologic work-up, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI imaging of the pituitary, which showed T2 prolongation involving the bilateral mesial temporal lobes, hippocampi/fornices, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies and mammillothalamic tracts, and midbrain including periaqueductal gray with normal pituitary (Figs. 1 and 2). His presentation was concerning for encephalitis involving subcortical white matter, deep brain structures, and dorsal midbrain. A lumbar puncture showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and was positive for oligoclonal bands. A broad infectious work-up was otherwise negative. He received high-dose steroids, five sessions of plasmapheresis, and 5 days of intravenous immunoglobulin, without significant improvement in his physical examination or mental status. Repeat ultrasound of the testes, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans, and AFP levels were all normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer. He was discharged with close follow-up.

Unfortunately, the patient did not make significant improvement after his hospitalization, losing the ability to walk and to clear his nasopharyngeal secretions. A few months later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) for progression of his condition, which was complicated by thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, sepsis, and worsening neurological status. During this hospitalization, the patient underwent tracheostomy and placement of a gastric tube. Repeat brain MRI showed similar areas of signal abnormality from prior brain MRI but with mildly decreased intensity . Repeat PET/CT scans and ultrasound of the testes were once again normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer or metastases. However, the patient was initiated on cyclophosphamide and lacosamide. Upon discharge, the patient continued with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, lacosamide, and levetiracetam. Now, 8 months after his initial hospitalization, the patient is closely followed by neurology and endocrinology and remains disoriented with fluctuating levels of alertness.

His initial birth weight was 2381 g (25\u201350th percentile). He failed his newborn pulse oximetry cardiac screen and was first seen by cardiology at 2 weeks of age. He was followed in the cardiology clinic again at 1 month of age. At that time, an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a sinus tachycardia of 200 beats per minute and hypertension. An echocardiogram was significant for left ventricular hypertrophy with septal wall thickness in diastole of 7 mm and a posterior wall measurement of 5 mm consistent with left ventricular noncompaction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype. He was also noted to have different skin tones and pigmentation from trunk to lower extremities. He was started on a beta-blocker with plans to follow up in clinic in 2 months and was referred to dermatology for evaluation of the skin lesions.  \nAt 6 weeks of age, he presented to the cardiomyopathy clinic owing to left ventricular hypertrophy and was also having difficulty feeding. He was then admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive. At admission, his weight was 3100 g (<\u20092nd percentile), length was 48 cm (3rd\u201310th percentile), and head circumference was 34 cm (<\u20092nd percentile). His physical examination findings were significant for hypertension (101/68 mmHg), tachycardia, facial fullness, hyperpigmented lesions on his skin, marked hypotonia, and hepatomegaly.

Genetics was consulted during the hospital admission. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the findings of adrenal fullness on a renal ultrasound in conjunction with the hyperpigmented lesion, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cardiomyopathy, and elevated liver function tests (LFT). Repeat echocardiograms showed persistent concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, with initial thickness of the left ventricular wall of 4.7 mm (Z-score 2.6) reaching a maximum of 7.1 mm (Z-score 1.7) (). Systemic hypertension was confirmed with systolic pressures up to 130 mmHg and diastolic pressures up to 77 mmHg.  \nFig. 1  \nSkeletal survey demonstrating polyostotic fibrous dysplasia; top left, right upper extremity; top right, left upper extremity; bottom left, left femur  \nFull size image  \n Measurement of left posterior wall thickness (LV PW) on each echocardiogram  \nFull size table  \nA renal ultrasound was negative for renal vein anomalies, and metanephrines were also found to be normal.

An abdominal ultrasound showed increased liver echogenicity, bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands, and bilateral nephrocalcinosis.  \nGiven the likelihood of the condition, evaluation was performed. Biochemical evaluation showed elevated serum cortisol without diurnal variation (8 a.m. cortisol at 38.2 \u03bcg/dL and 7 p.m. cortisol at 36.4 \u03bcg/dL; normal 2.8\u201323.0 \u03bcg/dL). Urinary free cortisol was elevated to 35 \u03bcg/dL/24 hours (reference range 3\u20139 \u03bcg/dL/24 hours) (Esoterix; Calabasas, CA). A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test revealed a cortisol of 38.2 \u03bcg/dL and an ACTH level of <\u20095 pg/mL; this was followed by a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test that showed a serum cortisol of 60.1 \u03bcg/dL. These results showed that failure to suppress cortisol was consistent with ACTH-independent condition.  \nA skin biopsy of a caf\u00e9-au-lait lesion on his back was obtained for gene analysis at All Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida and was negative.

She had experienced nausea and vomiting during the night prior to her presentation at the hospital coupled with inability to tolerate oral intake. Her presentation at the hospital was driven by worsening of these symptoms. She had history of intermittent burning type of epigastric pain prior to pregnancy. She also had contraction and leakage of liquor of 2 hours duration which started while on the way to our hospital. There was no history of vaginal bleeding. Upon arrival, the patient was in acute distress, with the following vital signs: blood pressure, 95/60 mmHg; pulse rate, 132 beats per minute (bpm); respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 35.9 \u00b0C. Abdominal examination showed a grossly distended, rigid, and diffusely tender abdomen, which showed limited movement with respiration. Uterine fundal height was consistent with the gestational age. There were three uterine contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting for 35\u201340 seconds. The fetal heart beat (FHB) ranged from 120 to 158 bpm.

His past medical history included hypertension, prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy, and a benign parotid tumor status post-parotidectomy 20 years prior. He was retired from working in corporate management, and family history was significant for lung cancer in his father and breast cancer in a sister. Comorbid illnesses included gastrointestinal reflux disease, for which he took ranitidine 150 mg daily and omeprazole 20 mg daily; hypertension, for which he took lisinopril 12.5 mg daily; hyperlipidemia, for which he took atorvastatin 20 mg daily; and seasonal allergies and asthma, for which he took montelukast 150 mg daily and loratadine 10 mg daily. He was also using naproxen and cannabis for cancer-related pain at time of presentation. He was a lifelong non-smoker and did not drink alcohol to excess. He first noticed his right neck mass while shaving 3 months prior to presentation. He reported some mild pain with swallowing, weight loss of unknown amount, right neck sensitivity to light touch, increased hoarseness, and a raspy voice. He was initially diagnosed by his primary care physician as having lymphadenopathy secondary to a sinus infection and received two rounds of antibiotics. The mass failed to improve and, as a result, a fine needle aspiration of the lesion was performed. Evaluation of the biopsy material demonstrated dysmorphic cells containing cytoplasmic keratin, which stained positively for CK5/6, consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma. Monoclonal PAX-8 (Biocare Medical, BC12) staining was also focally positive . Subsequent laryngoscopy revealed no mucosal lesions, but right vocal cord paralysis was observed. A CT of the neck with contrast revealed a 4.8 cm peripherally enhancing hypodense mass with central necrosis lateral to the right hyoid bone, emanating from the thyroid gland . Multiple smaller nodular lesions within the prevertebral space, right paraesophageal region, and superior mediastinum were also identified. A staging PET scan showed a hypermetabolic right thyroid lobe with extensive conglomerate pathologic adenopathy at the right cervical lymph node chain, extending inferior to the right thoracic inlet, as well as a left retropharyngeal hypermetabolic lymph node, but no evidence of distant metastasis (Fig. 2B and C). On initial physical and neurologic examination, the oncology team noted a large, firm, fixed right medial neck mass without overlying skin changes, and a normal cranial nerve exam.\n\nFig. 1 H&E stained cell block slides (A and B, 60X) demonstrating dysmorphic cells (arrows).

Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Pre-treatment diagnostic CT neck (A) and staging PET/CT (B, C) scan revealed a large right necrotic and PET-avid thyroid mass. Full size image\n\nThe patient\u2019s case was discussed at the head and neck multidisciplinary tumor board, with a consensus opinion that this squamous cell carcinoma was indeed of thyroid origin. Extensive surgical resection including a laryngectomy, thyroidectomy, and reconstruction followed by adjuvant chemoradiation as a potential curative course was recommended. However, due to the morbidity and lifestyle implications associated with surgery, the patient declined surgery and instead chose to pursue concurrent chemoradiation with weekly chemotherapy. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was used to treat the right thyroid mass to 70 Gy in 35 fractions at 200 cGy per fraction, as well as bilateral retropharyngeal nodes cervical neck nodal levels IB, II, III, IV, and V to 63 Gy in 35 fractions at 180 cGy per fraction . The patient completed radiation with weekly concurrent carboplatin-paclitaxel over 7 weeks. During treatment, he developed grade 2 fatigue, grade 2 mucositis, grade 2 dermatitis, grade 3 dysphagia, and grade 3 dry mouth with thickened secretions with excessive mucus. The skin desquamation was treated with silver sulfadiazine and mineral oil-hydrophil petrolat. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed during the first week of treatment due to nutrition and oral intake difficulties at baseline, and the patient lost less than 15 lbs throughout the treatment. Long-term toxicity was significant for chronic xerostomia and dysphagia, requiring a permanent gastrostomy tube. He also developed treatment-related hypothyroidism and was started on levothyroxine approximately 3 months after completion of treatment, when his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was found to have gone up from 1.63 (baseline, normal) to 21 mIU/mL (elevated).\n\nFig. 3 Axial view of patient\u2019s CT-based radiation treatment plan. 6 MV photon beams were utilized, and patient was prescribed to 7000 cGy in 35 fractions to the isocenter. Dose color wash is represented as a percentage relative to the prescribed 7000 cGy dose. Thyroid mass contours are delineated in red and are treated to 7000 cGy, while retropharyngeal and cervical neck nodal levels IB, II, III, and IV are delineated in yellow and treated to 6300 cGy. Full size image\n\nAfter receiving concurrent chemoradiation, the patient underwent two additional cycles of high-dose carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel every 3 weeks. Follow-up imaging after concurrent chemoradiation suggested a partial therapeutic response. PET (18-fluorodeoxyglucose/18-FDG)/CT of the neck demonstrated that the thyroid mass had decreased in size from 5.0 \u00d7 5.2 cm, with maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) of 35.3, to 3.8 \u00d7 2.1 cm, with maximum SUV of 19.4 (Fig. 4A\u2013C). This was also apparent on physical examination, where the tumor was smaller, softer, and less tender to palpation. The right and left neck lymph nodes were also notably smaller and demonstrated less PET-avidity. Imaging of the chest, however, revealed pulmonary metastases up to 9 mm in size, as well as multiple bilateral hypermetabolic nodules (Fig. 4D and E).\n\nFig. 4 Post-concurrent chemoradiation PET/CT imaging with carboplatin/paclitaxel reveal a smaller thyroid tumor size (A) and decreased PET-avidity (B, C), but show new bilateral pulmonary metastases (D, E).

However, he opted for immunotherapy instead due to previous chemotherapy side effects and subsequently completed nine cycles of pembrolizumab. Imaging studies obtained after the third cycle of pembrolizumab demonstrated an interval decrease in the size of multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally, suggesting a positive response to therapy . At the same time, however, a CT scan demonstrated an increase in the size of the thyroid mass . Additionally, new encasement of the distal common carotid artery, carotid bifurcation, and proximal internal carotid artery was present, and erosion of the thyroid cartilage was also identified. After the sixth cycle of pembrolizumab, imaging continued to demonstrate enlargement of the thyroid mass with increased extension to the tracheoesophageal groove, while the pulmonary nodules continued to get smaller (Fig. 5C and D). Following the ninth cycle of pembrolizumab, the thyroid mass had continued to enlarge, eroding the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, extending into the paraglottic space, and invading the cervical esophagus. No new or worsening pulmonary metastatic disease was identified at this time (Fig. 5E and F). The tenth cycle of pembrolizumab was halted due to leukocytosis (WBC 21.81 and ANC 19.05) and the patient\u2019s desire to pursue supportive care. Fifteen months after his initial diagnosis, the patient was transitioned to comfort care and died 3 months later. Autopsy was not performed as the patient\u2019s desire was to donate his body to science.\n\nFig. 5 Post-immunotherapy CT imaging demonstrates enlarging thyroid tumor but stable (white arrows) or decreased pulmonary metastases (dotted arrows) after three cycles (A, B), six cycles (C, D), and nine cycles (D, E) of pembrolizumab.

    "rewritten_case": "We report an intriguing case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male. He had a past medical history of hypertension, prostate cancer managed with androgen deprivation therapy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy, and a benign parotid tumor post-parotidectomy 20 years ago. He was a retired corporate manager and had a family history of lung cancer in his father and breast cancer in his sister. His comorbid conditions included gastroesophageal reflux disease treated with ranitidine 150 mg daily and omeprazole 20 mg daily; hypertension managed with lisinopril 12.5 mg daily; hyperlipidemia treated with atorvastatin 20 mg daily; and seasonal allergies and asthma treated with montelukast 150 mg daily and loratadine 10 mg daily. He used naproxen and cannabis for cancer-related pain at the time of presentation. He was a lifelong non-smoker and moderate alcohol consumer.\n\nHe first observed a mass on his right neck while shaving three months prior to presentation. He reported mild pain with swallowing, weight loss of unknown magnitude, heightened right neck sensitivity to light touch, increased hoarseness, and a raspy voice. His primary care physician initially suspected lymphadenopathy due to sinus infection and prescribed two courses of antibiotics. When the mass persisted, a fine needle aspiration of the lesion was performed.\n\nThe biopsy material contained dysmorphic cells with cytoplasmic keratin, which stained positively for CK5/6, suggestive of a squamous cell neoplasm. However, monoclonal PAX-8 (Biocare Medical, BC12) staining was also focally positive, introducing ambiguity in the diagnosis. A follow-up laryngoscopy revealed no mucosal lesions but showed right vocal cord paralysis. A CT scan of the neck with contrast showed a 4.8 cm hypodense mass with peripheral enhancement and central necrosis lateral to the right hyoid bone, originating from the thyroid gland, with multiple smaller nodular lesions in the prevertebral space, right paraesophageal region, and superior mediastinum. A staging PET scan showed a hypermetabolic right thyroid lobe with extensive adenopathy at the right cervical lymph node chain, a left retropharyngeal hypermetabolic lymph node, but no evidence of distant metastasis.\n\nThe patient\u2019s case was presented at the head and neck multidisciplinary tumor board. The board speculated that the squamous cell neoplasm was of thyroid origin, but the focal PAX-8 staining raised questions about whether this could represent a neoplasm of uncertain behavior of the thyroid gland. They recommended extensive surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiation. However, considering the potential side effects and lifestyle changes, the patient opted for concurrent chemoradiation with weekly chemotherapy. The patient also developed treatment-related hypothyroidism and was started on levothyroxine approximately 3 months after treatment completion.\n\nFollow-up imaging showed a partial therapeutic response, with a decrease in thyroid mass size and reduction in PET-avidity. However, imaging of the chest revealed pulmonary nodules, indicative of potential metastatic disease. Despite the new findings, the patient opted for immunotherapy due to previous chemotherapy side effects. Following the ninth cycle of pembrolizumab, the thyroid mass had continued to enlarge, invading the thyroid and cricoid cartilages and the cervical esophagus. No new or worsening pulmonary metastatic disease was identified.\n\nThe patient was transitioned to comfort care 15 months after the initial diagnosis and passed away 3 months later. Autopsy was not performed per the patient's wish to donate his body to science. The initial diagnosis of a neoplasm of uncertain behavior of the thyroid gland, due to the peculiar PAX-8 staining, remained a point of discussion, although the clinical course suggested a more aggressive squamous cell carcinoma",

    "original_case": "The first case was a 49-year-old Saudi man who was found unconscious by his brother. He was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical services (EMS). On arrival, he showed decreased consciousness, hyperventilation, low-grade fever, and tachycardia. His family initially suspected that his condition was attributable to a drug overdose. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated because his Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score remained 9 despite efforts to stimulate and resuscitate him. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 136/84 mmHg; heart rate, 145 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 56 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 10 mmol/L. His physical examination was unremarkable apart from the presence of bilateral pinpoint pupils. After initial stabilization in the ED, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of low GCS and unstable vitals. He was maintained on mechanical ventilatory support and vasopressors because of hypotension. During the second day of his stay in the ICU, he started to show signs of worsening mental status and his computed tomography (CT) scan showed evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. His stay was complicated by ongoing evidence of sepsis and end organ damage represented by acute kidney impairment, worsening coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and positive blood culture screen, with evidence of infective endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography. This was managed by antibiotics and aggressive fluid and inotropic support. One week after admission, he showed no improvement in mental status and worsening neurological weakness. His repeated magnetic resonance imaging showed new middle cerebral artery infarction and the possibility of multiple infarcts. Attempts at weaning him from ventilatory support were unsuccessful and ended with placement of tracheostomy insertion. The patient was discharged on nasogastric and tracheostomy tubes in a stable condition but with poor functional state.\n\nOur second patient was a 24-year-old man who was brought to our institution by EMS after a road traffic accident. Upon initial assessment, he was found to be intoxicated and agitated. His GCS score was 13. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 114/61 mmHg; heart rate, 95 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% on room air; and glucose level, 5.7 mmol/L. His initial examination showed a red left eye but was otherwise unremarkable; furthermore, his extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST) examination was negative. Apart from agitation, the findings of the patient\u2019s physical examination were normal. The patient was hemodynamically stable upon assessment, with no signs of bleeding or other obvious injuries. He was acidotic with a pH of 7.25, and his HCO3 level was 10 mEq/L, as determined by analysis of the initial venous blood gas sample. Serum osmolality was 290 mOsm/kg. He received a fomepizole infusion; however, soon after sobering and admission, he discharged himself against medical advice.\n\nThe third patient was a 26-year-old man with no history of serious diseases, who presented to the ED complaining of blurry vision, vomiting, and hyperventilation that started the previous day after the consumption of an unknown amount of alcohol. He was alert and oriented to time, place, and person, with a GCS score of 15. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 141/75 mmHg; heart rate, 92 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 100% in room air; and glucose level, 5.2 mmol/L. Analysis of his venous blood sample showed a pH of 6.9, and the HCO3 level was 5.7 mEq/L. The anion gap in his serum sample was 20 mEq/L, with a measured osmolality of 310 mOsm/kg (reference range, 275\u2013295 mOsm/kg). His vision continued to diminish after admission. His management included fomepizole infusion, hemodialysis, thiamine infusion, and application of sodium bicarbonate boluses. Two days after admission, his laboratory markers normalized and he was discharged back to his normal condition, except for his vision derangement where he was referred to an ophthalmology specialized clinic where follow-up was lost.\n\nOur fourth patient was a 25-year-old woman with a history of iron deficiency anemia who presented to the ED complaining of shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, left flank pain, blurry vision, and palpitations. These symptoms had progressed over the last 3 days with alcohol consumption before she presented at our institution. The patient was conscious and oriented to time, place, and person. Her initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 138/94 mmHg; heart rate, 104 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 4.7 mmol/L. Her venous blood gas pH was 7.32 and HCO3 level was 15 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 280 mOsm/kg and the anion gap was 15 mEq/L. During admission, she received four doses of fomepizole infusion as per the institution poison control center protocol (0.9 g intravenous loading dose then 0.6 g q 12 hours). After completion of therapy, she was discharged home in her normal baseline condition.\n\nThe fifth patient was a 20-year-old woman who had been admitted and treated in another hospital for 1 week for acidosis and intoxication. She presented to our ED complaining of a 2-day history of bilateral complete vision loss. She had no other complaints. Her initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 107/55 mmHg; heart rate, 54 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 99% in room air; and glucose level, 6 mmol/L. Her venous blood gas pH was 7.3 and HCO3 level was 14.9 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 278 mOsm/kg, and the anion gap was 15 mEq/L. Upon admission, the patient received fomepizole infusion and was admitted for 3 days, during which time her condition improved, and she regained her vision. No hemodialysis was required. Patient was lost to follow-up after referral to ophthalmology.\n\nOur sixth patient was a 27-year-old man who presented with complaints of vomiting and severe abdominal pain, restlessness, and blurry vision after alcohol consumption 2 days prior to his visit to our institution. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 134/90 mmHg; heart rate, 84 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 4.7 mmol/L. His venous blood gas showed a pH of 7.1, and the HCO3 level was 5 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 296 mOsm/kg and the anion gap was 33 mEq/L. Fomepizole, thiamine, folic acid, sodium bicarbonate infusion, and hemodialysis treatment were started. During his hospital stay, he received fomepizole as per the poison control center institution protocol (15 mg/kg intravenous loading dose of fomepizole followed by 10 mg/kg q 6 hours during his dialysis). He remained on continuous renal replacement therapy for 24 hours. He was discharged the next day after improvement and resolution of all his symptoms.\n\nThe seventh patient was a 36-year-old man who presented with complaints of fatigue, loss of appetite, and chest pain after consumption of alcohol 2 days prior to his visit to our institution. He had no visual symptoms and his GCS score was 15. The initial pH of his venous blood gas was 7.2, and the HCO3 level was 15 mEq/L. Serum osmolality was 277 mOsm/kg. He was administered fomepizole, folic acid, and sodium bicarbonate treatments and was soon discharged in good condition.\n\nOur eighth patient was a 19-year-old woman with no history of serious diseases, who presented with acidosis, abdominal pain, vomiting, and blurred vision 2 days after the consumption of contaminated alcohol. The pH of her venous blood gas was 7.1, and the serum osmolality was 278 mOsm/kg. She was started on continuous renal replacement therapy upon admission, and given fomepizole, folinic acid, bicarbonate infusion until resolution of her symptoms was achieved. She was discharged back to her normal healthy baseline, with a referral to ophthalmology for follow-up.\n\nThe ninth patient was a 20-year-old woman who developed abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and blurred vision after attending a party. Analysis of her venous blood sample showed a pH of 7.34 and HCO3 level of 18 mEq/L. She was started on continuous renal replacement therapy upon admission and started on fomepizole infusion as per the poison control center institution protocol (15 mg/kg intravenous loading dose of fomepizole followed by 10 mg/kg q 6 hours during dialysis). She continued on treatment until resolution of her symptoms the next day. She was discharged back to her normal healthy baseline, with a referral to ophthalmology for follow-up.",

    "original_case": "A 35-year-old Mediterranean woman was diagnosed with a condition at the age of 7, when she was investigated for hematuria and proteinuria, confirmed by a renal biopsy on her father, revealing a familial chronic renal disease. Our patient was descended from a nonconsanguineous parent. Her mother was completely asymptomatic, while her father had been diagnosed with the same condition when he was 42 years of age, and he had been on hemodialysis for the last few years because of chronic renal failure. The pattern of this disease inheritance in her family suggested an X-linked type, as her brothers were asymptomatic. At the same time, her only sister had shown hematuria since she was a teenager. Genetic testing was offered to the patient and her offspring but declined as the test was not insured financially.\n\nAfter three successful pregnancies and 3 years from her last delivery, the patient is normotensive, had a normal kidney function test, and was not undergoing any specific treatment. However, recently she had been found to have some auditory changes from tinnitus, mild neurosensory hearing loss, and mild lenticular myopia caused by her anterior lenticonus.\n\nFirst pregnancy (2009)  \nAt the age of 23, the patient came to the antenatal clinics at 7 weeks of gestation, and an early ultrasound examination confirmed a pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and the blood pressure was 90/70 mmHg. Her baseline investigations showed a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dl, 2+ protein from urine analysis, and serum creatinine of 41 \u00b5mol/l (62.0\u2013106.0 \u00b5mol/l). Twenty-four-hour urine collection measured 1.870 g protein. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth assessment, proteinuria, and kidney function testing. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted to the obstetric unit for monitoring because of rising proteinuria of 4.300 g in 24 hours and a borderline amniotic fluid index at 34 weeks. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg.\n\nAt 37 weeks of gestation, 24-hour urine collection measured 5.694 g protein, creatinine 49 \u00b5mol/l, total protein 53.4 g/l (60\u201380 g/l), and albumin at 27.8 g/l (35\u201352 g/l). She had a cesarean section at 37 completed weeks for an obstetric reason (breech presentation) and delivered a healthy, 2530 g female newborn baby. Proteinuria dropped down to the early pregnancy levels shortly after delivery. The patient recovered smoothly after surgery and was discharged home with her newborn infant. The patient had a follow-up visit at the nephrology clinic after 2 weeks of her puerperium, which revealed proteinuria of +2 and creatinine of 52 \u00b5mol/l. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the second pregnancy.\n\nSecond pregnancy (2015)  \nAt age 30, the patient came once more to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 13 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg. There was a +1 protein in the urine, and the creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth and fetal well-being assessments, as well as the recording of proteinuria and creatinine levels. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted at 30 weeks of gestation so that her borderline amniotic fluid index could be assessed. At 34 weeks of gestation, the patient had an elevated blood pressure of 140/89 mmHg, for which she was again admitted to the hospital for observation. Proteinuria was 3.900 g in a 24-hour collection, serum creatinine was 44 \u00b5mol/l, hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dl, and the platelet count was 222 \u00d7 10^3/mm^3. The total serum protein was 51 g/l, albumin was 27.0 g/l, normal levels of alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase being 8.9 U/l and 15 U/l, respectively. She had a cesarean section due to a suspected dehiscence scar and gave birth to a male newborn infant weighing 2300 g, who was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The mother\u2019s proteinuria and blood pressure dropped shortly after 2 weeks of her delivery. The mother and the newborn infant were discharged home in good health. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the third pregnancy.\n\nThird pregnancy (2017)  \nAt age 32, the patient presented to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 12 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. A 24-hour urine collection showed 1.010 g in 2400 ml. The serum creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetrics and nephrology care was established with serial growth and fetal well-being assessment. At 28 weeks, during a routine antenatal visit, a dipstick for protein showed +3, while the 24-hour urine collection revealed 2.400 g in 1300 ml. Her blood pressure was normal all through her antenatal period. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. At 34 weeks, the protein in the 24-hour urine collection measured 2.900 g in 1200 ml, while serum creatinine was 45 \u00b5mol/l and hemoglobin level 9.1 g/dl. A cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks for obstetric reasons, and a male newborn of 2500 g was delivered and sent to the nursery. After 2 days, the mother and her newborn infant were discharged home. After 4 weeks, the patient was reevaluated once more, and she was doing well, with a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg and a 24-hour urine collection measuring 1.700 g in 2200 ml. There were no auditory or ophthalmological complaints. Late follow-up was lost apart from a few visits documented to the auditory and ophthalmology clinics.",

Her father, who was diagnosed with the same condition later in his life, had been undergoing hemodialysis due to chronic renal failure. Her mother, however, was completely asymptomatic, as were her brothers. Her sister, on the other hand, had exhibited hematuria since her adolescence. The pattern of inheritance suggested an X-linked type of the disease. Despite the genetic implications, the patient and her offspring declined genetic testing due to lack of financial insurance.\n\nNow, the woman, who had three successful pregnancies, was normotensive, had normal kidney function, and was not undergoing any specific treatment. She did, however, present with certain recent auditory changes - tinnitus, mild neurosensory hearing loss, and mild lenticular myopia caused by anterior lenticonus.\n\nDuring her first pregnancy, she was referred to both the antenatal and nephrology clinics due to her health history. Her blood pressure was normal and baseline investigations showed a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dl, 2+ protein from urine analysis, and serum creatinine of 41 \u00b5mol/l. As her proteinuria increased and the amniotic fluid index became borderline at one point, she was admitted to the obstetric unit for monitoring. She eventually had a cesarean section for a breech presentation and delivered a healthy baby girl. Her proteinuria returned to pre-pregnancy levels soon after delivery, and she recovered well post-surgery.\n\nDuring her second pregnancy, she was referred to the antenatal clinics once again. Her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg, and there was a +1 protein in her urine. Despite a brief period of elevated blood pressure and increased proteinuria, she had a cesarean section due to a suspected dehiscence scar and delivered a healthy baby boy who was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Her proteinuria and blood pressure returned to normal levels a few weeks post-delivery.\n\nIn her third pregnancy, she was under the combined care of obstetrics and nephrology. Her blood pressure was normal, but proteinuria was present. Despite being closely monitored for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia, she remained normotensive throughout her antenatal period. She had a cesarean section due to obstetric reasons and delivered a healthy baby boy. Her post-pregnancy evaluation showed she was doing well with normal blood pressure and reduced proteinuria. She reported no auditory or ophthalmological complaints.",

    "original_case": "A 48-year-old Japanese woman with a recent history of COVID-19 presented with fatigue, palpitation, back pain, abdominal discomfort, and loss of appetite 3 days after the quarantine period. She had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 5 weeks before her visit, which was detected because she was in close contact with her husband who had COVID-19. She remained asymptomatic for 10 days during the COVID-19 isolation period; however, she began to feel general fatigue and back pain 3 days later. She complained of bilateral upper back pain without irradiation. This condition was moderate in severity and was not relieved by rest. Her appetite was hindered owing to abdominal bloating, frequent belching, and constipation. She lost 4 kg of weight in 3 weeks and was admitted to the hospital. She had a history of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and oral allergy syndrome to melon and watermelon with eosinophilia. Absolute eosinophil count was 1645/\u00b5L, 26% of white blood cell count, on the laboratory data 1 year before. Although she had been experiencing numbness in her bilateral hands for 3 months, she did not take it seriously, assuming it was due to her daily manual labor. A month before, she had been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome at another clinic. She was given a budesonide/formoterol inhaler, montelukast, theophylline, mirogabalin, and methyl-cobalamin, which is conventionally prescribed for peripheral neuropathy in Japan. Her blood pressure was 142/115 mmHg, pulse rate was 113 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on ambient air.

    "original_case": "A 68-year-old Caucasian male was referred to the emergency department with progressive complaints of fatigue, dyspnea, and poor appetite since 12 days. He had also fallen down and needed help getting back up. The patient was a retiree who had previously worked in law enforcement. He had no significant past medical history and did not take regular medications. He had a long-term history of smoking (80 pack-years) and consumed three alcoholic drinks daily. His general practitioner had noted a new diabetes mellitus with a glucose of 28 mmol/L when the patient presented in his practice 5 days earlier, but had not started treatment. The patient did not report coughing, chills, or chest pain. On physical examination, he appeared dyspneic and had an altered mental status but could still speak complete sentences. He had a blood pressure of 141/105 mmHg, pulse rate of 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% without supplemental oxygen, and temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. He had cold extremities with a capillary refill < 3 seconds. No other signs such as peripheral edema, heart murmurs, pericardial friction rub, or pulmonary crackles were present. Excepting the altered mental status, the global neurological examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 341 mg/L, neutrophilic leukocytosis with leukocyte count of 12.6 \u00d7 10^9/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 96 mmol/mol, mildly elevated hepatic transaminases, and low serum myocardial markers. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed partially compensated respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.49, pCO2 3.5 kPa, pO2 12.6 kPa, HCO3 19.4 mmol/L, base excess \u22122.4 mmol/L, sO2 97%) (see Additional file 1 for all laboratory values at first presentation). Chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis but no evident pleural effusion or infiltration . Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a QS pattern in V1\u20134, suggestive of an old anterior wall myocardial infarction. Point-of-care echocardiography was performed and visualized large, circumferential pericardial effusion . Also, wall motion abnormalities were seen that supported the theory that the patient had experienced an out-of-hospital anterior myocardial infarction in the weeks to months before the current presentation. The day after admission, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed with immediate drainage of 600 mL of purulent fluid. Analysis of the fluid indicated a leukocyte count of 267 \u00d7 10^9/L, total protein of 51 g/L, and lactate dehydrogenase pericardial fluid-to-serum ratio of 8.7. As Gram stains of blood revealed Gram-positive diplococci, antibiotic therapy consisting of continuous, intravenous infusion with 6 million international units benzylpenicillin daily was initiated. At admission, blood culture specimens for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria had been collected and directly transported to a BacT/Alert Virtuo system (BioM\u00e9rieux). Later on, these blood cultures as well as pericardial fluid cultures grew (serotype unknown). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that the isolated strain was susceptible to a variety of antibiotics including penicillin, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.016 mg/L. Initially, insulin and metformin were started for the newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Acetylsalicylic acid and low-molecular-weight heparin were started to prevent occlusive vascular events. Moreover, during the admission, several other medications were started for cardiovascular protection, to treat electrolyte imbalances, and to supplement vitamins because of the previous alcohol use (see Additional file 2 for all medication administered during admission). \n\nFig. 1 Chest X-ray showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis with mild volume loss.

LV left ventricle, RV right ventricle Full size image \n\nIn the days following pericardiocentesis, a further 635 mL of purulent pericardial fluid was drained through the pericardial catheter and the patient\u2019s clinical condition improved markedly. Daily, bedside transthoracic echocardiography confirmed adequate drainage of the pericardial effusion. The patient did not develop any symptoms that pointed us in the direction of a primary focus (for instance, no coughing, urinary complaints, or back pains). Repeated chest X-rays did not show signs of pneumonia or empyema. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody assay was negative, as were tests for other microorganisms (ELISpot for detection of M. tuberculosis; hepatitis C virus serology; and feces assays for C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and norovirus). The CRP level dropped to 102 mg/L. However, 6 days post-admission, the patient\u2019s condition suddenly deteriorated with a blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg, sinus tachycardia of 131 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute. A small amount of sanguineous fluid drained through the pericardial catheter. Echocardiography revealed reaccumulation of pericardial fluid including blood clot formation at the level of the right chamber in the pericardial cavity. Moreover, the wide inferior vena cava, right ventricular compression, and increased respiratory inflow variation (> 25%) over the mitral valve were indicative of cardiac tamponade. Attempts to clear the drain blockage by flushing with saline and adjusting the catheter\u2019s location in the pericardial cavity did not lead to evacuation of any pericardial fluid. Thus, as removal of the obstructing blood clot through the pericardial catheter proved impossible, the patient was transferred to a tertiary hospital to undergo emergent cardiothoracic surgery. Immediately before transfer, the patient went into cardiac arrest and he was ultimately transported with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Unfortunately, surgical removal of the clot proved unsuccessful, and the patient died only hours after onset of his sudden hemodynamic deterioration. In consultation with the family, no autopsy was performed.",

    "original_case": "A 36-year-old nulliparous Nigerian petty trader presented at the gynecology outpatient clinic with a painless abdominal mass of 1-year duration. The mass first appeared as a small induration and progressively increased in size. She had menarche at age 14 years, with 3 days of menstruation in a 28-day cycle. There was no history of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and bowel or urinary change, and no significant past medical history although she was taking the antihypertensive amlodipine (tablet, 10 mg daily) for hypertension. She had a surgical history of open myomectomy for symptomatic fibroids 3 years prior to presentation. There was no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus, asthma, cancer or sickle cell disease. She defined herself as a social drinker and non-smoker (no history of smoking). The results of a prior ultrasound examination at a different hospital suggested a condition, and based on this scan, she was offered a hysterectomy at that hospital prior to her presentation at our own facility. General and neurological examinations were unremarkable, with a pulse rate of 74 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, and a body temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. Abdominal with bimanual pelvic examination revealed a giant abdominopelvic mass, equivalent to a 36-week gestational uterus, extending in all directions to fill the abdominal cavity. It was not attached to the overlying structures but seemed to have originated from the pelvic cavity. Subsequently, based on evidence of this abdominopelvic mass, we carried out a preoperative work-up, with the results showing a packed cell volume (PCV) of 36%, fasting blood sugar of 80 mg/dl, blood group O+ (positive), sero-negativity for hepatitis B and C, and normal values for urinalysis, electrolytes, urea, and creatinine. The abdominopelvic scan revealed an anteverted, empty, and markedly bulky uterus that measured about 283 \u00d7 156 mm, with the fundus close to the xiphisternum. The endometrial stripe measured about 4 mm in thickness, with what appeared to be diffuse enlargement of the uterine myometrium with no succinct myometrial mass. There was no adnexal mass and no fluid in the Pouch of Douglas. The visceral organs showed nothing of significance. A computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were not performed due to the unavailability of these facilities. Two units of whole blood were cross matched for her, and she then underwent an exploratory laparotomy for the excision of the tumor. Intra-operation findings included a huge 6.5-kg abdominal mass of firm consistency and 40 cm in diameter . There was adhesion of the omentum with markedly enlarged omental vessels. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries appeared to be normal. There was no retroperitoneal involvement. However, there was an extension of the tumor to the left sub-umbilical part of the abdominal wall. Complete excision of the tumor with a wide margin and partial omentectomy was carried out, and the anterior abdominal wall was closed in layers without prosthesis. The postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. The histology study showed a specific type of fibromatosis with an unremarkable fibrofatty tissue stalk excision margin (Fig. 2 a, b).",

The mass initially emerged as a minor induration and gradually enlarged over time. The patient had her first menstruation at 14 years old, with a 28-day cycle consisting of 3 days of menstruation. There was no record of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, or changes in bowel or urinary habits. No significant past medical history was reported, although she was under a regimen of 10 mg amlodipine tablets daily to manage hypertension. Three years prior to the current presentation, she underwent an open myomectomy due to symptomatic fibroids. There was no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus, asthma, cancer, or sickle cell disease. She self-identified as a social drinker and non-smoker. \n\nShe had initially sought help from a different hospital, where an ultrasound examination suggested a condition that led to an offer for a hysterectomy. However, she ended up presenting at our clinic. Her general and neurological examinations were unremarkable, with a pulse rate of 74 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, and a body temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C.

In addition, there was no specific medication, smoking history, or alcohol consumption. The cause of the accident was a methanol-based paint spill on his clothes that ignited; this incident occurred at a plating factory (Fig. 1: day 1). He was transferred to our hospital for emergency treatment. On arrival, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 165/102 mmHg, and pulse rate of 90/minute. His body temperature was 37.3 degrees Celsius. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was E4 V5 M6, and there was no motor or sensory paralysis. Physical examination revealed 25% total-body-surface-area flame injuries (7% partial thickness on the trunk and right hand and 18% full thickness on the right arm, both legs, and chest). There were no problems with hand function. On day 2 after admission, the wounds on his two thighs and right arm were debrided, and Integra dermal regeneration templates (Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA) were applied. On day 9 after admission, the wounds on his right lower leg, right arm, and chest were debrided, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. On day 16 after admission, the Integra silicone sheet was removed, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. Epithelialization had occurred in most parts of the injury; however, the graft failed in the proximal one-third portion of the left thigh, resulting in an ulcer. With topical treatment with a silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing (Aquacel\u00ae Ag BURN: ConvaTec, Princeton, NJ, USA) for 6 days, petroleum gel (PROPETO\u00ae; Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 6 days, a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb, Maruho, Osaka, Japan) for 3 days, and silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh; ALCARE, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 days, the ulcer was covered with healthy granulation tissue (Fig. 1: day 36). Fig. 1 Pre- and intraoperative states of the left thigh. Day 1: the patient\u2019s left thigh with an injury. Day 36: the proximal graft failed, resulting in an ulcer (arrow). Day 37: intraoperative appearance of the skin graft and negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT). The meshed split-thickness skin graft (STSG) was fixed, and NPWT was applied to both the donor and recipient sites Full size image On day 37 after admission, an operation was performed. The ulcer surface was debrided, and an 11/1000-inch (0.28 mm) skin graft was taken from the ipsilateral thigh and meshed, using a 1:1.5 ratio. A slightly larger skin graft was taken, and the excess skin graft was immediately regrafted to the donor site. The regrafted skin was meshed using a 1:1.5 ratio, the same as the recipient site. NPWT (INFOV.A.C.\u2122 Therapy System, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) was then applied to both the donor and recipient sites with a continuous negative pressure of 125 mmHg. A silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh) was inserted between the skin graft and polyurethane foam dressing (V.A.C. GranuFoam Dressing, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) to avoid damage to the skin graft (Fig. 1: day 37). On days 37 and 38 after admission, 1 g of cefazolin was administered intravenously every 8 hours as perioperative prophylaxis. On day 43 after admission, the polyurethane foam dressing was removed from both the donor and recipient sites. Although the regrafted skin at the donor site was taken completely, the skin graft was not found at the recipient site, and the entire area was covered with granulation tissue (Fig. 2: day 43, left). No granulation tissue overgrowth was observed at the donor site. The staples that had held the grafts in place were embedded in the granulation tissue and were removed. On the same day, the wound was cleaned under running tap water, and small islands of epithelialization were visible under the granulation tissue. NPWT was ceased, and topical treatment with a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb) was applied (Fig. 2: day 43, right). Rapid epithelialization of the ulcer was observed as the granulation tissue regressed, and epithelialization of both the donor and recipient sites was almost completed on day 48 after admission (5 days after NPWT cessation) (Fig. 2: day 48). No significant change was observed between pre- and postoperative laboratory findings (). In addition, no significant findings were observed in urinalysis on day 17 (), and no further urinalysis was performed during hospitalization because no specific symptoms appeared.

The patient had a history of alcohol and tobacco use but otherwise no significant medical history. His left forearm was caught between the motor vehicle and the road, and became highly compressed and retracted. The patient was hemodynamically stable with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15, a blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, body temperature of 36.1 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.

Major vascular and visceral injuries were not suspected. Physical examination and radiography showed an open radial shaft fracture with marked swelling of the left forearm . The patient was given 0.5 mL of tetanus toxoid vaccine intramuscularly and administered prophylactic antibiotic using intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g. Compartment pressure was measured in three different areas of the forearm, showing 40 mmHg in the volar component and 30 mmHg in the dorsal forearm compartment. Five hours after the injury, surgery was performed under general anesthesia. First, we made a curvilinear skin incision on the volar aspect of the forearm from the biceps tendon to the palm of the hand for carpal tunnel release . We performed a debridement of the involved muscles; however, we could not perform an internal fixation or immediate reconstruction owing to the risk of advancing the myonecrosis of the forearm muscles. After release of the superficial and deep flexor compartments, pressure in the dorsal compartment decreased. The wound was closed with vessel tape, utilizing the shoelace technique. After the release, the patient was not able to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. At second-look operation (3 days after the initial release), swelling of the left forearm had reduced with no evidence of infection. Therefore, we performed open reduction and internal fixation for the left radius fracture and PL tendon transfer to the FPL tendon. Intraoperatively, the presence of the intact PL tendon was confirmed. The PL tendon was advanced to the FPL tendon, and an interlacing suture was performed thrice. The tendon was transferred with the wrist in 30\u00b0 of dorsiflexion and the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the thumb in 45\u00b0 of flexion. The wrist and thumb were immobilized in a slightly flexed position using a splint for 3 weeks, following which active flexion and extension exercises of the thumb were started. The patient was discharged 32 days after hospital admission in a relatively good state of health. Six weeks after the reconstruction, passive extension exercises of the thumb were started. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had no complaints and had returned to his former job, despite slight residual muscle weakness of the FPL. The patient regained the full range of thumb interphalangeal joint flexion\u2013extension.

The compartment pressures in three different areas of the forearm were recorded, indicating 40 mmHg in the volar compartment and 30 mmHg in the dorsal forearm compartment. \n\nDespite these findings, the clinical course was somewhat atypical for acute compartment syndrome. The patient did not show the classic sign of pain out of proportion to the injury. Additionally, radiographic imaging suggested a possible hematoma, which could have been contributing to the elevated compartment pressures. \n\nFive hours post-injury, the patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia. A curvilinear skin incision was made on the volar aspect of the forearm extending from the biceps tendon to the palm for carpal tunnel release. Debridement of the affected muscles was carried out; however, internal fixation or immediate reconstruction was deemed risky due to the potential progression of myonecrosis in the forearm muscles. After the release of the superficial and deep flexor compartments, the pressure in the dorsal compartment reduced. The surgical wound was then closed with vessel tape using the shoelace technique.\n\nPostoperatively, the patient was unable to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. During the second-look operation three days later, the swelling of the left forearm had significantly decreased with no signs of infection. Therefore, open reduction and internal fixation for the left radius fracture and PL tendon transfer to the FPL tendon were performed. The PL tendon was advanced to the FPL tendon, and an interlacing suture was performed thrice. The wrist and thumb were immobilized in a slightly flexed position using a splint for 3 weeks, after which active flexion and extension exercises of the thumb were initiated. The patient was discharged 32 days post-admission in a satisfactory health condition. \n\nSix weeks post-reconstruction, passive extension exercises of the thumb were initiated. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient had returned to his previous job, reporting only slight residual muscle weakness of the FPL. The patient regained the full range of thumb interphalangeal joint flexion\u2013extension. A 2-year follow-up showed that the patient had regained 88% of pinch strength compared to the unaffected hand, scoring 11.4 on the QuickDASH score.",

She developed lung disease and was started on pembrolizumab. After 3 months, her lung disease progressed, and she was switched to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg for four cycles with concurrent radiotherapy to a dominant lung lesion. Her maintenance nivolumab was halted after 2 months as she required steroids for radiation pneumonitis. She subsequently received anti-PD-1 directed therapy with anti-LAG-3 on a clinical trial, but her disease progressed after two cycles with progressive bilateral pulmonary and pleural based masses, increase in a right pericardial deposit, enlargement of a soft tissue mass adjacent to the spleen and a nodule adjacent to the right kidney with an unchanged lytic lesion within the L3 vertebral body. She received 18 Gy in one fraction of palliative radiation to the L3 spinal lesion 3 days prior to HD IL-2 for pain (day 1). She was then admitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses on days 4 through 7. Treatment was held for colitis and atrial fibrillation. She was administered nivolumab 480 mg on day 19. The patient was subsequently admitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses on days 22 through 25. Therapy was held due to colitis and shortness of breath, with atrial fibrillation after dosing that resolved in a few days per usual after stopping HD IL-2. CT scans on day 53 showed an 8% decrease in target lesions and overall stable disease per RECIST v1.1. The patient elected to receive a second course of nivolumab and HD IL-2 therapy with nivolumab 480 mg given on day 53 followed by standard bolus HD IL-2 on day 58 (7 doses) and day 77 (8 doses), both limited by fatigue. Usual side effects from HD IL-2 included colitis, renal insufficiency, shortness of breath, electrolyte issues, hepatitis, and mucositis all resolving to grade 1 or better at the time of dismissal from the hospital. She received two more doses of nivolumab 480 mg on schedule every 4 weeks with scans on day 73 and day 122 showing disease stability. Two months after her last dose of HD IL-2, she elected to change therapies to chemotherapy due to progressive pain. Scans on day 182, 6 months after the initiation of therapy, showed progression of disease due to growth of nontarget lesions.\n\nPatient 2 is a 56-year-old Caucasian male with NF1 mutated cutaneous melanoma (tumor mutation burden 1.3 mutations/megabase) who originally presented with a left finger stage IIIC melanoma. He was treated with surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Scans showed extensive lymph node disease, and he was started on ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which was discontinued after three cycles due to hypophysitis ultimately requiring thyroid and adrenal hormone replacement. His cancer subsequently progressed, and he was started on a clinical trial of nivolumab with an anti-LAG-3 antibody, but after one cycle had clinical progression with extensive chest wall disease. He was started on palliative radiation to the chest wall mass and received 45 Gy in ten fractions on days 1 through 11. He received 480 mg of nivolumab on day 6. He was admitted for HD IL-2 course 1 cycle 1 and received 11 doses on days 12 through 16. Treatment was held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. He also experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, hyperbilirubinemia, colitis, and recurrent fevers after completion of HD IL-2 dosing, which resolved by discharge. He was admitted for cycle 2 of HD IL-2 and received 10 doses on days 33 through 36. Treatment was held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. Nivolumab 480 mg was administered on day 39. Digital photography on day 72  and CT scans on day 71  showed dramatic improvement of disease in the chest wall and lungs (not irradiated). He had clinical improvement in a left upper arm lesion, which was not in the imaging field. The patient received further nivolumab on day 72 and was admitted for a second course of HD IL-2 on day 77 (10 doses). Treatment was again held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. He was admitted again on day 90 and received nine doses before therapy was held for altered mental status and abdominal pain. Nivolumab was administered on day 108, and subsequent scans on day 127 confirmed response to therapy with further decrease in target lesions. Scans on day 197 showed no evidence of disease. Follow-up scans on day 266, day 350, and day 454 also showed no evidence of disease. He later developed progressive anemia, and subsequent endoscopic evaluation on day 547 showed a bleeding mass in his stomach that was biopsy proven. He elected to enroll into hospice and died on day 566.\n\nPatient 3 is a 55-year-old Caucasian female with BRAF wild type cutaneous melanoma (tumor mutation burden 4 mutations/megabase), aortic stenosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient had excisions of two melanomas 20 years prior, followed by adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, cisplatin, IL-2, and IFNa. She had recurrent melanoma 2 years prior to presentation and received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg for four cycles followed by nivolumab maintenance with no clear benefit. She had talimogene laherparepvec injections, which were poorly tolerated, followed by resection, and an additional four doses of ipilimumab and nivolumab without benefit. The patient subsequently received arginase on a clinical trial with progression followed by a dose of carboplatin and paclitaxel for a progressive malignant pericardial effusion. She received 39 Gy in 13 fractions of palliative radiation to her pelvic disease from day 1 until day 21. She had nivolumab 480 mg on day 19. The patient was admitted for HD IL-2 and received eight doses on days 22 through 25. Dosing was interrupted at dose number 4 due to fevers, rigors, and chest ache during red blood cell transfusion, possibly secondary to transfusion reaction. Therapy was resumed after 8 h and was stopped after her eighth dose due to worsening respiratory status with increased oxygen requirements and respiratory rate. The patient was dismissed 48 h after the last dose of HD IL-2 and symptoms resolved. The patient was readmitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses from day 41 through 44. Therapy was held after dose 9 due to abdominal pain secondary to colitis and worsening respiratory status. The patient received nivolumab 480 mg on day 55. CT scans on day 71 showed decreased tumor burden in bilateral pelvic masses, with the right pelvic mass being the primary radiation site. Formal response assessment for this patient is not possible due to the inclusion of measurable lesions in the radiation field. Further cycles were not given as she fractured her arm while working and subsequently chose to pursue other treatments.",

As a result, she was switched to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg for four cycles with concurrent radiotherapy to a dominant lung lesion. In the process, the patient required steroids for radiation pneumonitis, which led to the discontinuation of her maintenance nivolumab. Despite receiving anti-PD-1 directed therapy with anti-LAG-3 on a clinical trial, her disease progressed. This progression was marked by an increase in bilateral pulmonary and pleural based masses, right pericardial deposit, and enlargement of a soft tissue mass adjacent to the spleen. A nodule adjacent to the right kidney also appeared, along with an unchanged lytic lesion within the L3 vertebral body. A palliative radiation was administered to the L3 spinal lesion for pain relief.\n\nAnother case involved a 56-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with NF1 mutated cutaneous melanoma (tumor mutation burden 1.3 mutations/megabase). The initial presentation was a stage IIIC melanoma on his left finger, which was treated with surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. However, scans revealed extensive lymph node disease, and he was prescribed ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks. This treatment had to be discontinued due to hypophysitis, leading to thyroid and adrenal hormone replacement. The patient's cancer progressed and he was enrolled in a clinical trial of nivolumab with an anti-LAG-3 antibody. Unfortunately, his condition worsened with extensive chest wall disease.

She had a history of melanoma excisions and had received adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, cisplatin, IL-2, and IFNa. The patient had recurrent melanoma and received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg for four cycles. However, this treatment did not yield significant benefits. She then received talimogene laherparepvec injections, which she did not tolerate well, followed by resection, and four doses of ipilimumab and nivolumab, again without benefit. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, leading to the administration of arginase on a clinical trial and a dose of carboplatin and paclitaxel for a progressive malignant pericardial effusion. She received palliative radiation to her pelvic disease and nivolumab 480 mg. HD IL-2 was administered, but dosing was interrupted due to fevers, rigors, and chest ache.

She had a chief complaint of occipital headache which was associated with dizziness and projectile vomiting for over a year. She had no history of chronic illness. She had three children, and all childbirths were done by cesarean section. She had no previous history of blood transfusion. She had no history of malignancy or cancer within her family. She worked as a nurse. She was married. She denied a history of use of tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs. All vitals were within normal limits. Physical examination was essentially normal. Neurological findings showed that all cranial nerves were within normal limits, and there was no motor or sensory deficit, but she had poor coordination of movement. Basic laboratory investigations were done and included: complete blood count (WBC-4.92\u2009\u00d7\u200910^3/uL, Hb-12.3 g/dl and platelet-165.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910^3/uL), urea (5.5 mmol/L), serum creatinine (85.19 micromol/L), alanine aminotransferase (23.1 IU/L), Aspartate aminotransferase (30.1 IU/L), total bilirubin (0.19 mg/dl), and albumin (38.45 g/L) essentially normal with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test. Brain MRI was conducted  and showed a left posterior fossa mass, which had an iso-hypointense appearance on T1-weighted images, an inhomogeneously enhanced appearance on T1-weighted contrast images and iso-hyperintensity on T2-weighted images .\n\nA ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedure was conducted before surgery to overcome hydrocephalus. Craniotomy for the posterior fossa tumor was done . The patient was placed in prone position with her head supported on the Mayfield head holder. A posterior midline suboccipital approach was used. Through the displaced left cerebellar, a grayish solid mass, with an undefined border, was identified and dissected carefully with cauterization of the feeder vessels. Subtotal tumor resection (STR) was done, and hemostasis was achieved. Dura closure was achieved with a dura patch, and the bone flap was returned. Wound closure was done in layers. A histopathology sample from the mass was obtained. The postsurgery phase was uneventful. Histopathology revealed cells with minimal cytoplasm and dense basophilic nuclei present in diffuse sheets (Figs. 3 and 4). Reticulin staining was not done because it was not available. Immunohistochemical analysis and molecular subgroup were also not performed because they were not available.\n\nWe did not carry out CSF analysis to investigate the leptomeningeal spread of the tumor due to concerns about transtentorial herniation. We conducted MRI of the brain and spine at 1 month after surgery , which revealed a residual posterior fossa tumor without leptomeningeal spread. We stratified the tumor as high risk, and the staging was modified to Chang stage M0. \n\nShe was simulated by using CT\u2013Simulator in supine position. The headrest and a thermoplastic head and neck mask were used to restrain the head. Contouring was done for the target and the organs at risk. Laterally parallel opposed fields with photon energy of 6 MV were used to treat the brain , and two direct posterior adjacent fields were used to treat the spinal cord . Collimator rotation was used to match the cranial and spinal fields, and a feathering maneuver was used in the two adjusted spine fields to avoid hotspots. The radiotherapy technique was 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) using a linear accelerator (LINAC). The patient underwent two phases of treatment. The first phase was craniospinal radiation therapy (CSRT) whereby 36 Gy in 20 fractions was delivered, and the second phase was the posterior cranial fossa boost, whereby a boost dose of 18 Gy in 10 fractions was delivered. A weekly dose of 2 mg vincristine was administered intravenously with radiation therapy. \n\nUpon completion of radiotherapy, she was put on a monthly course of adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy (etoposide 50 mg/m^2 D1\u2013D4 and cisplatin 20 mg/m^2 D1\u2013D4) for a total of six cycles from June to September 2021. \n\nPost-treatment brain MRI showed a significant decrease in the posterior fossa tumor .",
    "rewritten_case": "A 51-year-old woman of African descent came to our neurology department with the primary complaint of occipital headaches, dizziness, and episodes of projectile vomiting that had been persisting for over a year. She had no significant past medical history or family history of malignancies. She was a non-smoker, non-drinker, and had no history of drug use. She had three children, all of whom were delivered via cesarean section, and she had no history of blood transfusions. She worked as a nurse and was married.\n\nOn physical examination, all vital signs were within the normal range. Neurological examination revealed normal cranial nerve function and no motor or sensory deficits. However, she exhibited poor coordination and exhibited a noticeable nystagmus - a condition characterized by involuntary eye movement. In light of these findings, we ordered a comprehensive set of laboratory tests: complete blood count (CBC), urea, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, and albumin - all of which returned with normal values. The patient tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nDue to the nystagmus and headaches, we ordered a brain MRI. The imaging revealed a left posterior fossa mass showing iso-hypointense appearance on T1-weighted images, inhomogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted contrast images, and iso-hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. \n\nThe patient underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedure to alleviate the hydrocephalus before we proceeded with the posterior fossa tumor craniotomy. The tumor was partially removed, and a sample was sent for histopathological analysis. The postoperative period was uneventful. \n\nDue to the patient's nystagmus and the location of the tumor, we initially considered the possibility of a vestibular schwannoma or other benign brain tumor known to cause nystagmus. However, the histopathology revealed cells with little cytoplasm and dense basophilic nuclei, indicative of a medulloblastoma, classic type, WHO CNS grade 4. \n\nDespite the initial misdiagnosis, the patient's treatment plan was not significantly affected. She underwent craniospinal radiation therapy (CSRT) and a posterior cranial fossa boost, in conjunction with a weekly dose of vincristine. This was followed by six cycles of adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin). \n\nA follow-up MRI scan revealed a significant reduction in the size of the posterior fossa tumor, indicating a positive response to the treatment.

    "original_case": "A 65-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital with a 12-hour history of diffuse colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain had arisen suddenly and presented a gross localization to the upper quadrants. He had failed to pass feces and gas for the last 2 days and reported no significant abdominal symptoms before the event except for mild stypsis. His past medical history included a previous thoracoscopic mitral valve repair and mild renal insufficiency secondary to ectopic hypoplastic left kidney located in the pelvis. He had no history of previous abdominal surgery. Upon physical examination, we found significant abdominal distension, severe spontaneous pain in the upper abdomen without guarding or positive Blumberg sign, and tympany on percussion. The body temperature was 37 \u00b0C, and all vital parameters were normal. Digital rectal examination revealed empty ampulla with normal fecal residues. A nasogastric tube was positioned, and about 400 ml of biliary effluent was drained.\n\nBlood tests revealed neutrophilia (leukocytes 9.98 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl; neutrophils 9.08 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 65 mg/L). Abdominal X-ray, in turn, showed diffuse abdominal distension of both small and large bowel with multiple air\u2013fluid levels. The small bowel presented valvulae conniventes without mucosal thickening, while the large bowel showed coprostasis and regular haustration. Cecum diameter measured about 6 cm .\n\nFig. 1\nAbdominal X-ray\nFull size image\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was thus performed showing an anatomical abnormality of the colon and diffuse dilation of both the small bowel and colon. The sigmoid colon was elongated and formed a distended loop in the subhepatic recess above the right flexure. Cecum and ascending colon were in their normal position, while the left ectopic kidney was found on the left side of the pelvis. Pancreas, duodenum, right kidney, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric artery had no significant abnormalities .\n\nFig. 2\nCoronal view of abdominal Computed tomography scan (from anterior to posterior): (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery\nFull size image\nImportantly, the lack of left kidney bulk in the left flank altered the course of the colonic portions corresponding to the splenic flexure and descending segment. The splenic flexure was twisted counterclockwise on the frontal plane, causing the descending colon to be more medial and posterior. The latter therefore crossed posteriorly to the body of pancreas near the L2 vertebral body and descended anteriorly to the psoas muscle. From there onward, the course of the sigmoid colon could be divided into four segments. The first segment began in the left iliac fossa, turning right and crossing the midline at the level of the L5\u2013S1 intervertebral disc near the upper pole of the left ectopic kidney. The second segment turned sharply upward directed to the subhepatic recess running anterior to the inferior vena cava and crossing the right common iliac artery anteriorly and the ileocolic vessels and proximal transverse colon posteriorly. The third segment formed a dilated loop in contact with the gallbladder and the lower aspect of the right hepatic lobe. The fourth segment continued in an inferior direction running along the right side of the inferior vena cava, crossing the right side of the promontory, and terminating in the rectum. Since the third part was dilated to 5 cm in diameter and the second and fourth parts were compressed, the sigmoid colon appeared to be involved in a closed-loop occlusion. A C-shaped fluid-filled loop of ileum with beak-like proximal and distal narrowing was found near the fourth part of sigmoid colon, resembling a closed-loop small bowel obstruction. Both the ileal loop and the sigmoid colon appeared to be incarcerated in a narrow space behind the ileocolic vessels.\n\nThe inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was also characterized by an abnormal course. This originated from the aorta 2.5 cm above the aortic bifurcation and ran rightward, giving rise to a long recurrent left colic artery and some directed upward sigmoid branches. It then turned downward into the pelvis as the superior hemorrhoidal artery. The left colic artery had an extremely long course: it originated from the IMA via a common trunk with the first sigmoid artery to the right side of the aorta and crossed it running left and upward. The left renal artery originated on the anterior face of the aortic bifurcation and flowed downward to the ectopic kidney located on the left in the small pelvis .\n\nFig. 3\nSchematic drawing of the anatomical abnormalities. (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery; (12) first sigmoid artery; (13) inferior vena cava; (14) aorta; (15) ectopic left kidney\nFull size image\nGiven the complex anatomy, we opted for exploratory laparoscopy, which revealed a recess on the right posterior peritoneum traversed by the sigmoid colon. An ileal loop was trapped within this space, resulting in an internal hernia with upstream bowel dilation. This recess was limited anteriorly by Toldt\u2019s fascia, the ascending colon and adhesions spanning between the ascending colon and the abdominal wall. These adhesions were similar to the Ladd\u2019s bands described in malrotations. The ileal loop was extracted from the recess and did not appear ischemic, with deflation ensuing shortly after this procedure. The sigmoid colon was then extracted, revealing thick adhesions between the sigmoid colon and the posterior abdominal wall forcing the sigmoid colon to recoil inside the recess once traction from laparoscopic clamp was eased. Given the inability to safely lyse these adhesions, we decided to convert to open surgery. The adhesions of the sigmoid colon and its mesosigmoid with the retroperitoneum were partially lysed, allowing the sigmoid colon to remain in natural position without tension. Thereafter, a suture of the hernial breach was performed between the lower edge of Toldt\u2019s fascia and the retroperitoneum. We did not perform complete lysis of sigmoid colon adhesions as this would have led to the complete mobilization of a dolichosigma with significant risk of volvulus. The procedure was completed with appendicectomy and positioning of abdominal drainage in the pelvis .\n\nFig. 4\nIntraoperative images:\na ileal loop and sigmoid colon in the hernia breach.\nb Ileal loop was extracted from the hernia breach, and the sigmoid colon was carefully extracted.\nc Complete extraction of sigmoid colon shows fixation with the retroperitoneum (1) sigmoid colon; (2) incarcerated ileal loop; (3) adhesions between ascending colon and abdominal wall; (4) ascending colon; (5) adhesions between sigmoid colon and right peritoneum; (6) hernial breach.\nS cranial, I caudal, L left, R right\nFull size image",

He had not been able to pass stools or gas for the previous 2 days and reported no significant previous abdominal symptoms, apart from mild constipation. His medical history included a thoracoscopic mitral valve repair and mild renal insufficiency, secondary to a hypoplastic left kidney, located ectopically in the pelvis. He had no history of abdominal surgery.\n\nOn examination, significant abdominal distension was noted, along with severe spontaneous pain in the upper abdomen. There was no guarding or positive Blumberg's sign, and a tympanic note was heard on percussion. His body temperature was normal at 37 \u00b0C, and all other vital signs were stable. A digital rectal examination revealed an empty rectal vault with normal fecal residues. A nasogastric tube was inserted, draining around 400 ml of bilious fluid.\n\nBlood tests showed neutrophilia (leukocytes 9.98 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl; neutrophils 9.08 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 65 mg/L), suggesting an inflammatory process. The abdominal X-ray revealed diffuse abdominal distension of both the small and large bowel, with multiple air-fluid levels. The small bowel had visible valvulae conniventes without mucosal thickening, while the large bowel showed fecal impaction and regular haustration. The diameter of the cecum was about 6 cm.\n\nAn abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, showing an anatomical abnormality of the colon and diffuse dilation of both the small bowel and colon. The sigmoid colon was elongated and formed a distended loop in the subhepatic recess above the right flexure. The cecum and ascending colon were in their normal position, while the left ectopic kidney was located on the left side of the pelvis. The pancreas, duodenum, right kidney, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric artery showed no significant abnormalities.\n\nDespite these findings, the clinical picture was suggestive of an unspecified cause of complete intestinal obstruction rather than specific anatomical abnormalities. The sudden onset of symptoms, abdominal distension, cessation of bowel movements, and drainage of bilious fluid via the nasogaic tube were consistent with a complete bowel obstruction. The lack of past abdominal surgery slightly favored a non-adhesive etiology, but the exact cause remained elusive. The CT findings of diffuse dilation of both the small and large bowel did not specifically point towards a closed-loop obstruction, contributing to the uncertainty. The possibility of an internal hernia or volvulus due to anatomical abnormalities could not be entirely ruled out but was considered less likely given the nonspecific presentation and imaging findings. \n\nThe patient was prepared for exploratory laparoscopy to elucidate the cause of obstruction, with a preoperative diagnosis of a complete intestinal obstruction of unspecified etiology. The surgical team was aware of the possibility of encountering unexpected anatomical variations or previously undiagnosed conditions that might have led to the patient's presentation.",

There was maternal history of normal healthy live birth in the first pregnancy and spontaneous miscarriages in second and fourth pregnancies in early trimesters. The fourth pregnancy was associated with Down syndrome. The mother was given antenatal progesterone for excess bleeding in the first trimester. From 2 weeks of age, she presented with lethargy, sweating, and breathlessness on feeding. Later on, she presented with recurrent episodes of aspirations with severe lower respiratory infections. Cardiac examination revealed a holosystolic murmur suggestive of ventricular septal defect (VSD). Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with features suggestive of pneumonia . Echocardiography (ECHO) showed moderate VSD (6\u20137 cm subaortic perimembranous VSD), dilated left atrium and left ventricle, trivial aortic regurgitation with aortic cusp collapse, dilated pulmonary artery system with flow acceleration across pulmonary valve, and half-systemic pulmonary artery pressure with normal left ventricular systolic function . There was no pericardial effusion or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. She was managed medically with decongestive medications and antibiotics for lower respiratory infections. She was noted to have laryngomalacia. At 3 months of age, decreased motor movements were noted. She was gaining weight till 5 months of age, after which there was flattening of the growth curve and failure to thrive. At 6 months, she had developmental arrest followed by progressive neuroregression. She also had severe startle response since 8 months of age. Then, she started having generalized recurrent seizures from 9 months onward. The epileptic episodes were mostly focal with secondary generalization, with the most severe event reported as having frequency of ten seizure episodes within 2 hours time period despite anticonvulsant therapy. She had also macrocephaly with coarse facial features, persistent laryngomalacia, and hyperacusis. There was no muscle atrophy. Central hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, and a positive Babinski reflex were elicited. Organomegaly was absent. Ophthalmological examination showed bilateral macular cherry-red spots and an inability to fixate the eyes. At 12 months, she developed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as reactive airway disease. Gastrostomy tube feeding was also commenced. She had frequent episodes of hospitalizations due to repeated aspiration pneumonia, reactive airway diseases, and other central nervous system complications.

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Japanese man with a chief complaint of hoarseness visited the Otolaryngology Department at our hospital. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a tumor, with its major axis measuring approximately 40 mm in the left upper lobe of the lung. The hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were also swollen . Primary lung cancer was suspected, and the patient was directed to the Department of Respiratory Medicine on the same day that he was admitted to the Otolaryngology Department. He was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by bronchoscopy. We performed transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) for the primary lesion in the left upper lobe and endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the mediastinal lymph nodes 1 week after the first visit. Genetic mutation testing was not performed because the sample was insufficient. Subsequently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) was performed, and abnormal accumulation was observed in the longitudinal hilar lymph nodes (#4L, #5, #10L), vertebral body, and left pleura. The results of the 18F-FDG PET/CT and other findings led to the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma [cT2bN2M1c (PUL, OSS); stage IVB]. We recommended rebiopsy considering the possibility of a genetic mutation, but the patient refused the examination because of strong coughing during the first bronchoscopy and progressive symptoms of hoarseness. The patient strongly desired an early treatment, so we initiated first-line therapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) 3 weeks after the first visit. However, the patient developed grade 2 renal dysfunction [creatinine, 1.83 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 31.23 mL/min/1.73 m2], making it difficult to continue the therapy . We informed the patient about the need for a second bronchoscopy for consideration of further treatment and obtained his consent. Bronchoscopy was performed again, and the patient was diagnosed with ALK-positive NSCLC (immunohistochemistry, 3+; fluorescence in situ hybridization, 56%). In addition, progressive disease was noted . Development of progressive disease required approximately 9 months, and cisplatin and pemetrexed were administered over four cycles, after which pemetrexed alone was administered over five cycles. Thereafter, second-line therapy with alectinib (300 mg/day) was initiated. Three months after starting alectinib, chest CT showed that the primary lesion had shrunk, and we judged it to be a partial response, but the ground-glass opacities and infiltration continued to spread on both sides (Figs. 1d, 2). At this time, the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion, and his saturation of percutaneous oxygen was approximately 82% in room air. Blood gas analysis showed that the partial pressure of arterial oxygen was 58.2 torr, indicating respiratory failure. A pulmonary function test revealed restrictive ventilatory impairment, with a vital capacity (VC) of 2.11 L and a %VC of 57.1%. A diffuse lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 4.84 mL/min/mmHg and a %DLCO of 22.8% indicated diffusion disorder. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)  and TBLB samples  were obtained at this time. The BALF showed an increased lymphocyte ratio (34.4%), and pathological analysis of the TBLB specimen revealed an organizing pneumonia (OP)/nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) overlapping pattern. On the basis of the chest CT results, we suspected alectinib-induced DILD. However, we also considered respiratory infection or cancerous lymphangiopathy with cancer progression in the differential diagnoses. Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 9300/\u00b5L and a C-reactive protein level of 1.41 mg/dL. The BALF culture results were negative. The BALF was lymphocyte dominant, and no findings suggestive of cancer infiltration were observed in the TBLB specimen. On the basis of these results, we excluded the other conditions evaluated in the differential diagnosis. On the basis of the results of chest CT and bronchoscopic pathology, methylprednisolone was prescribed (1 g/day for 3 days). The patient then received oral prednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day), which was gradually reduced, and he was administered steroids for about 3 months. Third-line therapy with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) (100 mg/m2) was initiated after treatment with steroids. However, 3 months later, obstructive pneumonia associated with an increase in the size of the primary lesion was observed . Moreover, mild renal dysfunction persisted (creatinine, 1.63 mg/dL; eGFR, 35.45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Because of this complication and upon the patient\u2019s request for oral medication, lorlatinib (100 mg/day) was administered as fourth-line therapy. Treatment with antibiotics and lorlatinib reduced the lesion\u2019s shadow, and no recurrence of DILD was observed. Thirty-three months after the start of treatment, stable disease has been maintained, and lorlatinib has been continued (Figs. 1f, 4).",

A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a tumor around 40mm in the left upper lobe of the patient's lung, accompanied by swelling in the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. As a result, we suspected primary lung cancer. The patient was immediately referred to the respiratory medicine department, where he was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma through bronchoscopy. \n\nA week later, we performed a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) on the primary lesion and endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration on the mediastinal lymph nodes. Unfortunately, the sample was inadequate for genetic mutation testing. Subsequently, a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan was conducted, revealing abnormal accumulation in the longitudinal hilar lymph nodes (#4L, #5, #10L), vertebral body, and left pleura. These findings, along with other factors, confirmed the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma [cT2bN2M1c (PUL, OSS); stage IVB]. \n\nDue to the patient's strong coughing during initial bronchoscopy and increasing hoarseness, he declined our recommendation for rebiopsy to confirm potential genetic mutation. The patient was eager to begin treatment, leading us to initiate first-line therapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) three weeks after his first visit. However, the patient developed grade 2 renal dysfunction [creatinine, 1.83 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 31.23 mL/min/1.73 m2], making continuation of the therapy challenging.\n\nA second bronchoscopy was performed to consider further treatment options. The patient was then diagnosed with ALK-positive NSCLC (immunohistochemistry, 3+; fluorescence in situ hybridization, 56%), and progressive disease was noted. Despite this, the patient showed unexpected symptoms, including fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite, which were not directly related to his lung cancer. Laboratory tests revealed lower than normal levels of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and growth hormone, suggesting a possible endocrine disorder.\n\nWe suspected drug-induced hypopituitarism due to the patient's symptoms and hormonal test results. However, considering his lung cancer and subsequent treatment, we also thought of alectinib-induced DILD. Detailed lung imaging and bronchoscopic pathology were conducted, supporting the diagnosis of alectinib-induced DILD. \n\nDespite the diagnostic confusion, we initiated third-line therapy with nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) after treating the patient with steroids. However, three months later, we noted obstructive pneumonia related to an increase in the primary lesion's size. The patient also had mild renal dysfunction (creatinine, 1.63 mg/dL; eGFR, 35.45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Upon the patient's request for oral medication, lorlatinib (100 mg/day) was prescribed as a fourth-line therapy. The patient's condition stabilized, and no recurrence of DILD was observed 33 months after starting lorlatinib treatment. \n\nIn conclusion, while initial signs suggested possible drug-induced hypopituitarism, comprehensive examination and long-term observation confirmed the diagnosis of alectinib-induced DILD. This case underscores the importance of carefully considering all possible diagnoses when dealing with complex clinical presentations.",

The patient was administered medication, and symptoms were subsequently relieved. However, 12 days later, he experienced worsened symptoms and was transferred and admitted to the emergency department of the University of Miyazaki Hospital. MRI showed a mass of 70\u2009\u00d7\u200953\u2009\u00d7\u200957 mm in the left temporoparietal lobe (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). A solid element with slight hypointensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images along the dura mater was noted. Cystic changes were likely associated with the sanguineous fluid. A peritumoral band with hyperintensity on T2-weighted image was observed at the periphery of the lesion, suggesting an extra-axial lesion . A dural tail sign was also noted on the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image . The lesion appeared to be focally infiltrative to the brain surface, but no apparent connection to the ventricle was observed (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). Preoperative clinical diagnosis included hemangiopericytoma and ependymoma as differential diagnoses. Left parietotemporal craniotomy was performed. The tumor was an extra-axial mass and had partially infiltrated the dura mater and surface of the brain parenchyma in the left temporal lobe. Small pieces of tumor tissue were removed for intraoperative diagnosis. Under an emergency setting, near-total resection was achieved even if the lesion was in the eloquent area. The patient received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (total dose 54 Gy). However, within 1 year postsurgery, the tumor recurred and a second resection surgery was performed. Four years after the first surgery, the tumor metastasized to the spinal cord and the patient eventually died (total postoperative follow-up period was 4 years and 4 months).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic nodular lesion estimated to be 60 mm in diameter, located in the left parietal lobe of the cerebrum.\n\nThe patient was treated with medication, which led to an alleviation of his symptoms for an unspecified period. However, he later experienced a recurrence of his symptoms, more severe this time. He was subsequently admitted to the emergency department of the University of Miyazaki Hospital. Following another MRI, a mass of 70\u2009\u00d7\u200953\u2009\u00d7\u200957 mm was found in the left temporoparietal lobe. The images showed a solid element with slight hypointensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images along the dura mater. Cystic changes were noted, likely associated with sanguineous fluid. A peritumoral band with hyperintensity on T2-weighted image was observed at the periphery of the lesion, suggesting an extra-axial lesion. A dural tail sign was also noted on the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image. The lesion seemed to have focally infiltrated the brain surface, but no connection to the ventricle was observed.\n\nPreoperative clinical diagnosis considered hemangiopericytoma and ependymoma as differential diagnoses. A left parietotemporal craniotomy was performed and the tumor was found to be an extra-axial mass that had partially infiltrated the dura mater and surface of the brain parenchyma in the left temporal lobe. Small pieces of tumor tissue were removed for intraoperative diagnosis. Despite the lesion being in the eloquent area, near-total resection was achieved in an emergency setting. The patient underwent postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (total dose 54 Gy).\n\nHowever, the tumor reappeared after a period, requiring a second resection surgery. Eventually, the tumor metastasized to the spinal cord, leading to the patient's demise. The total postoperative follow-up period was not specified. The imaging, intraoperative histological, and cytological findings were consistent with a dura-attached supratentorial extra-axial tumor.",

    "original_case": "A 43-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department with generalized itching, hives, and postural dizziness 1 hour after taking slow-release diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium SR) 100 mg tablet for headache. She has a history of migraine, for which she had been taking diclofenac sodium SR. Two months prior to this episode, she had developed itching of her palms after taking a diclofenac sodium SR tablet, which had resolved spontaneously. Apart from one incident of food allergy to northern pilchard, she had no food or drug allergy. She had no history of asthma. At the onset of her symptoms, the patient had taken 4 mg of chlorpheniramine for itching and continued to do household chores. Although the itching subsided after about 15 minutes, she felt lightheaded and weak on standing, which prompted her to lie down. Her postural symptoms resolved within 5 minutes of lying down. Over the next 20 minutes, she developed a dry cough with difficulty breathing. Her chest symptoms were relieved after taking two puffs of salbutamol from a metered-dose inhaler prescribed for her daughter. Subsequently, as the itching recurred with hives, she decided to seek medical care. The patient again felt dizzy and lightheaded on getting up and therefore remained supine while traveling to the hospital. On admission to the emergency department, she was conscious and rational, with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and supine blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 99% on room air. Examination revealed skin erythema, cutaneous edema, mild urticaria, and scattered rhonchi in both lungs. The rest of the system examination was normal. She was given intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg and chlorpheniramine 10 mg. Her vital parameters were monitored continuously. Intramuscular (IM) adrenaline and intravenous fluid were withheld because of high blood pressure. As the patient was tachycardic, nebulized adrenaline or salbutamol was not given. Her cutaneous and respiratory symptoms improved with treatment, but pulse rate and blood pressure remained persistently high. Forty minutes later, she felt the need to pass urine and was advised to use a bedpan. However, as the patient insisted on using the washroom, she was asked to sit up on the bed without standing immediately. Her dizziness and lightheadedness recurred within minutes of sitting up, and a dramatic drop in her blood pressure from 198/100 mmHg to 80/60 mmHg was observed. She was put back in the supine position, and her legs were elevated. Intramuscular adrenaline 0.5 mg was administered immediately, and a fluid bolus was given. As the blood pressure remained low (80/62 mmHg), IM adrenaline was repeated twice, 5 minutes apart, until the systolic blood pressure was more than 100 mmHg. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further observation. Her postural symptoms resolved completely after the administration of adrenaline. Her blood pressure fluctuated over the ensuing 24 hours with frequent high readings, and she remained tachycardic. Noteworthily, her blood pressure readings after treatment with adrenaline were not as high as the blood pressure at presentation. There were no hypotensive episodes. All her basic laboratory investigations, including full blood count (FBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and renal function tests were normal. Serum tryptase was not done as the clinical criteria for the diagnosis were met. Two days later, when she was discharged from the hospital, her blood pressure was 165/95 mmHg. On discharge, a diagnosis was made with a probable diagnosis of essential hypertension. She was prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector for emergency use and advised not to take diclofenac sodium or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Upon reviewing 2 weeks later, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed that she had previously undiagnosed hypertension. Interestingly, the highest recorded pretreatment systolic blood pressure (BP) was 170 mmHg, which was lower than her blood pressure on admission. All relevant imaging and hormonal investigations to identify a secondary cause for hypertension were found to be normal. She was commenced on telmisartan 40 mg and amlodipine 2.5 mg in the night and showed a good response to treatment. The timeline of events is summarized in Fig. 1. The cardiovascular observations within the first 6 hours of the hospital admission are depicted in Fig. 2.",

Interestingly, she experienced a similar itching sensation in her palms two months ago, also after taking a diclofenac sodium SR tablet, but the itching ceased without any intervention.

She was previously diagnosed with mild COVID-19 (flu-like symptoms, including anosmia) and underwent self-isolation. However, 3 weeks later, she started experiencing pain in her lower extremities (hyperalgesia), followed by tingling sensation and gradual weakness in all four limbs. Within a few days, she was also unable to urinate and defecate. Her spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed T2 hyperintensities along the cervicothoracic region , suggestive of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). The patient had no significant prior medical history. \n\nFig. 1 A Spine MRI scan before the first admission, showing T2 hyperintensity along the cervicothoracic region, corresponding with LETM; B brain MRI result during the first admission, revealing hyperintensity in T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in the posterior horn of the lateral ventricles; C repeat brain MRI scan obtained during the second admission, exhibiting no new lesion Full size image One day after her naso-oropharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for SARS CoV-2 was negative, the patient was transferred to our hospital. Upon neurological examination, it was found that she had tetraparesis, with more severe weaknesses in her lower extremities, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski\u2019s signs for both legs. She also had hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and proprioceptive disturbance below Thoracal 4 (Th4) level, as well as urinary and fecal retention.

Anti-aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (IgG) was not detected in her serum. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (70 leukocytes/\u03bcl) and normal protein level. SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi, and other viruses were not detected by CSF PCR tests, while Gram and acid-fast bacillus stains also yielded negative results. Brain MRI showed paraventricular hyperintensity on T2 and FLAIR . \n\nThe patient received high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g/day) for 5 days, which was tapered off afterwards. Her motor strength improved remarkably, enabling her to stand up. However, her sensory and autonomic disturbances persisted. After 12 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged to continue treatment in the outpatient clinic. Two days later, the patient was readmitted to our hospital with complaints of persistent high fever (> 38 \u00b0C), nausea, and worsening of her lower limb strength . Blood tests revealed normal levels of leukocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. Meanwhile, routine urinalysis showed the presence of bacteria and nitrites, with positive urine culture for Enterobacter sp. (> 10^5 colony-forming units/mL). The patient was thus diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and treated with intravenous fosfomycin on the basis of bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. \n\nFig. 2 Timeline of clinical course Full size image Nevertheless, her fever persisted even after 3 days of treatment with combinations of intravenous antipyretics and the use of a surface cooling device. On day 3, she tended to be in a somnolent state; we suspected the fever was not only due to the UTI, but might have a central nervous system (CNS)-underlying etiology. The patient was given 250 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone, and her consciousness improved. We performed a second brain MRI scan and found no notable changes compared with the first one . The following day, the patient was once again somnolent, accompanied by tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever, and was transferred to the intensive care unit. We escalated the methylprednisolone dose to 500 mg/day, and the patient quickly regained consciousness. \n\nBetween day 7 and day 14, the patient\u2019s consciousness fluctuated considerably, from obtundation to a fully alert state; she even experienced disorientation and hallucinations (visual and auditory), along with intractable fever.

He had no odynophagia, dyspnea, fever, rash, constitutional symptoms, or other neurological symptoms. His medical history included only an episode of pneumonia 5 years earlier, and he took no regular medications. He worked as a butcher, was a smoker with a history of 50 pack-years, and did not consume alcohol. There were no significant occupational or environmental exposures. He was born in China and migrated to Australia in his mid-30s. There was no family history of neurological diseases. He had received the scheduled age-appropriate vaccinations in China, not including the chickenpox or varicella vaccines. On examination on his presentation, he was afebrile and the rest of his observations were within normal limits (blood pressure 160/80 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 100% on room air). His speech was normal, and voice was not hoarse. Cranial nerves were intact, there was preserved motor and sensory function in all limbs, and he was normoreflexic throughout. Cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. His throat was not inflamed, with no obvious masses, goiter, or neck lymphadenopathy. He was able to swallow a small amount of water on sip testing, but appeared to have to force-swallow, and choked when trying to sip a larger amount. A neurological examination 3 days later showed an absent right gag reflex, leftward uvula deviation, and absence of elevation of right side of palate with phonation (Additional file 1: Video S1). Laboratory results revealed a lymphocyte count of 0.8 \u00d7 10^9/L, and the rest of his complete blood count, inflammatory markers, electrolytes, and liver and renal functions were normal. Urinalysis was unremarkable, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis serologies were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain and cerebral angiogram were normal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a nonspecific oval isointense T1 signal near the right petrous apex measuring 4 \u00d7 7 mm , with no associated T2 signal change or gadolinium enhancement identified. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) reported increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake from brainstem into the right jugular foramen . His gastroscopy was unremarkable. Flexible nasal endoscopy revealed mucus pooling at the right vallecula with right vocal cord paresis. CT chest imaging showed bilateral emphysema and no evidence of lymphadenopathy or malignancy. Over a period of 3 weeks, his dysphonia worsened, and he developed several new signs and symptoms: atrophy of right sternocleidomastoid muscle (day 10 since symptom onset, Fig. 3), leftward tongue deviation (day 16), and right-sided scalp dysesthesia extending from the right occiput to vertex associated with headaches (day 18). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination on day 15 after symptom onset showed a cell count of 63/mm^3 (mononuclear:polynuclear cells, 60:2) with a negative viral and tuberculosis nucleic acid panel. Serum serologies for VZV were performed; the patient was positive for both VZV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) on day 20.

    "rewritten_case": "A Han woman in her late fifties came to our medical department, suffering from a longstanding condition of typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN) that affected the second and third branches of the nerve on the right side of her face. The pain was triggered by physical activities. Despite increasing her intake of carbamazepine to a high dose of 1200 mg daily, her intense pain persisted and the medication also led to severe side effects. \n\nIn the past, she had been diagnosed with TN at a different hospital where she underwent a microvascular decompression (MVD) procedure. Unfortunately, this procedure was not successful in exposing the trigeminal nerve. Further neurological examinations revealed no other abnormalities in the cranial nerve. \n\nUpon detailed imaging using three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D-TOF) magnetic resonance (MR) and three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS), we observed significant neurovascular conflicts (NVCs). These conflicts were due to a persistent trigeminal artery (PTA) and the trigeminal nerve. The PTA originated from the junction of the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and curved up around the inner margin of Meckel\u2019s cave. It eventually terminated into the right superior cerebellar artery (SCA) which was connected to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). \n\nUpon further consultation and a detailed analysis of her skull structure, we determined that the patient had a narrow head. During the surgery, we observed complex NVCs. The SCA, the terminal branch of PTA, was compressing the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve, while the AICA was compressing the trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone (REZ). To achieve complete decompression and release all the constricting vessels, Teflon patches were inserted between the trigeminal nerve and the vessels identified as the cause of the pain.",

Also, shoulder movements were not restricted in the examination; however, the patient expressed pain during movements. Contrast material-enhanced CT demonstrated a soft-tissue mass. The borders of the mass were indistinct, but adjacent fat planes were preserved. The majority of the mass had an attenuation similar to that of the adjacent skeletal muscle; however, scattered microscopic linear fat attenuation was seen centrally throughout the mass. There were no nodular areas of contrast enhancement, no calcification, and no adjacent osseous destruction.

The lesion was a rapidly growing lesion, this time measuring 8 \u00d7 4 cm in size . Physical examination revealed that he also had hemorrhagic crusted plaques and nodules over both eyelids and upper lip, as well as multiple hypo- and hyperpigmented punctate lesions all over his body. Fig. 1 Clinical photograph showing a rapidly growing lesion on dorsum of nose and pigmented macules on sun-exposed regions of the body Full size image Perinatal and early postnatal histories were unremarkable. He had no symptoms before 2 years of age when hyperpigmented spots were first recognized. The parents were first cousins. There was no history of other family members having a similar disorder. There was no known disease in his two siblings, either. The child was regularly immunized. The developmental milestones were normal. Systemic examination, including neurological functions, was essentially normal. Starting at the age of 2 years, the patient had hyperpigmented spots all over his face and arms, more prominent on his forearm, and bilateral widespread hypopigmented areas over the thighs. This abnormal pigmentation progressively worsened on exposure to sunlight, particularly in overexposed areas. With these complaints, the patient received a clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition. When he was 2 years old, a crusted erythematous lesion appeared on the edge of his left eye, as well. Following facial lesion excision, the pathology result was found to be consistent with a tumor. After a year, lesions on one side of his nose and two other parts of his face also were excised and reported again as consistent with a tumor (4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 cm in nasal region, 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 cm in left zygomatic, 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 satellite lesion in maxilla). At the age of 6 years, the patient was admitted to our hospital for a rapidly growing nasal lesion (Figs. 2 and 3). Incisional biopsy was done from the lobulated giant mass that caused narrowing of the right nasal aperture with external pressure. Pathological examination revealed the tumor as being medium to well differentiated. The right submandibular and preauricular metastatic lymph nodes (LN) were noted during the postoperative period. Chemotherapy was started with reduced doses with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil owing to metastatic LN and unresectable primary tumor. Surgical excision could be performed after six cycles of chemotherapy, and the large mass of 9.5 cm in longest diameter was excised from the nose with positive surgical margin. After two more cycles, progressive disease was noted with enlarged submandibular LN and a new lesion on the right eyelid causing blurred vision. Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment was planned with concomitant radiotherapy (66 Gy to the primary nasal mass, 60 Gy to preauricular LN, and 54 Gy to bilateral neck). He received the antibody every 3 weeks for 4 months, and his vision was improved. However, after 4 months, the treatment had to be stopped owing to financial reasons. Control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed improvement in LN, and no new skin lesion was detected. He was followed up without any systemic chemotherapy, but local fluorouracil cream was used for new superficial lesions that appeared on the scalp, tongue, and right auricle.

Invasion of the mass into the nasal passage or ethmoid cells was not detected Full size image After 18 months of follow-up, relapse was observed on a new lesion on his nape. The excised lesion was diagnosed as recurrent tumor. The antibody was planned, but owing to refusal of financial approval of the antibody, another treatment was given for 5 months. Partial response was noted in periorbital lesions, but auricular lesions were stable. The antibody was approved and was given for 15 months. No new lesions or active complaints have been observed in the current situation, and complete remission has been achieved. Owing to the condition\u2019s genetic heterogeneity, WES was performed with Ion Proton next-generation sequencing platform, and the c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation of the gene was detected in the homozygous state. The variant was then validated by Sanger sequencing . This gene was associated with the genetic condition. This homozygous c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation is a mutation not yet reported in the ClinVar database. The parents of the patient were carriers (heterozygous) for the relevant mutation. The novel variant identified in this study has been submitted to ClinVar with the submission ID of SUB11135062. Fig. 4 Sanger sequencing results in the proband\u2019s family.

    "rewritten_case": "A young Turkish male, aged seven, was brought to the Department of Oncology at Hacettepe University due to a recurrent tumor following local excision of a lesion on his nose. The rapidly enlarging lesion was 8 \u00d7 4 cm in size at the time of examination. The physical examination also revealed hemorrhagic crusted plaques and nodules on his upper lip and both eyelids, as well as multiple hypo- and hyperpigmented punctate lesions spread across his body. His perinatal and early postnatal histories were unremarkable. \n\nThe boy had normal developmental milestones and was regularly immunized. There was no history of any similar disorder in the family, and his two siblings were healthy. His parents were first cousins. The systemic examination, including neurological functions, was essentially normal. The child had hyperpigmented spots on his face and arms, more prominently on his forearm, and bilateral widespread hypopigmented areas on his thighs. Over time, these pigmentation abnormalities became progressively worse upon exposure to sunlight, particularly in areas that were overexposed. \n\nDuring his early years, a crusted erythematous lesion also appeared near his left eye. Post excision of the facial lesion, the pathology result was found to be indicative of a tumor. Additionally, lesions on one side of his nose and two other parts of his face were excised and also found to be consistent with a tumor. \n\nOn one of his hospital visits, clinicians noted a rapidly growing nasal lesion. A biopsy from the lobulated giant mass that was causing narrowing of the right nasal aperture due to external pressure revealed a medium to well-differentiated tumor. Metastatic lymph nodes were noted in the right submandibular and preauricular regions during the postoperative period. \n\nThe child underwent reduced doses of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy due to unresectable primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes. After six cycles of chemotherapy, surgical excision of the large 9.5 cm mass from the nose was carried out, though with a positive surgical margin. Following two more cycles, disease progression was noted with enlarged submandibular lymph nodes and a new lesion on the right eyelid causing blurred vision. \n\nThe child received anti-PD-1 antibody treatment concomitantly with radiotherapy. Following four months of antibody treatment every three weeks, his vision improved. Due to financial constraints, the treatment had to be halted. Control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lymph node improvement, and no new skin lesion was detected. The child was followed up without systemic chemotherapy, but fluorouracil cream was used for new superficial lesions that appeared on the scalp, tongue, and right auricle. \n\nLater, a new lesion was observed on the nape of his neck which was diagnosed as a recurrent tumor following excision. Despite initial refusal of financial approval for antibody treatment, the treatment was later approved and administered for several months. No new lesions or active complaints were observed, resulting in complete remission. \n\nGenome sequencing revealed a c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation of a certain gene in the homozygous state which is associated with the genetic condition. This mutation has not yet been reported in the ClinVar database. The parents of the patient were carriers (heterozygous) for the relevant mutation.

    "original_case": "The patient was a Japanese male in his 40s who had previously suffered renal cell carcinoma and undergone left nephrectomy. Smoking and family histories were both negative. He lived alone in a house surrounded by hills. He used the train for transportation, including taking the train station stairs to the second floor to buy the tickets. He was a private driver of a company car. On T + 3 days [T: day patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C)] in 2020, an employee at workplace was diagnosed with an infectious disease, and this was the occasion when our patient came in contact with an infected person. Present medical history The patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C) on day T in 2020, followed by development of dyspnea on day T + 4; on day T + 6, he decided to visit the emergency room of our hospital where he was checked but sent home the same day after receiving a PCR test. On day T + 8, he returned to the same hospital with worsening dyspnea and general malaise. Blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 3500/\u03bcL; lactose, dehydrogenase (LDH) 646 U/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 6.32 mg/dL; ferritin, 2291 ng/mL, and a positive PCR test for the infectious disease. He was admitted to our hospital. Plain chest X-ray on the same day showed extensive frost shadows in the upper and lower lung fields with bilateral peripheral predominance. Chest CT confirmed these findings, showing a broad range of ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening and bilateral peripheral dorsal base predominance . Respiratory function deteriorated rapidly after admission, with the patient requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation on day T + 9. He was transferred to another hospital after considering the potential need for ECMO. On day T + 13, he developed aspiration pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, with further worsening of ventilatory dysfunction, that progressed to bilateral dorsal atelectasis on day T + 14, leading to the initiation of ECMO. He was kept in prone position during the treatment. Following gradual improvement, ECMO was discontinued on day T + 22 as was mechanical ventilation 2 days later. At the last evaluation of the effects of rehabilitation therapy on day T + 29 during the previous hospitalization, the muscle strength was 2 for shoulder abduction, 3 for elbow flexion, 3 for wrist dorsiflexion, 2 for hip flexion, 3 for knee extension, and 3 for ankle dorsiflexion, based on manual muscle testing (MMT). Due to low levels of activities of daily living (ADL), he was transferred back to our hospital on day T + 30 for rehabilitation therapy. Fig. 1 A Plain radiograph of the chest (day T + 8). Note the extensive frost shadows in the upper and lower lung fields with bilateral peripheral predominance. B Computed tomography image of the chest (day T + 8). Note the broad range of ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening and bilateral peripheral dorsal base predominance. T Day patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C). Figure is taken from Kashiwabara et al. [5], with permission Full size image On first admission to our Rehabilitation Department he was given a clinical examination and underwent laboratory tests. These showed a height of 171 cm and body weight of 62 kg; full consciousness; no edema; body temperature, 36.8 \u00b0C; heart rate, 86 beats per minute; blood pressure, 114/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 19 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation (SpO2, 97% (on room air). Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.416, partial pressure CO2 (pCO2) 30.2 mmHg, and partial pressure O2 (pO2) 77.7 mmHg. Further tests included those for total protein (6.8 g/dL), albumin (2.9 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 26 mg/dL), creatinine (Cr; 1.32 mg/dL), creatinine clearance (CrCl; 59 mL/minute) (urine analysis at any time), and urine protein (\u00b1). Chest CT showed resolution of the shadows in the lower lobes bilaterally, with a band of infiltrating shadows remaining at the periphery of the upper lobes bilaterally . MMT showed hip flexion 3/3, knee extension 4/4, knee joint flexion 3/3, foot dorsiflexion 4/4, ankle plantar flexion 4/4, with no muscle weakness in both upper extremities. However, he complained of weakness, such as his cell phone feeling heavy. Cognitive function was normal, and there were no evident clinical abnormalities of the central nervous system, including olfactory or gustatory disturbances, and no neurological abnormalities other than lower limb muscle weakness. While supported, he was able to perform independently basic and orthostatic movements. He experienced a temporary decrease in SpO2 to 94% (room air) during the execution of orthostatic movements. The patient could stand for about 1 minute, although he required upper limb support during the task and was unable to hold the position for a long time (about 10 minutes). He used a walker and was able to walk independently for about 10 meters. He was frustrated and worried about social distancing and restriction of movement introduced during the pandemic. He also complained of compromised motivation during the inactivity. Fig. 2 Computed tomography image of the chest. A Day T + 30. Note the resolution of the shadows in the bilateral lower lobes, with a band of infiltrating shadows remaining at the periphery of the bilateral upper lobes. B Day T + 78. Note the resolution of the band of infiltrating shadows. Figure is taken from Kashiwabara et al. [5], with permission Full size image Clinical progress and rehabilitation therapy While the SpO2 on room air was within the normal range, the patient complained of marked muscle weakness, mainly in the lower part of the body, together with generalized weakness. Based on the medical history and the generalized and symmetrical muscle weakness reported during the previous hospitalization (provisionally diagnosed at that admission as ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) [6]), we first ruled out conditions associated with muscle weakness. Physical therapy was recommended based on the marked muscle weakness, but could not be provided in line with the hospital policy of withholding such therapy from infected patients until 2 weeks after a negative PCR test. During the 2-week quarantine period, no equipment (diagnostic or rehabilitation therapy) was taken into his hospital room. Instead, he was instructed during this 2-week period to exercise while in isolation, following a self-training program that focused on strengthening the muscles of the trunk, both upper and lower limbs, fingers, and expiratory muscles, including, among other exercises, stretching the trunk, exercising the shoulder girdle and neck, and deep breathing. The patient adhered to the program, which was designed to achieve independence in basic movements and gait, as well as to strengthen respiratory muscles. The self-exercise program included exercising three times a day, at 1000, 1300, and 1500 hours, for a total of about 30 minutes, three sets at a time, 6 days a week. The patient was not supervised during this exercise-in-isolation program, but was occasionally monitored by nurses or physical therapists. There was no drop in SpO2 during the exercising. However, the patient was not monitored with video cameras or remote recording while he remained in isolation. The exercise intensity was increased by the physical therapist after the sixth day. Following this program, the patient was able to walk unassisted by day T + 34 without a walker. On day T + 37, he was transferred to the general ward and provided with a new self-training program. The aim of this protocol was to improve walking endurance by strengthening trunk and lower limb muscles, such as standing up, standing on one leg, standing on the toes, and squatting. Although he spent most of the time in the hospital room, the patient was gradually introduced to light exercises, such as walking outside the room and inside the hospital. Despite his low endurance, he was able to stand without upper limb support and also on one leg for 10 seconds bilaterally. The measured walking distance while wearing a face mask was 383 m (). By day T + 39, his body weight had increased to 66.5 kg and spirometry values became normal (). He was able to do four to five squats by day T + 41, but still had difficulty climbing stairs. When 2 weeks had passed since the negative PCR test, according to the hospital rules at that time the patient was allowed to receive individual therapy (respiratory rehabilitation/physical therapy). In compliance with the standard rules, the patient wore a surgical mask and the therapist wore personal protective equipment. On day T + 49, we started the following individualized rehabilitation therapy, including physical and respiratory rehabilitation therapy, in addition to education on independent training, such as (1) range of motion joint exercises, (2) muscle strengthening exercises, (3) gait exercises, (4) stair climbing exercises, (5) endurance training, and (6) self-directed training, through supervised, non-equipment-based exercises. Endurance was still low, and he suffered from shortness of breath after light jogging for a very short distance. He was later able to go up and down the stairs independently without support, and accordingly was discharged on day T + 53. During the period between hospitalization day T + 30 and day T + 53, the patient was provided with a general diet (1900 kcal/day: 65\u201375 g protein, 44\u201361 g fat, 263\u2013311 g carbohydrate, and < 8 g salt), with protein accounting for 15-16% of total calorie intake. At the time of discharge, his body temperature was 36.5 \u00b0C; heart rate, 94 beats per minute; blood pressure, 106/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 14 breaths per minute; SpO2, 98% (on room air).  Results of various motor and respiratory function tests at 1 and 4 months after onset of the infectious disease Full size table On the first post-discharge outpatient visit, he was instructed to continue with the voluntary training program, with a subjective aerobic exercise intensity of \u201ceasy,\u201d resistance exercise intensity of 8\u201312 RM (Repetition Maximum), and with no restrictions on exercise type. He was also instructed to gradually increase the load with the recovery of physical strength. Based on his good general condition and renal function, the patient was encouraged to increase the intensity of exercise and consume a protein-rich diet after discharge, including natto (fermented soybeans) and chicken meat. A chest CT taken on day T + 78 showed resolution of the band of infiltrating shadows . Laboratory tests at this same time point showed total protein of 6.7 g/dL, albumin of 4.0 g/dL, BUN of 18 mg/dL, Cr of 1.36 mg/dL, CrCl of 61 mL/minute, and \u00b1 proteinuria. He returned to work on day T + 88 and continued to show improvement in physical fitness, with a body weight gain to 72 kg (75 kg before the infectious disease). However, hair loss was noted after day T + 100 , together with a transverse nail groove.  shows the changes in various parameters recorded at 1 and 4 months after the onset of the infectious disease (day T). Improvements were noted in respiratory function tests, the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and 6-minute walking test [7], with a decrease in the ECW/TBW ratio from 0.394 (day T + 52) to 0.389 (day T + 120), as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis using the In Body\u00ae (InBody Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) body composition analyzer, suggesting an increase in the number of somatic cells that make up muscles. In fact, the volume of the psoas muscle, as measured by CT, increased from 276 cm3 (day T + 41) to 316 cm3 (day T + 116) (Fig. 4 A, B). Respiratory and motor functions recovered with no complications.

The patient reported having had these symptoms for 1 month. He had visited an otolaryngology clinic in October 2018 with facial nerve palsy with House\u2013Brackmann score (HB) < III. At the clinic, treatment was started with i.v. antibiotics and prednisolone as well as tympanocentesis with insertion of T-tubes. Audiometric analysis revealed combined sensorineural and conductive hearing loss on the right side and conductive hearing loss on the left side . A computed tomography (CT) scan report on his temporal bone described fluid retention on the mastoid on both sides, possibly with osteolysis.

He was the first child of Iranian consanguineous parents. At the age of 9 months, his pediatrician referred him to our outpatient clinic due to abdominal distention and developmental delay. Hypotonia and developmental delay of gross motor skills, expressive language, and social skills were the main concerns. At the time of referral, the child could not sit on his own, raise his head, crawl, or speak. However, he could smile. Other disturbing symptoms were frequent vomiting, failure to thrive, recurrent respiratory infections, irritability, and sleep disturbance.\n\nClinical findings\nPhysical examination revealed global neurodevelopmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, severe hypotonia, difficulty in breathing, and a slightly coarse facial appearance with an open mouth and protruding tongue.\n\nTimeline\nAt the age of 9 months, he suffered from hypotonia and delayed development of gross motor skills, expressive language, and social skills. He could not speak, sit, raise his head, or crawl. At the age of 1 year and 10 months, he was diagnosed based on the results of a genetic study. At the age of 2 years, the patient developed recurrent seizures.\n\nDiagnostic assessment\nBased on the initial manifestation, especially the coarse facial features, we initially suspected mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) or mucolipidosis; however, the results of an enzyme assay ruled MPS out. Ophthalmological examination revealed the presence of cherry-red spots in the macula.

His birth, which was via cesarean section, was uneventful, and the infant had a healthy weight of 3100 g. However, from a relatively early age, he displayed signs of developmental delay and abdominal distension, attracting the concern of his pediatrician who then referred him to our clinic. The child was unable to sit unassisted, raise his head, crawl, or vocalize, although he did exhibit the ability to smile. Further distressing symptoms included recurrent vomiting, a failure to thrive, frequent respiratory infections, irritability, and sleep disturbances.\n\nClinical observations during the physical examination pointed to a global neurodevelopmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, severe hypotonia, breathing difficulties, and a slightly coarse facial appearance, characterized by an open mouth and a protruding tongue.\n\nThe development of recurrent seizures was reported in the patient's case at some point after the initial symptoms were noted. However, the exact timeline remains unspecified.\n\nDiagnostic evaluation, initially guided by the coarse facial features, suggested the possibility of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) or mucolipidosis. However, an enzyme assay effectively ruled out MPS. The patient underwent an ophthalmological examination, which revealed the presence of cherry-red spots in the macula. An enzyme histochemistry of a dried blood spot was conducted to evaluate the acid sphingomyelinase level, which was found to be 11 nmol/L per 24 h, significantly lower than the norm (200\u20132500 nmol/L per 24 h).\n\nGenetic studies were conducted, involving next-generation sequencing of all coding exons and flanking intronic regions of the patient\u2019s DNA.

Despite high tumor PD-L1 expression, the decision was made to initiate combination chemotherapy plus ICI rather than ICI monotherapy due to the patient\u2019s never-smoking status. The patient received two cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab. He tolerated treatment well, with no high-grade toxicities.

Although clear growth was observed, it did not meet the threshold for hyperprogression, which is most commonly defined as at least a doubling of tumor growth rate. Given primary disease progression and the high burden of disease, the clinical team planned to change treatment to docetaxel plus ramucirumab.

Subsequently, maintenance therapy was initiated with pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, which was changed to pembrolizumab monotherapy after one cycle due to serum creatinine elevation and fatigue.

Treatment with topical steroids of medium potency (mometasone furoate 0.1%) and hydrating creams was inefficient.  \nIndividual lesions tended to last for approximately 2 days before regression, but were asymptomatic. There were no bullae or erosions, nor mucosal lesions. Exposure to the sun aggravated the skin eruption.  \nThe patient did not experience musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or any other symptoms. There was no family history of autoimmune or other relevant diseases.  \nPhysical findings  \nOn clinical examination, we found multiple sharply demarcated erythematous plaques on the back, chest, abdomen, and legs, and somewhat less on the arms and hands. There were no lesions on the groin, palmoplantar, or on the scalp (Fig. 1a\u2013c).  \nFig. 1  \nPatient presenting with a skin eruption with acute onset consisting of multiple sharply demarcated erythematous plaques on the back (a), chest, abdomen (b), and legs (c), and somewhat less on the arms and hands.

In the superficial dermis, however, there was a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate consisting of neutrophils, some histiocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. There was remarkable leukocytoclasis. The vascular endothelium was mildly swollen but without any fibrinoid necrosis of the vascular walls.  \nLaboratory data  \nComplete blood count showed white blood cells of 10.80\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L with an increase in neutrophils (8.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L), but a normal red blood cell and platelet count.

Central and peripheral pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed. Preexisting posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) induction was verified. Brilliant Blue G containing dye (ILM-BLUE\u00ae; D.O.R.C., Zuidland, the Netherlands) aided visualization of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and allowed for both ERM and ILM peeling up to the vascular arcades. Peripheral indentation allowed for retinal lesion verification. No breaks were found. BSS intraocular irrigating solution was left in the vitreous chamber. The sclerotomies were self-sealing and no sutures were needed. At the conclusion of the procedure, about 0.2 mg of subconjunctival gentamycin was administered. No gas bubble was instilled, there were no episodes of hypotension during the surgery, and postoperatively the patient did not sleep in the prone position. \n\nThe left eye had a regular postoperative course . On postoperative day 1 the patient was seen by a junior ophthalmologist, and the visual acuity (VA) in the right eye was hand motion. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mmHg. There was a trace afferent pupillary defect by reverse in the right eye.

    "rewritten_case": "A Caucasian man in his late sixties, who had a background of non-pathological myopia, had previously undergone successful surgery for macular pucker with epiretinal membrane (ERM) peeling in one eye. Sometime later, he underwent the same procedure for his other eye, using the same retrobulbar anesthesia. At the time of the operation, his preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the eye being operated on was 0.5 (\u2212 1.25 sphere \u2212 0.75 cylinder at axis 50) while the previously operated eye had a BCVA of 0.75 (\u2212 3.25 sphere \u2212 1.75 cylinder at axis 95). Both eyes were pseudophakic at the time of macular pucker diagnosis. The surgery was performed under monitored anesthesia care with a retrobulbar block using a 25-gauge (G), 38-mm Atkinson needle containing 5 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 2% Xylocaine containing adrenaline (1:200,000) and Bupivacaine 5 mg/ml. The same experienced surgeon handled both operations, using the same anesthesia and drug combination.\n\nThe patient\u2019s medical history showed a myocardial infarction years prior, for which he was being monitored, along with ankylosing spondylitis. His current medications included daily doses of acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg. The patient had no known allergies and a negative social history for smoking, alcohol abuse, recreational drug use, and travel abroad. His family history included a mother who suffered from migraines and died from a heart attack, and a maternal grandfather who had a stroke.

    "original_case": "A 59-year-old German woman with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and cutaneous lupus erythematosus presented at the hospital\u00b4s emergency room 7 days after having been bitten by a wild Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). The patient reported having noticed a squirrel lying motionless on the ground when she took a walk. As soon as she tried to examine the animal, it started biting her, biting digit IV of the right hand and digit II of the left hand. After the wounds had been cleaned and dressed, she was started the same day on antibiotic therapy consisting of cefuroxime 500 mg orally twice a day. Tetanus vaccination status was also checked. On day 6 after the bite, the patient presented at the hospital\u2019s emergency room showing the following symptoms: general malaise, aching head and body, fever, chill, and a swollen right elbow. She did not report having suffered from nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or noise. The clinical examination showed a minor bite on digit IV of the right hand, located near the middle phalanx, slightly reddened, yet without clear inflammatory signs. There was no pain to pressure, no movement restriction, nor any sensory deficit. There were also visible signs of lymphadenitis at the ulnar side of the right elbow. The peripheral sensitivity as well as movement skills and blood flow were intact. At the index finger of the left hand, another minor bite without any local or proximal signs of inflammation was recorded. The physical examination did not reveal anything unusual. The vital parameters were stable, with the exception of a negligible sinus tachycardia. No signs of meningism were found. Laboratory tests showed an increase in the C-reactive protein (CRP) up to 28.6 mg/L (reference < 5 mg/L), but no leukocytosis. The test for procalcitonin (indicating bacterial inflammation) was negative. Sampled cerebrospinal fluid and urine were also negative in standard laboratory tests. X-rays of the thorax and of digit IV of the right hand and a native computed tomography (CT) brain scan did not show any pathological outcomes. Real-time PCR assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A and B were negative. Starting on day 7, the medical treatment also comprised combination therapy with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam, 2 g/1 g) 3 times a day. However, the patient\u2019s condition did not improve and fever rose up to 39.2 \u00b0C and persisted until day 12. Blood culture remained negative, even at 14 days after inoculation. CRP increased up to 185 mg/L on day 12. As a consequence, treatment was intensified by commencing combination antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g/0.5 g) on day 11. Following initiation of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, the CRP fell to 74 mg/L (day 14) and there was a mild persisting leukocytosis (12.14 \u00d7 10^3). In parallel, the wound on the patient\u2019s right hand developed an ulcer-like lesion showing swollen reddened edges and a central incrustation . The lymphadenitis of the right elbow persisted. It was at this stage that a specific infectious disease was suspected as a possible diagnosis for the first time. Following a phone call with the reference laboratory for the suspected infectious disease on day 14, the decision was made to send a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient\u2019s right hand (A-1825/1) to the reference laboratory for microbiological examination. In addition, a serum sample (A-1825/2) was taken for antibody detection (day 14). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide of the suspected pathogen Igpoly, immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM were borderline. Fig. 1 Picture of the right hand of the patient at day 14 after the squirrel bite on the digit IV. After presentation of the ulcerous lesion and the local lymphadenitis of the right elbow in combination with the non-effective antibiotic treatment using three different antibiotics over 2 weeks, the suspicion of a specific infectious disease was expressed. To isolate living bacteria and extract DNA, the wound swab was suspended in 900 \u00b5L double-distilled water, and a 450-\u00b5L of the suspension was centrifuged. The resulting pellet was used for genomic desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A real-time PCR based on specific primers confirmed the presence of the suspected pathogen DNA in the wound swab sample. Subspecies was identified by block PCR targeting the region of difference 1 (RD1) according to protocols described by Broekhuijsen et al. For culture, 50 \u00b5L of the swab suspension was inoculated in 10 mL medium T and streaked onto MTKH, as well as onto chocolate agar plates and Neisseria selective medium plus (both Oxoid Germany GmbH, Wesel, Germany). The liquid medium and the agar plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Bacterial growth typical for the suspected pathogen could be observed on MTKH on day 3 of culture and on the chocolate and Neisseria agar plates on day 4. The patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid did not test positive for the suspected pathogen. Minimal inhibitory concentration testing according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m100/) guidelines for the suspected pathogen demonstrated an in vitro sensitivity to all antibiotics recommended for treatment of the specific infectious disease. The patient\u2019s antibiotic treatment applied until that stage turned out to be inadequate. In a sequencing study (MiSeq sequencer [Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA], see for details) and the phylogenetic analysis (Geneious prime [Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand], Mauve alignment, followed by neighbor-joining clustering, see for details), the DNA from the strain isolated from the patient\u2019s wound swab was shown to belong to a specific biovar and clade . Fig. 2 Phylogenetic relationship of the suspected pathogen in a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient\u2019s right hand (A-1825/1) (red, in bold) to isolates from various regions. Strains belonging to a specific major clade are indicated in blue. For each genome sequence, the year of sampling, the host organism, sampling spot (German federal states), and the known final subclade are given. Host organisms: Be beaver, Br brock, H human, Le Lepus, Sc Sciurus, Wb wild boar. Germany\u2019s federal states: BB Brandenburg, HE Hesse, NI Lower Saxony, NW North Rhine-Westphalia, RP Rhineland-Palatinate. Countries: D Germany, FR France. Asterisk indicates no bacterial isolate, genomic DNA only; for further details, see. The analysis was based on a Mauve alignment for colinear genomes. Genomes were generated by DNA sequencing and mapping of DNA reads to the genome of the suspected pathogen strain LVS (for details, see). For the clustering, the neighbor-joining bootstrap method was used, with the suspected pathogen strain OSU18 as an outgroup.",

The patient had found the squirrel lying motionless during a walk and was bitten on the right hand's fourth digit and the second digit of the left hand as she attempted to examine the animal. Following immediate wound cleaning and dressing, she was started on an antibiotic regime of cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily, and her tetanus vaccination status was confirmed. \n\nSix days post-bite, the patient returned to the emergency room with symptoms of general malaise, fever, chills, body aches, and a swollen right elbow, but without any reports of nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and noise. Upon examination, a minor bite was noted on the right hand's fourth digit near the middle phalanx. The area was slightly reddened but showed no clear signs of inflammation. No pain on pressure, movement restriction, or sensory deficits were observed. Likewise, a minor bite without inflammation was evident on the left hand's index finger. \n\nThe patient's vital signs were stable, except for a minor sinus tachycardia. Her lab results showed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 28.6 mg/L with normal leukocyte counts. Tests for procalcitonin, SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A and B were all negative. X-ray of the thorax, however, showed a subtle infiltrate in the right lower lobe, which raised the suspicion of a pulmonary process. \n\nDespite starting intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam, 2 g/1 g) on day 7 post-bite, her condition did not improve, and her fever persisted until day 12. The CRP climbed to 185 mg/L by day 12 without leukocytosis. Therefore, the antibiotic treatment was escalated to piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g/0.5 g) on day 11. Following this regimen, the CRP fell to 74 mg/L by day 14, and a mild leukocytosis was noted. \n\nConcurrently, the wound on the right hand developed an ulcer-like lesion with swollen reddened edges and a central incrustation, and the right elbow's lymphadenitis continued. At this point, a specific infectious disease was suspected. A wound swab sample from the right hand's fourth digit and a serum sample were sent for further examination. \n\nThe enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed borderline IgG and IgM antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide of the suspected pathogen. Real-time PCR confirmed the presence of the suspected pathogen DNA in the wound swab sample. \n\nThe subtle infiltrate noted on the chest X-ray, along with her persistent fever and malaise, raised suspicion for Pulmonary Tularemia. However, despite the chest X-ray findings, the patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid and blood cultures remained negative for the suspected pathogen. \n\nDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of the suspected pathogen belonging to a specific biovar and clade. Despite these findings, the patient\u2019s antibiotic treatment applied until that stage turned out to be inadequate. The suspected pathogen demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to all recommended antibiotics for treatment of the specific infectious disease. \n\nIn conclusion, the findings were initially suggestive of Pulmonary Tularemia, largely due to the subtle pulmonary infiltrate noted on the chest X-ray, but further testing and clinical progression led to the final diagnosis of Tularemia. This case underscores the importance of considering all clinical, imaging and laboratory findings in reaching an accurate diagnosis.",

Patient A was a 58-year-old Filipina woman; patient B was a 62-year-old Korean woman; and patient C was a 57-year-old Vietnamese woman. Botulinum toxin was administered to treat the blepharospasm, and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) was administered to treat the blepharoptosis. These cases were particularly very intriguing, as we observed in Patients A and B that oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) increased the effects of botulinum toxin and resulted in a greater reduction of blepharospasm. In Patient C, we observed the initial effects of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) after 4 days and reported the preliminary results. Each patient was given the option to complete a survey that assessed the efficacy of botulinum toxin alone and the efficacy of both botulinum toxin and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) in reducing blepharospasm. Furthermore, the survey asked patients about their perceived stress during the past month.

Patient C specified that only a small reduction in blepharospasm took place after 4 days of using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%), yet she decided to continue using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) long-term to potentially experience more noticeable reductions (). She specified that both botulinum toxin treatment by itself and botulinum toxin treatment with oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) were effective with moderate spasm frequency.

    "rewritten_case": "In this report, we present an intriguing series of three cases involving the administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) following botulinum toxin treatment for blepharospasm. The patients were a diverse group, including a Filipina woman aged in her late 50s, a Korean woman in her early 60s, and a Vietnamese woman also in her late 50s. \n\nAll three patients were given the option to complete a survey assessing the efficacy of both the botulinum toxin alone and the combined treatment of botulinum toxin and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) in reducing blepharospasm. The survey also included questions on their perceived stress levels over a recent period using the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire, which indicates low, moderate, or high stress based on scores of 0-13, 14-26, and 27-40, respectively.\n\nPatient A had a medical history that included hypertension and temporomandibular joint disorder. Her ocular history was notable for blepharospasm, upper eyelid ptosis, upper lid dermatochalasis, and dry eye syndrome. She was using a range of medications and treatments, including brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution (0.15%), carvedilol 6.25 mg oral tablet, desvenlafaxine succinate 25 mg oral tablet, lorazepam 0.5 mg oral tablet, losartan potassium 25 mg oral tablet, and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). In addition, silicone punctal plugs had been inserted for her dry eye syndrome. Her visual acuities were 20/20 in both eyes on her most recent follow-up examination. Patient A reported a marked decrease in her blepharospasm following administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). \n\nPatient B had a past ocular history of blepharospasm, blepharoptosis, dry eyes, narrow-angle glaucoma, and cataract. She was using Xiidra ophthalmic solution (Xiidra\u00ae 5%; Novartis, Copenhagen, Denmark) in both eyes twice daily, Lumigan (latanoprost) in both eyes every night, and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) in both eyes every morning. Punctal silicone plugs had also been inserted to treat her dry eye. On her most recent follow-up examination, her visual acuities were 20/80-1 in the right eye and 20/20-3 in the left eye. Patient B reported a decrease in her blepharospasm with the use of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%).\n\nPatient C's past medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus. Her ocular history included blepharospasm, blepharoptosis, chalazion, dry eyes, and lagophthalmos. She was using artificial tears and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). On her most recent follow-up, her visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. She reported only a small reduction in blepharospasm after using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%), but decided to continue its use long-term in hope of more noticeable reductions. \n\nIn summary, the use of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) following botulinum toxin treatment varied in efficacy among the three patients. Further studies into this treatment combination may provide valuable insights into managing blepharospasm.",

The patient\u2019s history was unremarkable, except for mild arterial hypertension well treated with calcium channel blockers and diabetes. There were no hypertensive crises in her anamnesis. One month ago, she complained of dyspnea, fever, and chest pain. Given the presentation during the coronavirus pandemic, a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed  in line with the diagnostic pathway for COVID-19, which incidentally showed a retroperitoneal necrotizing mass. \n\nFig. 1 Computed tomography (CT) scan in pulmonary (A) and mediastinal (B) windows revealing ground-glass opacities related to COVID-19 infection and an incidental retroperitoneal mass (white arrow). \n\nFull size image Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed  and revealed an inhomogeneous, encapsulated, partially and vividly contrast-enhancing tumor, with a diameter of 16 \u00d7 12 cm. It was located in the left retroperitoneal with a close connection to the abdominal aorta, iliopsoas muscle, and upper pole of the left kidney. Thick and tortuous arteries and veins were observed inside and at the periphery of the tumor. There were no metastases or abdominal lymphadenopathy. \n\nFig. 2.

The tumor was completely resected en bloc without the removal of adjacent tissues. During the operation, her blood pressure and heart rate were quite stable. Following removal, it was identified that the tumor exhibited a capsule that was soft and gray-red . Hemorrhage, cystic degeneration, and necrosis were observed inside the tumors. On pathologic examination, tumor cells were oval or polygonal in shape and arranged in nests or trabeculae, containing rich cytoplasm with eosinophilic fine granules. Large nuclei were strongly stained and exhibited round or oval nucleoli. Tumor cells with deformed, large, or multiple nuclei were observed. \n\nFig. 3 Photograph of resected specimen showing gray-red capsulated structure with focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. \n\nFull size image",

The rash started on the face, later progressing to involve the entire body except the palms and soles of the feet. The skin lesions were itchy with obvious peeling. He had significant improvement of the symptoms while using steroid creams, with flares upon cessation. He also presented with a history of recurrent purulent nasal discharge with the first episode being at 4 months of age. Four episodes were reported since the onset of symptoms, which were at least a month apart, all being treated with a course of oral antibiotics. Additionally, he had three episodes of bilateral purulent ear discharge starting at 4 months of age, which were associated with an on and off low-grade fever. Ever since, he had been experiencing multiple episodes of similar symptoms at least once a month. There is a history of death of a male sibling at 8 months of age who had similar symptoms to the index patient. The only sibling who is alive is an 8-year-old female who is healthy with no similar symptoms. Furthermore, there is history of early pregnancy loss at 2 months of gestational age, but the sex of the abortus was not determined. His mother received adequate prenatal care. He was delivered at term via caesarean section owing to abnormal lie with birth weight (BWT) of 3.5 kg with no obvious perinatal insult.

Of these six patients, three were men, with four right eyes affected. The mean age was 46.2 (range 34\u201366) years. All patients were prospectively enrolled as a single group and gave informed consent to the investigators at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital (Institute Review Board [IRB] Ethical Approval No. SI 227/2013). The protocol could be terminated at any time due to loss to follow-up, inability to obtain mucosal tissue, or patient\u2019s request. The inclusion criteria included patients aged > 20 years with total LSCD or total conjunctivalization from any cause. The exclusion criteria included pregnancy, severe infection, keratitis, and eye or buccal mucosal complications. All standard preparations, including surgery, work flow, laboratory tests, environmental controls, materials, chemical materials, records, pharmacological storage, quality/safety checks, and transportation, were managed by Siriraj Hospital and complied with GMP guidelines for medicinal products. All procedures strictly followed the regulations in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 1271 (Human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products;\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=1271\n) and  Title 21 CFR Part 600 (Biological product, current good tissue practice [CGTP];\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=600\n), as well as with additional requirements for manufacturers of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products. Any adverse event, deviation, or intervention would be spontaneously reported to the IRB for review and further actions.\nFeeder cells\n3T3-J2 fibroblasts were used as feeder cells. They were seeded to tissue culture flasks and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium and 10% fetal bovine serum for 7\u201314 days to reach confluence, following which the 3T3-J2 cells were irradiated twice with 34 cGy X-ray each time to inhibit cell division. The irradiated cells (11.9 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/mL) were plated in 2-mL aliquots onto Nunc UpCell 3.5-cm dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or as 4.7-mL aliquots onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes and kept overnight prior to the seeding of mucosal epithelial cells.\nOral mucosal sample collection\nAbout 12\u201314 days before the planned transplant, an oral mucosal tissue sample (0.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 0.3 cm; width \u00d7 length \u00d7 depth) was excised under local anesthesia using disposable blade. The wound was sutured with Dacron 5-0 fiber to stop bleeding. Antibiotic and pain-relief medication were provided for 3 days. The mucosal tissue was soaked in 10% betadine in distilled water (1:8 dilution) for 10 min, then rinsed with 0.5% levofloxacin before being transported in 30 mL FDM (DMEM, 10% FBS, 0.125 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B, 100 IU/mL penicillin G, 100 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin) in a sterilized box to the tissue culture facility. The dissected tissue was exposed to 1000 PU/mL dispase to separate the mucosal epithelial layer from the subcutaneous layer. The epithelial layer was digested with 0.25% trypsin EDTA to segregate epithelial cells. The isolated epithelial cells were seeded onto the irradiated feeder cells at a density of 2\u20133 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells/35-mm dish and maintained in 2\u00a0mL KCM medium with epidermal growth factor at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nfor 12\u201314 days before the transplant. For the colony-forming assay (CFA), the epithelial cells were seeded at 3000\u20135000 cells/60-mm dish; the mucosal epithelial sheets were then examined for quality and safety (Table\n1\n), including by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Samples were submitted for sterility tests including bacterial culture, fungal culture and endotoxin assay at the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital.\n The criteria for the safety test of the epithelial sheet\nFull size table\nTransplantation\nThe mucosal sheet was transferred in a close-system box kept at 20\u00a0\u00b0C to the operating room. The cell sheet was harvested on a ring of PVDF membrane (outer diameter: 25 mm; inner diameter: 15 mm). The transplantation of the cultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheet was performed at 20\u00b0C with the patient under general anesthesia. The first step was the excision of conjunctiva and fibrous tissue on the cornea, namely symblepharon lysis, prior to the actual transplant. Before and after surgery, the subjects received topical antibiotic every 2 hours, and topical corticosteroid 4 times daily. Intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g) was given every 12 hours for 3 days, then oral antibiotic for the next 5 days. Intravenous solumedrol (125 mg) was given every 12 hours for the first day and once daily for 2 days, and oral prednisolone (25 mg) was given twice daily for 2\u20134 weeks. The subjects wore protective contact lenses for 1 year following surgery. The symptoms, clinical findings of inflammation, and the accompanying images were recorded in a dedicated hard disk and graded for severity at the follow-up periods:  2 and 4 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months. The main outcome included corneal epithelial defect (0\u2013100%) and conjunctivalization on the cornea (25\u2013100%) within 1 year (graded from 0\u20135, with 0 = bad and 5 = excellent). The secondary outcome included visual acuity, corneal opacity, corneal vascularization, and complications.

    "rewritten_case": "Patients\nThis report discusses six patients, three of whom presented with a condition related to chemical exposure while the remaining three were diagnosed with a different condition. The group consisted of three males, with four instances of the right eye being affected. The patients' ages varied, with a mean age of 46.2, ranging from 34 to 66 years. The patients were all part of a singular study group, enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital and had given informed consent for the research (Institute Review Board [IRB] Ethical Approval No. SI 227/2013). The study could be curtailed at any point due to loss to follow-up, difficulties in obtaining mucosal tissue, or at the patient\u2019s request. The inclusion criteria comprised of patients aged above 20 years suffering from total LSCD or total conjunctivalization from any cause. The study excluded pregnant patients, those with severe infections, keratitis, and eye or buccal mucosal complications.\n\nFeeder cells and Oral mucosal sample collection\n3T3-J2 fibroblasts were utilized as feeder cells in this research. These cells were seeded to tissue culture flasks and sustained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After reaching confluence, the 3T3-J2 cells were exposed to 34 cGy X-ray, twice, to inhibit cell division. Prior to the seeding of mucosal epithelial cells, the irradiated cells were plated in specific quantities onto specific dishes and kept overnight.\n\nClose to the transplant date, a small oral mucosal tissue sample was extracted under local anesthesia. The wound was then sutured to stop bleeding. Antibiotics and pain relief medication were provided for a short period following the procedure. The mucosal tissue was then soaked, rinsed, and transported to the tissue culture facility. The tissue was then subjected to a series of steps to segregate the epithelial cells. These isolated epithelial cells were then seeded onto the irradiated feeder cells and sustained in a specific medium for a certain period prior to the transplant.\n\nTransplantation and Follow up\nThe transplantation of the cultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheet was performed in the operating room. The cell sheet was harvested on a PVDF membrane and transplanted under general anesthesia. Post-surgery, the subjects received topical antibiotic and corticosteroid treatments. Intravenous ceftriaxone and solumedrol were given followed by oral antibiotics and prednisolone. The subjects wore protective contact lenses for a year following surgery. The symptoms, clinical findings of inflammation, and the accompanying images were recorded and graded for severity at the follow-up periods.

    "original_case": "An Iranian (Asian) pregnant woman aged 32 years old with a primary complaint of preterm uterine contraction and vaginal bleeding presented to the obstetric ward of Yas Hospital (Tehran-Iran, January 2021). She was a multi-para woman (Gravida: 3, Para: 2, Living: 2, Abortion: 0) with a gestational age of 30 weeks. She did not report any prenatal complications and had received corticosteroid therapy 2 days prior to hospital admission. Upon presentation, magnesium sulfate was immediately administered but she was transferred to the operation room for repeat Cesarean section due to progressive cervical dilation. A preterm male newborn with a first-minute Apgar score of 7 and birth weight of 1190 g was born. Physical examination after birth showed a notable frontal bossing, acrocyanosis, and diffuse head, neck, hand, and leg ecchymosis. Anterior and posterior fontanelles were normal. No congenital anomaly or abdominal organomegaly was observed. Peripheral pulses were palpable and heart sounds were normal without any abnormal sounds. His reflexes were normal, but limb movements were hypotonic. Due to an increase in his respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) score from 4 to 7 and signs of respiratory distress (inter- and subcostal retraction, grunting, and decreased breathing sounds), resuscitation measures were initiated. He was then given nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the operation room that was subsequently switched to mechanical ventilation in the NICU. Intratracheal surfactant and intravenous antibiotic therapy were also initiated in the NICU. Under mechanical ventilation with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) setup, his O2 saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate improved to > 94%, 70/35 mmHg, and 160 beats per minute, respectively. On day 3 post-NICU admission, a PICC line (Premicath; 1Fr/28 G; VYGON, \u00c9couen, France; Code 1261.080) was also inserted from the auxiliary vein of the right upper extremity for intravenous therapy, delivery of medications, and parenteral nutrition. A chest X-ray showed that the tip of the PICC line was in the appropriate place in the superior vena cava (SVC) . Mechanical ventilation was discontinued 72 h post-NICU admission because of improved respiratory condition and normal automatic breathing. After extubation, low-flow oxygen therapy was continued and low-volume feeding was initiated based on his tolerance. His weight gain was acceptable and the clinical situation improved, including a gradual increase in the feeding volume and respiratory support. On day 10 post-NICU admission, he suddenly developed hypotonia, apnea, hypoxia, and bradycardia. He was gasping, had hypotension, and there was an absence of peripheral pulses. In the first minutes after the alarm signs, resuscitation was initiated and ventilation support provided, together with administration of inotropic drugs (1\u20133 minutes). Despite the high-frequency setup of the mechanical ventilator, the endotracheal tube was checked for displacement or obstruction due to his persistent critical condition (hypotension and shortness of breath). Pneumothorax and equipment failure were also ruled out. Several medical measures were initiated (approximately at minutes 3\u20134), including nothing by mouth (NPO), high-dose antibiotic therapy, emergency echocardiography, brain ultrasound, arterial and venous blood sampling, blood cell count, and arterial blood gas analysis. Fig. 1 Chest X-ray findings showing the tip of the peripherally inserted central catheter line at appropriate position Full size image Echocardiography was performed over the next 5\u20137 minutes , and the results showed severe pericardial effusion, right atrial collapse, ventricle dysfunction, and tamponade. The ejection fraction value was 40%, and there was no evidence of atrial septal defect (ASD), pleural effusion, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A peripheral venous catheter was inserted, and the PICC was removed at the same time. Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed through subxiphoid cannulation guided by echocardiography and 10 ml of the pericardial fluid was aspirated (over the next 7\u201315 minutes) (Electronic Supplementary Material file 1: Video S1). The aspirated fluid was sent to the laboratory for tests, with the results showing severe acidosis (pH 6.80) and hyperglycemia (). To improve the hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, the patient was hydrated with low glucose solution and bicarbonate was initiated. Respiratory support was continued and antibiotics covering Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria were administered. Brain sonography was also performed, which was normal. The workup sequence is shown in .

O2 saturation increased to 95%, blood pressure elevated, and vital signs remained stable. Analysis of the aspirated pericardial fluid showed a hyperglycemic fluid (). A dramatic improvement in the neonate's clinical responses (after pericardial drainage and PICC removal) was suggestive of PICC displacement, pericardial perforation, and cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography was repeated (\u00d7 3) every 12 hours to ensure no further pericardial effusion was present. On day 40 after birth, the patient was still in the hospital but showed weight gain; he was in good condition without requiring respiratory support.

She was a medical intern at the same hospital in the internal medicine ward, and the episode happened at 3 a.m. at the end of her shifts, while she was sleeping in the doctors\u2019 room. Because other colleges were unaware of her previous medical history, the protocol for unconscious patients was immediately implemented. Vital signs of the patient upon arrival in the emergency room were: blood pressure = 140/70 mmHg; heart rate = 110 bpm; oxygen saturation level = 98% on the right atrial; respiratory rate = 16 and temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C. The patient\u2019s BG level was 25 mg/dl by self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) device. Since the patient was unconscious, she received an intravenous (IV) bolus of 50% dextrose. Laboratory tests were run, including thyroid, kidney and liver function tests; the results are shown in . All tests revealed no abnormalities, despite a low BG level. The insulin level was high with a low C-peptide level. \n\nUptake of the IV bolus of dextrose improved the patient's level of consciousness, but she still had focal neurological symptoms, including hemiparesis and aphasia. Fifteen minutes after the initiation of treatment with serum dextrose, she was responsive to pain and stimulation. She remained in the emergency room for monitoring, and after 1 h all neurological symptoms had disappeared, satisfying Whipple\u2019s triad of hypoglycemia. Thus, a CT scan to rule out vascular events was deferred. After regaining consciousness, the patient mentioned having T1DM since the age of 18 years and receiving regular treatment with insulin and Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH). In this setting, non-beta cell tumors are unlikely to be diagnosed. The patient also claimed experiencing HU for the previous 2 years. She also mentioned at least three episodes of severe hypoglycemic episodes weekly during the last 3 months that may have necessitated the assistance of others. These episodes mostly happened at night. \n\nThe patient claims that she was very active during her work shift and did not have time to eat adequately, but she injected insulin at the usual dose. The injection regimen of the patient consisted of multiple insulin injections day: regular insulin, 10 U before breakfast and dinner, and 6 U before lunch; NPH insulin, 25 U in the morning and 10 U at night). Her dose had been adjusted at her last visit to her endocrinologist 3 months previously, but she has had several severe hypoglycemic attacks during the last 4 weeks. The patient\u2019s lifestyle had also changed in the last 6 months, as she had begun routine gym exercise to manage her insulin needs and glycemic control. \n\nShe was examined by a neurologist in the morning for her focal neurological symptoms, and the examination revealed no deficits. Her medical history was also concerning for hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), and she was recommended to have this condition evaluated as outpatient. To avoid recurrent hypoglycemia, further laboratory tests and a follow-up evaluation with an endocrinologist were recommended, as well a switch from human insulins to analog insulins.",

Her blood glucose (BG) level was measured at a low 25 mg/dl using a self-monitoring blood glucose device. In response to her unconscious state, she was administered a 50% dextrose intravenous bolus. Subsequent lab tests, including thyroid, kidney, and liver function, did not reveal any abnormalities, aside from her low BG level. However, her insulin level was found to be high, accompanied by a low C-peptide level.\n\nThough her consciousness improved following the dextrose administration, she displayed focal neurological symptoms such as hemiparesis and aphasia. However, she began responding to pain and stimulation 15 minutes into the dextrose treatment. Her symptoms resolved within an hour, leading to the fulfillment of Whipple's triad for hypoglycemia. In light of these findings, a CT scan to rule out vascular events was not pursued.\n\nUpon regaining consciousness, the patient shared her history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), diagnosed at 18, and her treatment regimen involving insulin and Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin.

    "original_case": "We present the case of a 90-year-old Japanese man. As per his medical history, the patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was hospitalized in the internal medicine department, had dementia and was admitted to the psychiatric department, and had cerebral contusion and symptomatic epilepsy and was hospitalized for neurosurgery. Before admission, he was able to walk with a walker. He complained of dyspnea at midnight and, therefore, visited a nearby doctor. Acute exacerbation of COPD was suspected, and he was referred to the emergency department of our institution. After admission, he was unable to walk. On the eighth day of hospitalization, he was referred to our orthopedic surgery department for hip pain and was found to have fractures of both hips. X-ray findings showed left femoral neck fracture, left greater trochanteric fracture, and right femoral trochanteric fracture .\n\nFig. 1\nRadiography findings, showing left femoral neck fracture (white arrow), left greater trochanteric fracture (white outline arrow), and right femoral trochanteric fracture (black arrow)\nFull size image\n\nComputed tomography (CT) results showed bone osteosclerosis at the margin of the femoral head indicating that the left femoral neck fracture was an old fracture, while the left greater trochanteric and right trochanteric fractures were fresh fractures .\n\nFig. 2\nComputed tomography (CT) results showing bone osteosclerosis at the margin of the femoral head (white arrow), indicating that the left femoral neck fracture was an old fracture, while the left greater trochanteric fracture (white outline arrow) and right trochanteric fracture (black arrow) were fresh fractures\nFull size image\n\nHe was surgically treated through open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with an intramedullary nail on the right and hemiarthroplasty on the left performed during the same surgical sessions on the 12th day of hospitalization. First, ORIF of the right femur with an intramedullary nail on a traction table was performed. The first surgical operation time was 44 min. Then, the patient was moved from the traction bed to a regular surgical bed, and left hemiarthroplasty was performed for the left femoral neck fracture in supine position. A cementless hemiarthroplasty was carried out through the direct anterior approach . Intraoperative findings showed absence of hematoma in the left hip joint, suggesting an old femoral neck fracture. The second surgical operation time was 1 hour 41 minutes. The preoperative hemoglobin level was 10.5 g/dL, postoperative hemoglobin level was 9.1 g/dL, and intraoperative bleeding was 200 mL; therefore, blood transfusion was not performed. The patient started physical therapy on the first postoperative day. He was able to transfer to a wheelchair and was discharged 41 days after admission. Thirteen months after the operation, he visited our outpatient clinic and X-ray examination revealed no loosening of the left hemiarthroplasty and heterotopic ossification of the left hip joint; bone fusion was observed in the right trochanteric fracture .\n\nFig. 3\nSurgical treatment.

    "rewritten_case": "The patient in this case is a nonagenarian Japanese man, with a medical history that includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, cerebral contusion, and symptomatic epilepsy. Prior to his most recent hospital visit, he had been mobile with the assistance of a walker. He sought medical attention after experiencing dyspnea. His attending doctor suspected an acute exacerbation of COPD and referred him to the emergency department of our institution. \n\nUpon admission, his mobility was significantly reduced. During his stay, he began experiencing hip pain and was subsequently referred to our orthopedic surgery department. An investigation revealed fractures in both of his hips. X-ray findings indicated a left femoral neck fracture, a left greater trochanteric fracture, and a right femoral trochanteric fracture. \n\nFurther examination using computed tomography (CT) highlighted bone osteosclerosis at the margin of the femoral head. This suggested that the left femoral neck fracture was not a recent injury, while the left greater trochanteric and right trochanteric fractures were fresh fractures.\n\nHe was treated surgically via open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with an intramedullary nail on the right side, and a hemiarthroplasty on the left side. The ORIF of the right femur was performed first, followed by the left hemiarthroplasty. Intraoperative findings showed absence of hematoma in the left hip joint, suggesting the femoral neck fracture was older. The preoperative hemoglobin level was 10.5 g/dL, and the postoperative level was 9.1 g/dL. Intraoperative bleeding was measured at 200 mL, and no blood transfusion was necessary. \n\nFollowing the procedure, the patient began physical therapy sessions. He was soon able to transfer to a wheelchair. After some time in recovery, he was discharged from the hospital.

Her vision at presentation was 6/60 (logMAR 1.0) in the right eye and 6/6 (0.0 logMAR) in the left eye. Anterior segment examination revealed pseudophakia in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. The results of the left eye fundus examination were normal. She had a 10-year history of hypertension that was well-controlled on medication; otherwise, she had no clinically relevant family/social history. Given that the macula was involved, a decision was made to perform pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling and endolaser therapy with or without silicone oil (depending upon the finding of rhegmatogenous breaks, either pre-existing or iatrogenic, during surgery). The surgery was performed using the 23-gauge Constellation Vitrectomy System (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA). This gauge was chosen as there was a lack of stock of 25 G and 27 G sets in India at the time of surgery. Infusion was initiated at 7:00 a.m. through valved micro-cannulae. After anterior, core and peripheral vitrectomy, the epicenter of the fibrous bridge causing foveal split was identified and released using the vitreous cutter . The retina was observed by fall in place following this action. Further procedures could be avoided through proper identification of the epicenter of traction, and the use of intraocular gas/silicone oil was avoided. The eye was left with aqueous tamponade and examined the next day. The optical coherence tomography image showed that the retina had fallen back in place and it continued to re-attach over the following week. At 7 days postoperative, vision had improved to 6/12 (0.3 logMAR), and vision has been maintained over 5 years of follow-up. The postoperative B scan  at the 5-year follow-up shows stable traction. Fig. 1 Preoperative state: the condition seen in a (clinical photograph) and c (OCT scan). This was largely relieved with transection of the epicenter of the fibrous band along the supero-temporal arcade (b; clinical photograph, yellow arrow) and d (OCT scan) after vitrectomy. The relief in traction has been stable over a 5-year follow-up, as evidenced by the fundus photograph (e) and OCT scan (f). The arrow points to cleavage in the fibrous band which helped settle the retina.

At the time of her visit, her right eye vision was recorded as 6/60 (logMAR 1.0) while her left eye maintained a clear vision of 6/6 (0.0 logMAR). Her anterior segment examination showed pseudophakia in both eyes. The intraocular pressure of the right eye was 12 mm Hg and 16 mm Hg for the left eye. The left eye fundus examination was normal. She had a history of hypertension, which was under control with medication. Her family and social history were not notable.\n\nThe patient's macula was affected, leading to the decision to conduct a pars plana vitrectomy, membrane peeling, and endolaser therapy with or without silicone oil. The need for silicone oil would be determined by the discovery of rhegmatogenous breaks before or during surgery. The procedure was conducted using a 23-gauge Constellation Vitrectomy System (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA) given the non-availability of 25 G and 27 G sets in the region. \n\nThe procedure started with an infusion through valved micro-cannulae. After anterior, core and peripheral vitrectomy, the epicenter of the fibrous bridge, which was causing the foveal split, was identified and released using the vitreous cutter. This action led to a noticeable fall in the retina's position, which was observed during surgery. The identification of the traction epicenter helped avoid further procedures, and the use of intraocular gas or silicone oil was unnecessary. The eye was then treated with aqueous tamponade. \n\nPostoperative examination revealed the retina had fallen back in place and continued to re-attach. The patient reported improved vision to 6/12 (0.3 logMAR) after the surgery, which has been maintained since. The postoperative B scan shows stable traction. The relief in traction was confirmed by both fundus photography and OCT scan.

A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus arrhythmia, electric axis deviation to the right and a roughly normal ECG . Ischemic heart disease was suspected, and the patient was admitted to our hospital. On admission, his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, heart rate was 116 bpm and respiratory rate was 21 breaths per minute. His body height was 130 cm, body weight was 29 kg and body mass index was 17.16 kg/m\u00b2. The skin of both hands, both elbows, both knees, both ankles and the buttocks had a hemispherical yellow eminence subcutaneous nodules that ranged in size from 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 to 2.0 \u00d7 6.0 cm . The boundary was clear, texture was tough and the surface was free from swelling and ulceration. Physical examination showed normal cardiac and pulmonary auscultation. The laboratory tests showed extremely high levels of blood lipids [triglycerides (TG) 1.89 mmol/l; total cholesterol (TC) 17.98 mmol/l; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 0.83 mmol/l; LDL 14.02 mmol/l] (); N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 601 pg/ml, cardiac troponins T (cTnT) was 11.5 ng/l and C-reactive protein was 1.6 mg/l.\n\nAdditional routine tests showed normal findings for blood, urine, fecal material, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, blood glucose and blood gas tandem mass spectrometry. ECG showed multiple pathological changes, including enlarged left ventricle, aortic sinus tube junction stenosis with mild regurgitation and mild mitral valve regurgitation. Chest computed tomography (CT) angiography showed stenosis in the aortic arch , while CT of both lungs showed was normal. In view of the strong hypercholesterolemia and premature CAD, family cascade screening and genetic analyses were performed for the case and for both affected and unaffected family members, with the aim to detect the pathogenic FH mutations. Blood samples were acquired from the proband and the other seven family members, including the parents and the five older sisters. DNA sequencing of exons showed a C-to-A substitution at nucleotide 126 in exon 2, resulting in a mutation in the gene encoding the LDLR in the proband and in six other family members . A representative sequencing histogram identifying the mutation and the pedigree chart created based on the DNA sequencing results is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nBased on the patient\u2019s medical history, clinical manifestations, blood lipid levels and acute coronary symptoms, we diagnosed the patient with ACS. Based on guidance from the 2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients with Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes and the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Familial Hypercholesterolemia 2017, we initiated the following treatments: (1) aspirin 50 mg taken orally (po), once daily (qd) and clopidogrel 50 mg, po, qd, to prevent thrombosis formation; (2) rosuvastatin 10 mg po, every night (qn) and diet control, to lower blood lipid levels; (3) ezetimibe tablets 10 mg po, qd, to stabilize plaque; (4) isosorbide dinitrate 2.5 mg po, twice daily (bid), to improve myocardial ischemia. Although the patient was taking rosuvastatin 10 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg daily, the level of LDL-C remained high (14.02 mmol/l). Therefore, we initiated double filtration plasma pheresis to reduce the level of LDL-C according the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Familial Hypercholesterolemia 2017. Following this treatment, the child\u2019s LDL-C level dropped to 3.18 mmol/l. CAG showed 80\u201390% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and 99% stenosis of the middle of right coronary artery (RCA), with the culprit identified as the RCA lesion . Coronary bioresorbable stents were chosen as the best treatment considering the age of the patient. However, in our hospital, the normal diameter of the RCA of patients is 2.49\u20132.68 mm and the minimum diameter of the coronary bioresorbable stents is 2.75 mm. Therefore, we adopted the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) strategy .",

The child had also been experiencing chest pain during mild physical activity for the past two months, which raised concerns about possible heart-related issues. \n\nUpon admission, the patient's vital signs were recorded: blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, heart rate was 116 bpm, and respiratory rate was 21 breaths per minute. His body height was 130 cm, body weight was 29 kg, and his body mass index was 17.16 kg/m\u00b2. \n\nA 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was conducted, revealing sinus arrhythmia, deviation of the electric axis to the right, and a fairly normal ECG.

Four hours after birth, the baby was found to have obvious jaundice and transcutaneous bilirubin test reached a level of 17 mg/dl in the sixth hospital of the Baoji area. Then he was immediately sent to the neonatal intensive care unit of our hospital for further evaluation and monitoring, and the transcutaneous bilirubin level was 16.5 mg/dl on admission and first treated with intensive phototherapy for 16 hours. Laboratory results were as follows (23 hours after birth): red blood cell (RBC) 3.3 \u00d7 10^12 cells/L, white blood cell count 15.73 \u00d7 10^9 cells/L, hemoglobin 12.9 g/L, hematocrit 36%, platelet count 223 \u00d7 10^9/L; liver function test showed total bilirubin 13.3 mg/dl, and unconjugated bilirubin 12.6 mg/dl.

Blood tests showed that lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated at 2470 IU/L, alpha fetoprotein level was 42,580 ng/mL, human chorionic gonadotropin level was 19.3 mIU/L, and vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid test results were negative.\n\nCervical and surface ultrasound scanning conducted on postnatal day 0 revealed that the left cervical mass was an internally heterogeneous solid mass measuring 40 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 49 mm, with an abundant blood flow signal. A hyperechoic region was evident and considered to represent calcification. The multiple subcutaneous lesions included some with abundant blood flow and some with little blood flow containing hypoechoic regions. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography conducted on postnatal day 5  revealed that the interior of the mass was severely necrotic. Masses were also present in the lower lobe of the right lung and the thymus and were considered to be metastases. There was no invasion of the cerebral parenchyma. A tumor biopsy was performed from a subcutaneous mass in the inner left thigh on postnatal Day 1. Hematoxylin and eosin staining  revealed a dense proliferation of undifferentiated tumor cells with round nuclei. Sites of hemorrhage and necrosis were present, and numerous mitotic figures and karyorrhexis were apparent. On immunostaining, the tumor cells were negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, CD99, desmin, myogenin, Nkx2.2, PHOX2B, tyrosine hydroxylase. Intranuclear expression of SMARCB1(INI1) was also absent .\n\nFig. 2 Contrast enhancement is evident at the margins of the mass but is lacking at its center, which was necrotic.

    "rewritten_case": "A 40-year-old Japanese woman, expecting her first child, underwent a detailed fetal ultrasound. The ultrasound revealed a left cervical mass and polyhydramnios in the fetus, which had not been detected during the routine fetal screenings. Furthermore, an MRI scan of the fetus was conducted without delay, uncovering a massive solid component located at the base of the tongue adjacent to the airway. Given the potential risk of postnatal airway obstruction or stenosis, the patient was transferred to a high-level children's hospital that also included a department of obstetrics to perform an EXIT procedure.\n\nFig. 1 Nodule formation: Two large nodules formed a continuous mass extending from the base of the tongue to the left buccal region.\n\nThe newborn girl was delivered via a planned cesarean section.

Two days previously, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital for management of ethanol withdrawal and was treated with intravenous fluids but not BNZs. She removed her IV and left the hospital before being formally discharged, but the family brought her to our hospital with a report of paranoia and believing people outside her home were trying to kill her. Her last known ethanol consumption was 4 days prior, and alcohol, BNZs, and barbiturates were not detected in her serum or urine. She reported at least five \u201cheavy pours\u201d of vodka every day, and had consumed this amount for a few years. Examination was significant for tachycardia (127\u2013132 beats per minute), high blood pressure (ranging from 143 to 149/102 to 103 mmHg), and mild tenderness to palpation to bilateral upper abdominal quadrants. She was calm, fully oriented, and with organized thought process, but endorsed paranoia regarding family members being out to get her and hearing voices outside her head talking about her. A medical workup for delirium revealed normal complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel with mildly elevated transaminases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 94 U/L; alanine transaminase (ALT) 72 U/L], and a noncontrast computed tomogram of the brain with mild diffuse volume loss greater than expected for her age. These abnormalities were consistent with her drinking history and not indicative of a separate process. No substances were present in urine or serum toxicology. She was negative for coronavirus (COVID), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis panel. She expressed interest in achieving sobriety from ethanol. She was first given lorazepam 2 mg orally and started on chlordiazepoxide 25 mg twice daily because her pulse and blood pressure remained elevated. Within 2 hours of every chlordiazepoxide dose, she became acutely confused and agitated, reporting visual and auditory hallucinations and stating that there were people on the other side of the door who were coming after her. After two doses of chlordiazepoxide (total of 50 mg, which is equivalent to 2 mg lorazepam), it was discontinued and she was treated with 2 mg of intramuscular lorazepam and a subsequent dose of oral lorazepam 2 mg, which were associated with improvement of her agitation. All BNZs were subsequently held. The next day, the patient was calm, coherent, with organized thought, and no hallucinations or paranoia. She remained that way over an extended observation period of over 10 hours. She was then referred to a substance treatment program where she did not exhibit any psychosis, and did not require additional BNZ medication.

They reported that she was exhibiting signs of paranoia, including the belief that people outside her home were attempting to harm her. This was believed to be linked to ethanol withdrawal; the patient had been treated at another hospital for this condition not long ago. She had been treated with intravenous fluids there but the benzodiazepines protocol was not followed. She left that hospital prematurely, removing her IV before an official discharge.\n\nA review of her drinking habits revealed a pattern of heavy drinking, including at least five generous servings of vodka on a daily basis over several years. Her last known ethanol consumption was some days prior to her presentation at our ED. A thorough examination and medical workup were conducted, focusing on her delirium symptoms. These included tachycardia with heart rates varying between 127 and 132 beats per minute, high blood pressure with readings fluctuating between 143/102 mmHg and 149/103 mmHg, and mild upper abdominal tenderness on both sides.\n\nThe patient was alert and oriented, displaying a coherent thought process, but she exhibited signs of paranoia towards her family and auditory hallucinations. Her blood and urine tests showed no traces of alcohol, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates. In addition, her complete blood count was normal. However, her comprehensive metabolic panel showed slightly elevated transaminases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 94 U/L; alanine transaminase (ALT) 72 U/L]. A noncontrast computed tomogram of her brain revealed mild diffuse volume loss, more than what is typically expected for her age. This finding was consistent with her heavy drinking history. She tested negative for coronavirus (COVID), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis.\n\nUpon expressing her desire to achieve sobriety, she was initially given lorazepam 2 mg orally and started on chlordiazepoxide 25 mg twice daily to manage her elevated pulse and blood pressure. However, shortly after each chlordiazepoxide dose, she became acutely confused and agitated and reported experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations. After a couple of doses of chlordiazepoxide, equivalent to 2 mg lorazepam, this medication was discontinued. Instead, she was treated with 2 mg of intramuscular lorazepam and a subsequent dose of oral lorazepam 2 mg.

    "original_case": "Patient #1  \nThe first patient is a 37-year-old Caucasian man who had been relatively healthy until he presented with severe fatigue and muscle ache that persisted for several months. He visited his primary care doctor, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed a high leukocyte count and the presence of peripheral blasts. When he was sent to an emergency room, his total white blood cell (WBC) count was recorded at 20.5 k/mm3, hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL, and the platelet count was 146 k/mm3. He underwent a bone marrow biopsy that revealed hypercellular marrow. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis was positive for del 11q23 (KMT2A), and rearrangement of 14q32 (IGH). BCR-ABL minor fusion transcript (p190) was detected in a qualitative test, but it was not detected in a quantitative test. The discrepancy was due to a very low level of BCR-ABL fusion in the specimen. Hence the mutation was unlikely a pathogenic driver. Fortunately, there was no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.  \nHis father was a marine, and their family moved to Camp Lejeune in April 1985. The patient was 20 months old when they moved there, and they lived in Tarawa Terrace until 1992. When he grew up, he served in the Marine Corps himself from 2003 to 2008. After discharge, the patient had different jobs, but he had no known occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. The patient and his family were made aware of the water contamination problem at Camp Lejeune when they received a letter from the US Navy in 2012. He never smoked and does not drink alcohol. He developed anxiety after the diagnosis but had no other comorbidities. There is no family history of malignancy to his knowledge. He has one brother, who was in utero when the family moved to Camp Lejeune, and his brother has not been diagnosed with any cancer so far.  \nThe patient was started on the Linker regimen. Following completion of induction chemotherapy (cycle 1A), a bone marrow biopsy was normocellular, with mature tri-lineage hematopoiesis. Repeat next-generation sequencing (NGS) was negative for any genetic mutation, indicating no measurable residual disease (MRD). The patient received cycles 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B of the Linker regimen, and then underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. He tolerated the procedure well.  \n\nPatient #2  \nThe second patient is a Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with multiple different types of cancer. He was first diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma at the age of 68 after presenting with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4.5 ng/mL. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a 1 cm nodule in the left lobe was positive for clinical-stage T2aN0 prostate adenocarcinoma. The Gleason score was 3 + 4, and the tumor involved 10% of the biopsy specimen. He underwent brachytherapy with the implantation of iodine-125 seeds. And, at age 74, he was diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma. A large ascending colon mass was found on a computed tomography (CT) scan during a workup for unexplained anemia. Subsequently, he underwent a right hemicolectomy for a high-grade, poorly differentiated pT4bN0 tumor. After surgery, he received adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy and has remained colon cancer-free per radiographic imaging and endoscopic surveillance. He was also diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 75. A series of CT scans detected a slowly but progressively enlarging mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. When it was brought up as a worrisome finding, the size of the tumor was 10 \u00d7 13 mm. He declined to undergo biopsy due to the high risks of the procedure, opting instead for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This study confirmed the presence of the right upper lobe pulmonary nodule with a measured standardized uptake value (SUV) of 8.8. After an interdisciplinary discussion, the consensus decision was to obliterate the mass with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The patient received a protracted course of 12 fractions of radiation at \u00d7400 cGy per dose, and there has been no evidence of recurrent disease since then.  \nAt the age of 78, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He had intermittent thrombocytopenia for several years, but workup for the lymphoproliferative disease was negative. However, a recent bone marrow biopsy was positive for kappa monotypic B cells, consistent with CLL. Then, the patient developed Evans syndrome with progressive thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. He was initially treated with rituximab plus prednisone. However, without improvement in the cell counts, the treatment was subsequently switched to a single-agent ibrutinib. After the switch of therapy, his blood counts have stabilized.  \nThis patient was stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1962 to 1987 as an enlisted marine. He lived in a trailer park in Camp Johnson, formerly named Camp Knox. He has been an occasional pipe smoker for about 20 years but had no other exposure to toxic chemicals except for the contaminated water supply. He does not drink alcohol. Although an association is less clear, he and his wife had difficulty conceiving additional children for 10 years after the birth of their first child. His other comorbidities include coronary artery disease requiring stent placement, type 2 diabetes, and depression. There is no one else in the family who had cancer as far as he knows.  \n\nPatient #3  \nThe third patient is a 77-year-old Caucasian man who has a history of recurrent nasal papilloma and multiple skin cancers. He developed a severe de novo allergy while living at Camp Lejeune. Since then, he has undergone multiple surgical resections for recurrent inverted nasal papilloma. In addition, he has received nitrous oxide cryotherapy and repeated surgical resections for multiple and recurrent basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Most recently, at the age of 77, he was diagnosed with melanoma of the right supraclavicular chest for which he underwent wide local excision with clear margins.  \nHe lived at Camp Lejeune while serving as an active-duty marine for 2 years from 1967 to 1968. During the first year, he lived in a barrack in the division headquarters, located at Hadnot Point. During his second year, he and his wife moved to a married housing unit in Tarawa Terrace. Following his discharge from the service, he worked in a suture and contact lens manufacturing factory at Johnson & Johnson, but he denied any occupational exposure to chemicals or toxins. He is a never-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed, which was followed by a cholecystectomy. The patient\u2019s diagnosis was discussed with a multidisciplinary tumor board, and chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and gemcitabine was initiated. Nevertheless, after two cycles, the patient\u2019s disease progressed. As previous immunohistochemistry had revealed a high PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell membrane, immunotherapy was initiated. After receiving the first dose of nivolumab (3 mg/kg body weight) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg body weight), the patient presented with mild epigastric pain. The pain was continuous in nature, but was not specifically described as chest pain. He had no symptoms of dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or changes in stool pattern. Furthermore, there were no signs of weight loss or anorexia. However, fatigue was more pronounced during the last week. Aside from the current cancer treatment, the patient was not on any other medication. No recent infections, vaccinations, or new medications were reported in the last few months. Prior to treatment initiation, baseline viral serology showed no history of human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus. In addition, there were no reasons to believe that the patient had any active viral infections. Physical examination revealed no specific cardiovascular abnormalities (no signs of fluid overload or other evidence of cardiac dysfunction). The neurological and overall physical examinations were reassuring. Vital signs were also normal (blood pressure 114/73 mmHg, pulse of 72 beats per minute, and temperature of 36.8 \u00b0C). He was not known to have any relevant medical history, previous cardiac events, or cardiovascular risk factors. However, 18 years ago, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer that was subsequently treated with a nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Three weeks later, a blood sample was taken prior to the second dose of ipilimumab-nivolumab and depicted a normal cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level; however with an elevation of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP level) [214.3 pg/mL; (normal level, < 125 pg/mL)]. The third dose of immunotherapy was withheld owing to asymptomatic troponinemia [43.02 ng/L; (normal level, < 14 ng/L)]. A nasopharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 57% and normal global longitudinal strain (GLS) of \u221218% with normal bull\u2019s eye, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) taken was reassuring . Moreover, creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase\u2013myocardial band (CK-MB) were within normal range, and 72-hour Holter ECG monitoring did not identify any signs of arrhythmia. Fig. 1 Initial electrocardiogram (ECG). Normal sinus rhythm without any irregularities Full size image The flowchart of the European Society of Cardiology, as described by Hu et al., was followed and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which revealed a subtle zone of contrast captation in the inferior segment of the left ventricular wall  [5]. Steroid therapy was initiated, that is, oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day. Troponin levels kept increasing (peak, 176 ng/L) despite steroid introduction ().

Cardiac catheterization revealed no remarkable findings [6]. The dosage of prednisolone was increased to 100 mg daily. Nonetheless, troponin levels kept increasing, and a follow-up fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), performed 28 days after initial onset, depicted multiple zones of active myocardial inflammation: basal septal, mid-anterior, and apical inferior . ICI therapy was permanently discontinued, and the oral dosage of prednisolone was further increased to 2 mg/kg per day. Subsequently, the patient experienced an episode of transient diplopia with vertigo that required hospitalization for further investigations. Brain MRI elucidated both infra- and supratentorial infarction. The MRI report described subacute infarctions in both the left and the right side of the brain (more present in the posterior circulation compared with the anterior). There were no signs of vasogenic edema or inflammation of the blood vessels. The specific pattern on MRI was highly suggestive for emboli of cardiac origin rather than vasculitis or a posterior reversible encephalopathy disorder. However, we could not detect any signs of atrial fibrillation, and TTE was reassuring. Aspirin 80 mg and 14,000 IU of tinzaparin once daily was started subsequently.

The patient underwent an Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, followed by a cholecystectomy. Upon discussing his diagnosis with a multidisciplinary tumor board, he was commenced on a chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin and gemcitabine. Despite two cycles of chemotherapy, his disease progressed.\n\nImmunohistochemistry revealed a high PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell membrane, prompting initiation of immunotherapy. He was administered a dose of nivolumab (3 mg/kg body weight) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg body weight). Subsequently, the patient experienced mild epigastric pain, although the pain was not specifically described as chest pain. He did not report symptoms of dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or changes in stool pattern. Weight loss or anorexia was also absent but there was a noticeable increase in fatigue. \n\nThe patient was not on any other medication apart from the cancer treatment. Record of any recent infections, vaccinations, or new medications were absent. Baseline viral serology prior to treatment initiation indicated no past history of HIV, hepatitis B or C virus. There were no signs of active viral infections as well. A physical examination did not reveal any cardiovascular abnormalities and the neurological examination was normal. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 114/73 mmHg, pulse of 72 beats per minute, and temperature of 36.8 \u00b0C.\n\nBefore the subsequent dose of ipilimumab-nivolumab, a blood sample showed a normal cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level, but an elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP level) [214.3 pg/mL; (normal level, < 125 pg/mL)].

    "original_case": "A 75-year-old Thai man with a recent history of tuberculosis infection presented with an enlarged tonsil. Following an initial physical examination, the otolaryngologist sent the patient for computed tomography (CT) scan of his neck, which revealed that his tonsil was normal but that there was a mass located incidentally at his cervical spine at the level of C1/C2. There was no history of neck pain, gait abnormalities, or neurological problems. Physical examination revealed only increased tendon reflex of his upper and lower extremities. His neck range of motion was full, and his bowel bladder function was normal. Neither paralysis nor paresthesia was observed. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extradural enhancing mass at the right C1/C2 level compressing the spinal cord . Despite the subtle clinical neurological deficit, the MRI finding of severe spinal cord compression was concerning, and treatment options were discussed. Due to the high risk of creating instability following resection of the tumor, the treatment chosen was that of additional fusion of the upper cervical spine. Preoperative plain radiographs of the cervical spine and the upper cervical sagittal alignment are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1 T1-weighted, post-contrast injection magnetic resonance imaging images show an enhancing lesion at an extradural location with an intradural extension at the right side of the C1/C2 vertebrae in the coronal (a), sagittal (b), and axial (c) plane. The mass effect caused corresponding spinal cord compression with left posterolateral displacement. No obvious cord signal abnormality was seen. Plain film radiographs of the preoperative cervical spine in the anteroposterior (d) and lateral view (e) also show the measured angle of occiput-C2 (blue), C1\u2013C2 (red), and Takami\u2019s angle (yellow) of \u2212 23\u00b0, \u2212 27\u00b0, and 104\u00b0, respectively.\n\nA standard posterior midline cervical spine approach was carried out. Since preoperative imaging showed that both C2 and C3 pedicles were feasible enough to insert the pedicular screws, we decided to use the technique to achieve maximal strength and stability of the construct system assisted by the CT navigation system. The pedicle screw insertion at the C2 level was uneventful. However, lateral breeching was encountered during the insertion on the right side at the C3 level. Concerned for the risk of bilateral vertebral artery injuries, we switched to the lateral mass screw technique on the other side of C3. Intraoperative neuromonitoring using motor-evoked potentials and somatosensory-evoked potentials were used and remained unchanged from baseline throughout the surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, and while still in the recovery room, the patient complained of discomfort in his throat, accompanied by difficulty swallowing and opening his mouth. Bedside swallowing evaluation revealed some weakness of the neck muscles and desaturation following swallowing of a small amount of water (3 ml). He could not voluntarily cough sharply. The gag reflex was positive on both sides but delayed. Therefore, the rehabilitation physicians suggested keeping him with a nasogastric tube until further evaluation.\n\nPostoperative radiographic examination illustrated that the screw-rod system was intact and that the atlantoaxial alignment was neutral. CT angiography showed no VA injury with good distal flow. MRI of the brain did not demonstrate any evidence of stroke or suspected cause of dysphagia . Using the McGregor line as a reference of the occipital bone, the occiput-C2 and C1\u2013C2 angles were \u2212 1.8\u00b0 and \u2212 25.1\u00b0, respectively (the minus value indicates that the angle is in lordosis). The craniovertebral angle proposed by Takami et al. to evaluate the craniovertebral fixation angle, namely, the angle between the line parallel to the bony palate and the posterior longitudinal line of vertebrae of C2, was 81.1\u00b0. The space between the posterior border of the mandible and the anterior of the cervical spine was narrowed, as was the distance between the screw-rod fixation system and the occiput . Taken together, these findings led us to believe that the cause of the trismus and dysphagia was the position of the screws. Therefore, an operation to adjust the position of the C1 and C2 screws to be relatively more extended position was performed on the eighth day after the first surgery.\n\nFig. 2 Computer tomography reveals the right C3 pedicular screw trajectory, which involves the medial border of the right foramen transversarium and left C3 lateral mass screw (a). Postoperative computed tomography angiography demonstrated a patent of right vertebral artery and good distal flow (b). Postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging technique did not show any diffusion restriction (c, d).\n\nFig. 3 Plain radiographs after the first operation reveal the neutral alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The occiput-C2 angle is \u2212 1.8\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle is \u2212 25.1\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami is 81.1\u00b0 (c).\n\nComparison of intraoperative fluoroscopic images before and after adjustment of the implant positions revealed that following the adjustment, the alignment of the C1\u2013C2 level was more extended . The space of interest behind the mandible associated with the cervical spine and just beneath the occipital bone associated with the screw-rod system was widened.\n\nFig. 4 Intraoperative fluoroscopic images showing pre-adjustment (a) and post-adjustment (b) status of the screw-rod fixation system. Post-adjustment, the distance between both sides of the C1 and C2 screw head was shortened (as well as the length of both rods), thus creating the C1/C2 alignment in a relatively more lordotic position.\n\nFig. 5 Plain radiographs after the second operation show an extended alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The post-correction occiput-C2 angle was \u2212 13.7\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle was \u2212 32\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami was decreased to 76\u00b0 (c).",

Moreover, he experienced loss of appetite and weight reduction. However, fever, night sweat, and respiratory symptoms were not observed. The patient was a former smoker (20 pack-years) but had no history of drinking. His medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and Basedow\u2019s disease. Moreover, he was taking medications including telmisartan, amlodipine, atorvastatin, sitagliptin, metformin, and thiamazole. Physical examination revealed the following vital signs: temperature, 36.7 \u00b0C; blood pressure, 116/83 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 cycles/minute; and oxygen saturation, 93% on room air. A large solid, nontender mass was palpated in the left anterior chest wall, and skin bruising was observed . The patient had poor oral hygiene due to periodontitis. However, his other physical examination findings were normal.\n\nThe hemogram results were as follows: leukocytosis of 13.1 \u00d7 10^3 cells/\u03bcL with left shift. The blood electrolyte levels and renal and liver function test results were normal. The C-reactive protein level was 178 mg/L. Hemoglobin A1c was 7.0%, and the thyroid function was normal. Blood cultures revealed no growth. Chest radiography revealed consolidation in the left middle lung . Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass-like consolidation in the left upper lobe . Consolidation caused rib erosion, and it extended directly into the anterior chest wall, deep to the pectoralis major muscle. FDG-PET scan showed increased metabolic activity (maximal standardized uptake value [SUV] of 24.6) in the mass . A primary lung tumor invading the chest wall was suspected. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchial washing and transbronchial biopsy, which did not reveal endobronchial abnormalities. After the procedure, the patient developed fever, and prophylactic antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg orally every 8 h for 5 days) was administered. Biopsy using a specimen collected from the lesion in the left upper lobe had unremarkable results. Culture of the bronchial washing sample was sterile. CT scan-guided transthoracic biopsy of the mass was performed. Histologic examination revealed granulomatous tissues. Because the transthoracic biopsy result was considered nondiagnostic, surgical resection was conducted for diagnostic purposes.\n\nSurgical extirpation of the mass with left upper lobe partial resection was performed. Pathological examination revealed the presence of sulfur granules and filamentous, Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria in the inflammatory site . Tissue cultures for bacteria, fungus, and mycobacteria were negative.\n\nFig. 1 Physical examination findings of the chest wall Full size image  \nFig. 2 Chest radiography image upon presentation Full size image  \nFig. 3 Computed tomography scan image of the chest (a) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography image (b) upon presentation Full size image  \nFig. 4 Results of the histopathological examination conducted using a surgical specimen. a Hematoxylin and eosin staining (original magnification, \u00d7100). b Gram staining (original magnification, \u00d7400) Full size image",

In addition, a 5-min suppression and a 5-min resection were performed for the pancreatic cut end margin using a Powered Echelon 60 Green cartridge. Closed drainages were placed in the pancreatic stump and under the left diaphragm. The surgical time and hemorrhage volume were 267 min and 600 ml, respectively. \n\nOn day 1 after surgery, the patient had a serum amylase level of 1303 U/L but high drain amylase levels (drainage of the pancreatic stump: 52,270 U/L, left subphrenic drainage: 6626 U/L). The color tone of the drainage was wine red. \n\nOn day 4 after surgery, his serum amylase level was 134 U/L, and he was diagnosed with pancreatic fistula on the basis of the drain amylase level (drainage of the pancreatic stump: 420 U/L, left subphrenic drainage: 865 U/L). \n\nOn day 7 after surgery, the patient developed a high inflammation level and persistent fever, due to which a contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed .

We injected both fluids at the same time while removing the drain over a period of about 5 seconds to ensure that the entire abscess cavity was covered with fibrin glue. Solution A and the twofold diluted solution B were simultaneously injected, after which the fluid drainage was almost stopped with no fever or abdominal pain at the time.

She was well before the vaccination and did not have any pulmonary involvement on chest radiography or any symptoms suggestive of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. She was known to have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, although neither serological nor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed before and after vaccination. After receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, she experienced muscle pain only at the site of injection. She had a medical history of microhematuria; the normal level of serum creatinine (0.60 mg/dL, reference 0.47\u20130.79 mg/dL) and microhematuria (3+, intense at qualitative score, reference negative) without proteinuria at the medical check-up 2 years ago. In her family history, her grandmother had hematuria (details unknown). Gross hematuria resolved 6 days after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine; however, microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field, reference 1\u20134 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (3+, intense at qualitative score) with normal level of serum creatinine (0.64 mg/dL) were found. She was admitted to our hospital 4 weeks after the second vaccination because of persistent urinary abnormalities. Microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, 0.15 g/g, reference < 0.15 g/g) were found, and the shape of red blood cells in urine was dysmorphic, which indicated glomerular hematuria. The serum creatinine level was normal (0.57 mg/dL). Physical examination results were normal, and her blood pressure was 123/74 mmHg. She was afebrile and had no lymphadenopathy, rash, throat erythema, or lower-extremity edema. At 4 weeks after the second vaccination, urinalysis showed microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, 0.30 g/g). However, the normal range of proteinuria is 0.11 g/day (reference < 0.15 g/day). Laboratory data of serum showed albumin were within normal range (4.6 g/dL, reference 4.0\u20135.0 g/dL), and serum creatinine was also within normal range (0.53 mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was within the normal range (5.4%, reference < 6.2%), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody (HCV-Ab) tests were negative (HBsAg, negative; reference negative; HCV-Ab, negative; reference negative). Serum immunoglobulins were within normal limits (IgG: 1171 mg/dL, reference 880\u20131800 mg/dL, IgA: 246 mg/dL, reference 126\u2013517 mg/dL, IgM: 95 mg/dL, reference 52\u2013270 ng/dL), anti-streptolysin O antibody (ASO) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) were normal (ASO: 40 U/mL, reference < 250 U/mL, ANA: < \u00d740, reference < \u00d740), and complements were also within normal limits (C3: 93 mg/dL, reference 80\u2013140 mg/dL, C4: 21.3 mg/dL, reference 11.0\u201334.0 mg/dL, CH50: 43 U/mL, reference 30\u201345 U/mL). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO-ANCA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic proteinase 3 antibody (PR3-ANCA), and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM-Ab) were negative (MPO-ANCA: < 0.5 IU/mL, reference < 3.5 IU/mL, PR3-ANCA: < 0.5 U/mL, reference < 2.0 U/mL, anti-GBM-Ab: 0.6, reference < 7.0 U/mL). To confirm the diagnosis, a renal biopsy was performed. Renal biopsy specimens (Fig. 1 a\u2013d) included 21 glomeruli, among which one had global sclerosis. In the remaining 20 glomeruli, one with increased cellularity of the mesangial cells and expansion of the mesangial area was observed (Fig. 1 A; periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining). Neither double contours nor spikes in the glomerular capillaries were observed. Segmental sclerosis, crescents, proliferation of endocapillary cells, and capsular adhesions were not observed. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis accounted for approximately 5% of the entire interstitium. Immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 b, c) demonstrated diffuse moderate-to-intense deposits of IgA and C3c in mesangial lesions (Fig. 1 b; IgA staining, Fig. 1 c; C3c staining). IgG, IgM, and fibrinogen levels were extremely weak, and C4 and C1q were negative. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposits in the mesangial and/or paramesangial areas . The Oxford MEST-C score (where M is mesangial hypercellularity, E is endocapillary hypercellularity, S is segmental sclerosis, T is tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis > 25%, and C is an active cellular or fibrocellular crescent) was classified as M0E0S0T0C0.",

Rivaroxaban was earlier started for an initial diagnosis by contrast-enhanced CT. However, her symptoms did not improve after more than 1 year, so she was referred to our department for further examination. The patient had a medication history for depression, was gravida 2 para 2, and had received total hysterectomy for endometriosis. She had no smoking habit and no alcohol intake, no remarkable family medical history, and no exceptional socioeconomic background. Her medication included rivaroxaban 10 mg/day, spironolactone 25 mg/day, lorazepam 0.5 mg/day, eszopiclone 1 mg/day, duloxetine 40 mg/day, bromazepam 3 mg/day, pantothenic acid 300 mg/day, brotizolam 0.25 mg/day, olanzapine 2.5 mg/day, triazolam 0.25 mg/day, and magnesium oxide 750 mg/day. On physical examination, her heart rate was 72 bpm, blood pressure was 130/74 mmHg, body temperature was 36.2 \u00b0C, and SpO2 was 98%. Inspection of the left lower limb revealed swelling and edema with moderate tenderness and mild pain. The right lower limb appeared normal.

Urine findings were pH 6.0, SG 1.004, PRO (\u2212), LEU 1-4/HPF, BLD (\u2212), NIT (\u2212), KET (\u2212), and URO < 2.0 mg/dL. Enhanced computed tomography (e-CT) revealed vein-to-vein collateral formation, and multiple AVF from the common iliac and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac and common femoral veins (Fig. 1 a, c). Her symptoms worsened despite the commencement of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and standard compression therapy at her previous hospital. Angiography confirmed the AVF to run from the common and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac vein , with left external iliac vein flow proximally to distally. Ultrasound findings disclosed high-velocity arterialized waveforms in the external iliac and femoral veins. We first considered surgical repair for the AVF but opted against it due to the number of fistulas and their very complicated morphology. Her symptoms became progressively worse, which necessitated EVT from the common femoral veins for the occluded left iliac vein after repeated discussions among the vascular surgeon, plastic surgeon, and cardiologist. The patient provided sufficient informed consent for treatment before and after the procedure. We administered heparin 5000 units at the start of the procedure and maintained ACT at approximately 300 seconds. The procedure required a high tip load guidewire, such as Halberd\u00ae (ASAHI INTEC, Aichi, Japan) or Chevalier tapered 30\u00ae (NIPRO, Osaka, Japan), due to the very hard occlusion in the lesion. We completed successful wiring from the common femoral vein to the vena cava. Proximal protection to avoid a thromboembolism was deemed unnecessary in this case. After passing the wire, we were unable to get confirmation of the wire resting in a vessel by intravascular ultrasound. The patient had no pain, and her vital signs were stable. However, we decided to use a stent graft on this lesion for safety and to maintain blood flow. After balloon dilatation, we inserted two stents (VIABAHN\u00ae [W.L.GORE & Associates, Inc.

    "rewritten_case": "A 72-year-old Asian woman presented with complaints of recent severe left leg swelling and intermittent claudication at 200 m that began 2 years ago. She had been taking Rivaroxaban following an initial diagnosis based on contrast-enhanced CT. Despite treatment for over a year, her symptoms did not show significant improvement, leading to her referral to our department for further analysis. Her medical history included depression and endometriosis, for which she had undergone a total hysterectomy. She had given birth twice and had no remarkable family medical history, smoking or alcohol habits, or distinctive socioeconomic background. Her daily medication regimen included rivaroxaban, spironolactone, lorazepam, eszopiclone, duloxetine, bromazepam, pantothenic acid, brotizolam, olanzapine, triazolam, and magnesium oxide.\n\nOn physical examination, her heart rate was 72 bpm, blood pressure was 130/74 mmHg, body temperature was 36.2 \u00b0C, and SpO2 was 98%. Inspection of the left lower limb revealed swelling and edema with moderate tenderness and mild pain, while the right lower limb appeared normal. No other significant findings were noted during the physical and neurological examination.\n\nBlood tests revealed normal TP, albumin, BUN, Cre, uric acid, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, AST, ALT, \u03b3-GTP, T-bil, ALP, LDH, CK, Amy, Na, K, Cl, CRP, Fe, HbA1c, eGFR, WBC, Hb, Plt, PT, APTT, PT-INR, D-dimer, HCV antibody, HIV Ag/ab, HBs antigen, anti-cardiolipin IgG antibody, lupus anticoagulant, protein S activity, and protein C activity. Urine analysis was also within normal ranges.\n\nDuring her visit, the patient mentioned a recent onset of blurry vision in her left eye. An emergency ophthalmologic evaluation was performed, revealing retinal hemorrhages and dilated tortuous retinal veins, characteristic of a central retinal vein occlusion. The clinical picture was complicated by the left leg symptoms, suggesting a possible systemic venous thromboembolic event.\n\nFurther investigation with enhanced computed tomography (e-CT) revealed vein-to-vein collateral formation and multiple arteriovenous fistulas from the common iliac and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac and common femoral veins. Unfortunately, her symptoms continued to worsen despite the initiation of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and standard compression therapy at her previous hospital. \n\nDetailed angiography confirmed the arteriovenous fistulas from the common and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac vein, with left external iliac vein flow moving proximally to distally. Ultrasound findings disclosed high-velocity arterialized waveforms in the external iliac and femoral veins. \n\nAn initial consideration for surgical repair was dismissed due to the complex morphology and number of fistulas. Her condition progressively worsened, leading to the decision for endovascular treatment. The patient was fully informed and consented to the procedure. After successful treatment, her overall condition improved, although the underlying cause of her symptoms remained a topic of discussion.",

The headache was without pain dissemination, feelings of heart palpitation, or nausea. She took 100 mg diclofenac suppository every day, but no improvement was observed in symptoms. No seizure or loss of consciousness had been reported. She felt fatigue as her sleep duration increased and her daily activities slowed down. At the same time, chickenpox lesions appeared on the surface of the skin and low-grade fever continued during those 11 days. The patient was married 5 years ago and has a 5-year-old child. In her history, she has had only one pregnancy without any abortion or stillbirth. Her menstruation period was regular, and the volume of bleeding was within the normal range. Before her pregnancy, a 3-cm myoma had been diagnosed by ultrasound. Owing to the breech position of the fetus and gradual increase in myoma size up to 30 cm, cesarean section was selected by horizontal incision. Laparoscopic myomectomy was performed 1 year after delivery, and owing to abdominal pain and discomfort, endometriosis was diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) scan at the site of the cesarean section about 3 years later. Continuous use of Diane-35 for 3 months was advised by her physician. Diane is a combination of cyproterone and ethinyl estradiol. At the onset of the headache, she had been taking the Diane tablet for 45 days. At the time, she had been taking painkiller drugs and the Diane tablet. She has no past systemic medical history or positive family history for neurological and gynecological problems. She was hospitalized. The necessary physical and laboratory examinations were performed, and the results were as follows: Glasgow score (GCS) was 15/15, cranial and funduscopic examinations were normal, no double vision had occurred, and Kernig\u2019s sign, Brudzinski\u2019s sign, and neck redor were negative.

Although lactate dehydrogenase was elevated to 1728 U/L, and total bilirubin and potassium were also elevated, direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative ().\n\n Results of laboratory examination at diagnosis Full size table Bone marrow aspiration showed hyperplasia and megaloblastic change of erythroblasts, both of which are indicative of megaloblastic anemia. Dysplasia of granulocytes was also confirmed, and the percentage of megakaryocytes was decreased . While further examinations were being performed, the patient suddenly developed pulmonary hemorrhage, resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest. Although the patient responded to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he developed severe hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Subsequently, he was started on intensive care including hemodialysis, plasma exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and frequent blood transfusions. On the fifth day of hospitalization, serum folate level was found to be undetectable (normal, 11\u201334 nmol/L). This led us to confirm that folate deficiency was the cause of the megaloblastic anemia. Although intravenous folate supplementation (folinic acid, 6 mg/day) was initiated, the patient died of circulatory failure 19 days after hospitalization . Examination of autopsy samples revealed that the megaloblastic change in his bone marrow had disappeared; however, the cause of pulmonary hemorrhage could not be confirmed. An amino acid analysis conducted before intravenous folate replenishment indicated high levels of serum homocysteine, serum cysteine, and urine cysteine, and a low level of serum methionine, which normalized after the administration of medication (). In Japan, all newborns are screened for metabolic disorders. On reanalysis of his neonatal blood sample, methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine levels were found to be normal (). Thus, the abnormal pattern of amino acids was consistent with HFM.\n\nFig. 1 Bone marrow smear examination at diagnosis.

Conservative treatment was given for left-sided condylar process fracture, axis fracture, right clavicle fracture, and right fracture of the distal radius. After his consciousness disorder improved, 4 months after injury, it became clear that the patient was unable to close his mouth. His TMJ may have been dislocated during intubation. The mouth presented in an open state, with lip closure incapacity (Fig. 1 a, b). Stenosis of the jaw dentition was demonstrated with labioclination of the front tooth, open bite, and xerostomia. The patient had a tracheostomy and could not evaluate the verbal response, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 11. Traumatic brain injury left paralysis of his right upper extremity. The patient was at high risk of aspiration pneumonia due to diminished swallowing function, so the previous doctor had performed an additional gastrostomy, which recovered his ability to eat.\n\nFig. 1 Facial photographs before treatment.

After craniotomy operation of the temporal region at right side. a Right side; b left side Full size image\n\nWe attempted a manual reduction owing to the existing diagnosis of old left condylar fracture and bilateral anterior dislocation of the TMJ, but reduction was impossible. Therefore, we planned to perform right condylar resection using an intraoral approach. In addition, we evaluated the planned procedure using a three-dimensional model and confirmed that it would not disturb the jaw reposition, because the left condylar process fractures to medial. We confirmed that it was difficult to reduce and fix the old fracture and that it did not interfere with the reproduction of the original occlusion on the three-dimensional model, so we decided to treat it conservatively. We performed right condylectomy with the patient under general anesthesia. Manual reduction was performed again in a state of muscle relaxation, but reduction was not possible. After an incision was made in the buccal mucosa according to the sagittal split ramus osteotomy, the inside and outside of the mandibular ramus was revealed, and the coronoid process and the neck of the mandible were confirmed . The coronoid process obstructed the visual field, so it was cut and resected with a reciprocating saw . Using a saw and osteotome, the base of the condylar was cut and separated from the surrounding soft tissue to remove the condylar head (Fig. 3 c, d). We confirmed that the mandibular body had moved backward and that the molars could achieve the occlusion, and the wound was closed. Intermaxillary traction was started during the postoperative period using an intermaxillary fixation screw inserted in the alveolar region to improve occlusal deviation. Twenty-one days after the operation, a normal occlusion was obtained, and intermaxillary fixation screw was removed. During the 12-month postoperative follow-up period, no TMJ dislocation recurred, and the occlusion remained stable . After the operation, he was able to open and close the mouth by himself, and the lips could be closed, so that hypersalivation did not occur. His left condylar process was displaced inward owing to a fracture, but the opening and closing movements were possible because the hinge movement centered on the left condylar process.\n\nFig. 3 Right coronoid process and the neck of the mandible (a).

He was admitted that same day for consideration of urgent chemotherapy given the size and number of his pulmonary metastases. CT-guided biopsy of right lung mass was consistent with high-grade findings. Orthopedic evaluation determined he was not a surgical candidate for a hemipelvectomy given the extensive lung disease and oxygen requirements. Systemic chemotherapy was initiated with a planned 28-day cycle of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) over 2 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) over 4 hours on days 1 through 3. Prior to doxorubicin being started, the patient decompensated requiring additional supplemental oxygen support with high-flow nasal cannula (50 L, 60%). Laboratory results were not consistent with TLS; potassium and phosphorus were within reference ranges and unchanged from prior, while uric acid was slightly elevated (8.5 mg/dL, reference range upper limit of normal 8.2 mg/dL). Repeat CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism. Given worsening bilateral lower-extremity edema and significant fluid administration with cisplatin, hypervolemia was determined to be the cause of his worsening respiratory status, and the patient was diuresed with intravenous furosemide. He developed a multifactorial acute kidney injury (AKI) (CT contrast, cisplatin), though it resolved over time without hemodialysis. As his respiratory status improved, he received 3 days of doxorubicin therapy to complete cycle 1 of cisplatin/doxorubicin. Ten days after the completion of doxorubicin, the patient was briefly transferred to the MICU for hypotension, while in the ICU he was found to have an extended spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli bacteremia that was treated with meropenem. The remainder of his hospital course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged home with home intravenous (IV) antibiotics and oxygen on hospital day (HD) 28.  \nThird hospitalization  \nThe patient was readmitted 9 days later for scheduled cycle 2 of cisplatin/doxorubicin systemic treatment. Shortly after the cisplatin and doxorubicin infusions were started on HD 0 (34 days after initial cisplatin dose), he became more hypoxic, requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support to maintain his saturation. IV fluids and chemotherapy were immediately held, and the patient was upgraded to the progressive care unit (step down). At the time, the patient was clinically volume overloaded with significant bilateral lower-extremity edema. Over the next several days, the patient was diuresed; he continued to require BiPAP support to maintain SpO2 \u2265 92%. Given persistent hypervolemia, the decision was made for a trial of reduced dose ifosfamide (1000 mg/m2) monotherapy, with the plan to give daily on days 1 through 5. The patient received his first dose of ifosfamide on HD 7. On HD 8, the patient developed worsening hypoxia and tachypnea. The patient developed worsening metabolic and respiratory acidosis, and the diagnosis of TLS was made. The patient's laboratory values are summarized in .  \n Review of tumor lysis syndrome in sarcomas  \nFull size table  \nThe patient was treated with 4 mg of rasburicase, IV furosemide, and intravenous fluids. In accordance with patient and family wishes, the patient was not intubated for respiratory failure and hemodialysis was not offered. Overnight into HD 9, the patient continued to have worsening lactic acidosis despite maximal medical management and noninvasive ventilatory support. The patient\u2019s sinus tachycardia decompensated to asystolic cardiac arrest on HD 9, and he was pronounced deceased.",
    "rewritten_case": "Prior medical history \nThe patient is a 64-year-old Asian male with a past medical record of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had a personal history of high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma, diagnosed 7 years prior to his presentation, staged as cT2N0M0 with a Gleason score of 4 + 5 = 9. He underwent definitive radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with leuprolide depot for 2 years. His prostate specific antigen remained less than (nadir + 2), with a nadir of 0.12, while off ADT. \n\nFirst hospitalization \nThe patient approached his primary care physician with a right-sided thigh mass. Before a thorough workup could be performed, he arrived at the emergency department (ED) with progressive shortness of breath and right lower-extremity edema. He was found to be tachycardic and hypoxic in the ED and was admitted for further investigation. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed numerous pulmonary metastases up to 4.0 cm in size. A contrast CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large, multilobulated, destructive mass in the superomedial right thigh and pelvis with associated pathologic fractures, as well as multiple hepatic lesions. A core biopsy of the right lower-extremity soft tissue mass was consistent with high-grade findings and stained positive for vimentin.
