    "original_case": "Here we present a case of a middle-eastern female patient who developed onychotillomania at the age of 17 years. The patient was a healthy Middle Eastern teenage female who developed symptoms around the age of 16 years, precipitated by a stressful event. The patient experienced recurrent, intrusive, distressing, and time-consuming obsessional thoughts of being surveilled through her phone. These obsessions also made her functionally impaired. Consequently, the patient started to avoid using the phone and eventually damaged it. Nevertheless, her symptoms persisted even with a new phone. Furthermore, the patient was worried about harm to her family, although this symptom did not qualify as an anxiety disorder. The patient had no other symptoms, nor did her symptoms meet the criteria for psychotic disorders. She was under the care of another physician at the time of onset of the condition, and was treated with fluoxetine, which was changed to paroxetine with clear justification. The patient commenced paroxetine 20 mg titrated to 30 mg daily and started showing improvements. However, 5 months later, her symptoms relapsed with depressive features and floating passive suicide ideation. Additionally, she demonstrated nail picking that was mainly directed towards the big toes and the skin around the nails using only her fingers. On examination, the lateral nail fold was erythematous and swollen with bleeding in both big toes, which may indicate a distolateral ingrowth and the nails showed scales and signs of distal nail tearing by the patient. Sometimes the patient\u2019s injuries required bandaging (Figs. 1 and 2). These symptoms were distressing, occurred daily, and were preceded by an urge and followed by a relief. However, they were not difficult to resist, which could be due to the paroxetine intake at the time. This complaint was not related to anxiety or depressive symptoms, and the patient had no other body-focused repetitive behaviors. Subsequently, the dose of paroxetine was increased to 40 mg. Two months later, the patient started to experience side effects that included weight gain and difficulty in urination. Medication was switched to fluoxetine at a dose of 20 mg titrated, which was later increased to 40 mg daily. After the resolution of symptoms, upon the patient\u2019s request, 6\u20137 months later, the medication was reduced. The fluoxetine dose was tapered and discontinued over 3 months without any relapse in symptoms. However, 2\u20133 months later, the symptoms relapsed and treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg was recommenced. At the time of writing this report, approximately 2 months after restarting fluoxetine, the patient\u2019s condition had partially improved and the nail-picking behavior remained remitted.",
    "rewritten_case": "Here we present a case of a female patient of Middle Eastern descent who developed onychotillomania at a young age. The patient displayed symptoms of obsessive thoughts related to surveillance through her phone, leading to functional impairment and avoidance behaviors.

OCD is a mental disorder characterized by persistent and recurrent unwanted thoughts, images, or impulses (obsessions) that cause distress and lead to repetitive behaviors or mental rituals (compulsions) intended to reduce the associated anxiety or distress. Onychophagia is a form of self-mutilation and a common form of dermatillomania, which is a type of OCD. It is characterized by the persistent picking of one's skin, often resulting in bleeding, infection, or scarring.",

For the last 2 years, pain at the right wrist joint level and fourth finger flexion failure had also occurred. All the symptoms were induced by wrist and fourth finger flexion and extension. Recently, the patient had noted weakening of the right wrist. Examination did not reveal any visible or palpable pathology at the wrist level. Weakening of the right wrist was noted while the patient was grabbing the examiners\u2019 hand. Neurological examination revealed reduced sensitivity (pain) via the median nerve area at the right wrist. Triggering at the right wrist was noted during flexion and extension of the radiocarpal joint. Despite the obvious presence of carpal tunnel syndrome, Tinel\u2019s sign was not present. MRI of the right wrist was performed: no pathological masses were seen inside the carpal tunnel. The compression of the right median nerve was confirmed by electroneuromyography. Carpal tunnel release was performed. The tumor was attached to the flexor superficialis tendon sheath and was moving through the carpal tunnel via fourth finger and wrist flexion and extension. The tumor was excised, and the wound was closed . A morphological study was performed . Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for differential diagnosis with peripheral nerve tumors .

She had no history of illness, and biochemical parameters and tumor markers were within normal limits. Helicobacter pylori antibodies were negative, and EGD showed atrophic changes associated with previous H. pylori infection. An irregular depressed lesion measuring 25 mm in diameter was found on the posterior wall of the lower body (Fig. 1 a, b). Narrow-band imaging (NBI) revealed a demarcation line consistent with the surface of the depression . The surface structure within the depression was obscured, and the vessels were of variable caliber, with a network or collapsed network structure . Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with a well-differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma [tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1\u20132)], and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed . The resected specimen had the following histological parameters: 28\u2009\u00d7\u200928 mm, type 0\u2013IIc, pT1b(submucosa (SM) 900 \u03bcm), pUL(\u2212), Ly(+), v(\u2212), pHM0, pVM0 . Histologically, the tumor was composed of two components [tub2 adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (NEC)], and it showed submucosal and lymphatic invasion. As shown in Fig. 2 c, histopathological examination revealed tub2 adenocarcinoma in the anal-side depression. In the oral-side depression, tumor cells lacked glandular structures and had nested trabecular or acinar-like structures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for synaptophysin and CD56, and chromogranin partially, confirming the diagnosis of NEC. We determined that additional surgical resection was necessary due to submucosal and lymphatic invasion and laparoscopic pyloric gastrectomy was performed.

Going through his medical records, we realized that he had undergone an open right subclavian artery bypass for acute right upper extremity ischemia caused by thrombosis in the aneurysmal right subclavian artery to the distal arterial branches around 1.5 years ago. However, follow-up imaging suggested occlusion in the bypass area. Given the history of recurrent oral aphthous lesions and extensive body folliculitis lesions, a specific condition was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 test, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 79, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 5.2 (normal: 0.5), as well as pathological findings from the open right subclavian artery bypass surgery. Cyclophosphamide therapy was the treatment of choice for the patient, but due to infertility concerns, he refused. Therefore, he was treated with azathioprine 100 mg daily, prednisolone 30 mg daily, colchicine 1 mg daily, and rivaroxaban 20 mg daily postoperatively. The patient\u2019s compliance was good, and according to the latest rheumatological reports prior to his admission to our facility, his condition was under control and no hypercoagulable symptoms were observed. After admitting the patient, with all his past history in mind, we requested a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) with suspicion of a vascular pathology causing pressure effect on the recurrent laryngeal nerves. CTA revealed a 32 \u00d7 27 mm ruptured pseudoaneurysm originating from innominate artery bifurcation with a 90 \u00d7 61 \u00d7 65 mm hematoma extending to the right shoulder and forming an extrapleural hematoma at the apex of the right thoracic cavity . The trachea was deviated to the left side due to the mass effect of the pseudoaneurysm. Despite total occlusion of the right subclavian and axillary arteries by thrombosis, the patient had no complaint regarding his right upper extremity, which shows that there was probably sufficient collateral blood perfusion. Even though we retrospectively reexamined his previous CTA from the former admission, no anomaly was found in the innominate artery. We decided to repair the ruptured pseudoaneurysm by an endovascular approach. Preoperatively, the patient received methylprednisolone to decrease postoperative complications. In a hybrid operation room, we performed a digital subtraction angiography. Unfortunately, owing to the lack of proper landing zone, we could not perform an endovascular repair by stent graft. Inevitably, we approached the pseudoaneurysm by a median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension. After excising the ruptured pseudoaneurysm and evacuating the surrounding hematoma, we performed an innominate artery to the right common carotid artery bypass with a 6 mm expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft, which passed right behind the innominate vein . The pressure effect of the pseudoaneurysm was removed from the right recurrent laryngeal, phrenic, and vagus nerves with no neural damage. We decided not to perform a right subclavian artery bypass since it was previously thrombosed, and the patient had no complaint concerning the right upper extremity.",

Initial tests revealed a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 result, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 79, and an increased C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5.2. Pathological findings from the previous bypass surgery supported the suspicion of a specific condition. Treatment options were discussed, with cyclophosphamide initially recommended but declined by the patient due to concerns about infertility. Instead, he was started on azathioprine, prednisolone, colchicine, and rivaroxaban postoperatively.\n\nDuring the patient's current admission, a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to investigate a suspected vascular pathology affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Surprisingly, the CTA revealed a 32 \u00d7 27 mm ruptured pseudoaneurysm originating from the innominate artery bifurcation with a large hematoma extending to the right shoulder and forming an extrapleural hematoma in the right thoracic cavity. This finding raised concerns about a possible vascular anomaly causing pressure on the nerves.\n\nDespite the presence of a ruptured pseudoaneurysm, the patient did not experience symptoms in his right upper extremity, suggesting adequate collateral blood perfusion. Further evaluation of the innominate artery did not reveal any anomalies, leading to a decision to repair the pseudoaneurysm using an endovascular approach. However, due to anatomical challenges, the endovascular repair with a stent graft was not feasible, necessitating a median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension.\n\nIntraoperatively, the ruptured pseudoaneurysm was excised, and an innominate artery to right common carotid artery bypass was performed using a polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft. The procedure successfully relieved the pressure on the adjacent nerves without causing any damage. Given the previous thrombosis in the right subclavian artery and the absence of symptoms in the right upper extremity, a decision was made not to perform a bypass for the right subclavian artery.\n\nThe patient's condition was complex, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to address the pseudoaneurysm and prevent further complications.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T1 weighting showed a linear low signal and an equivalent signal surrounding it at the right supra-acetabulum, and the linear low signal and high signal surrounding it were seen on the T2-weighted image. The lesion was not suppressed by short TI inversion recovery. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed the lesion gradually enhanced . A malignant bone tumor at right supra-acetabulum was suspected by CT and MRI, and he was referred to our department. Blood testing was carried out for differential diagnosis considering bone metastasis from carcinoma or secondary osteoporosis. There were no inflammatory findings in the blood results, nor were there any abnormalities in his electrolytes, thyroid hormones, or tumor markers. Moreover, nuclear examinations were performed to distinguish between benign or malignant and to check whether there were other bone lesions.

He was treated with immunomodulators including an initial treatment of azathioprine 50 mg and prednisolone 15 mg twice daily, and mesalazine. Owing to remission of the clinical symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease, prednisolone was gradually tapered off; prednisone use covered a total period of 3 months. Following 4 months of azathioprine and 3 months of prednisolone use, the patient complained of persistent abdominal pain and diarrhea. Endoscopy in March 2019 revealed scarring in the colon and terminal ileum. Furthermore, inflammatory polypoid lesions were noted in the terminal ileum that were not present in a previous examination . Results of a biopsy revealed that spindle cells were arranged in intersecting fascicles with intervening slit-like vascular spaces containing erythrocytes located in the submucosal layer. Immunohistochemistry revealed immunoreactivity for CD34, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and HHV-8. Stainings for CD117, DOG1, and cytomegalovirus were all negative .

He had been hospitalized for 1 month at a public hospital in Natal, Brazil, with initial symptoms of intense diarrhea, daily fevers, sweating, and chills for 3 weeks. He was diagnosed with disseminated TB, and tuberculostatic treatment (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide) was given for 10 days. However, due to increased transaminase levels, his regimen was changed to levofloxacin, capreomycin, and ethambutol. He was observed for 10 days and discharged. Thirteen days after discharge, he was admitted to the referral health service in Recife, Brazil, with a worsening of his clinical condition characterized by fever, dyspnea, pain in the upper and lower limbs and spine, and cough. Prophylactic treatment with sulfamethoxazole\u2009+\u2009trimethoprim + piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated. Lymphocyte counts showed that patient was severely immunocompromised, with a CD4 count of 8 cells/mL, CD8 count of 347 cells/mL, and CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.02. A high viral load was detected (174,034 copies). Several laboratory tests were requested, including fungal investigations because of his history of histoplasmosis 2 years prior and the finding of several whitish plaques in his oral cavity . Blood culture, bronchoalveolar lavage, and oral secretions were obtained. The samples were sent to the Laboratory of Diagnostic in Tropical Diseases at the Federal University of Pernambuco, and slides were made for direct examination (Fig. 1b, c) to visualize fungal structures. Spherical yeast cells were observed in large numbers.

There was rapid growth with sporulation after 3 days of culture. Yeasts were identified using the VITEK\u00ae 2 automated microbial identification system (bioM\u00e9rieux SA, Marcy-l'\u00c9toile, France) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight\u2013mass spectrometry according to Lima-Neto et al.

In vitro antifungal susceptibility tests were performed according to the protocol described in the 2008 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M27-A3 [12] and using the VITEK\u00ae 2 system with the AST YS01 card; both tests confirmed the identification. Candida tropicalis isolates showed resistance to fluconazole and voriconazole, for which the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were 64 and 16 \u00b5g/mL, respectively; the MICs for anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, and amphotericin B were 0.125, 0.03, 0.125, and 0.25 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The patient was diagnosed with esophagitis. Treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate and itraconazole with a maintenance dose was instituted. After 12 days of hospitalization, the patient developed sepsis from a pulmonary focus and his respiratory status worsened, leading to nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation. Meropenem and vancomycin were started, and itraconazole (400 mg/day) was maintained. Laboratory tests showed significant pancytopenia. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed pericardial thickening, a sequelae of tuberculous pericarditis (Fig. 1d\u2013f). Two days after the end of antibiotic therapy, the patient developed new fever peaks, and the medical staff chose to prolong the medication for another 10 days.

Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse narrowing of the bronchial lumen with marked submucosal lymphocytic infiltration. Despite initial treatment with antibiotics and inhaled corticosteroids, there was no improvement in symptoms. Follow-up imaging demonstrated improvement in bronchial wall thickening with corticosteroid therapy. An unexpected finding was an abnormal level of D-dimer, which raised concerns for pulmonary embolism. Further investigations were initiated to rule out this possibility, leading to a delay in the correct diagnosis of UC-related tracheobronchitis.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nAssistant: The most likely diagnosis is ulcerative colitis (UC)-related tracheobronchitis. The patient's medical history of UC and the presence of diffuse narrowing of the bronchial lumen with marked submucosal lymphocytic infiltration on bronchoscopy are consistent with this diagnosis.",

    "original_case": "A 44-year-old female living with HIV and on ART for the last 14 years, with a CD4 count of 338 cells/\u00b5L and viral load < 20 copies/mL presented to the hospital with a history of being unwell for a week. She had been put on abacavir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir 3 weeks before, as a routine switch from a TDF-based regimen. She had previously been on a regimen of TDF, 3TC, and efavirenz but had it changed because of the availability of a new formulation of ABC, 3TC, and DTG (Triumeq) that was deemed better by her primary physician. She reported a dry cough, sore throat, chest discomfort, and myalgia. She also reported a history of vomiting 3 days before the hospital visit. She was subject to fever and chills, was anorexic and nauseous. She also complained of occasional headaches, without neck stiffness or photophobia. She had been tested for malaria a couple of times a few days prior, but was persistently negative. At presentation, her blood pressure was 142/84 mmHg, heart rate 102 beats per minute, with temperature 36.1 \u00b0C and oxygen saturation at 94% on ambient air. On examination, she had an inflamed throat and posterior palate with tender tonsils to palpation, her chest was clear and the cardiovascular system examination was otherwise unremarkable. She also had tenderness to palpation of the limb muscles without evidence of arthritis. Remarkably, she had a white cell count of 2.6 \u00d7 10^9/L (73% granulocytes, 22% lymphocytes), hemoglobin of 14.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 122 \u00d7 10^9/L, but her kidney function tests were within normal. The rest of the laboratory results are outlined in Additional file 1: Table S1. She was admitted for intravenous rehydration and bed rest, with a presumption of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, the sore throat persisted despite the initial relief. On the second day of admission, she complained of generalized body ache. Laboratory results showed a significant increase in liver enzymes, thus prompting testing for viral hepatitis and repeat testing for malaria, which turned positive, and she was subsequently started on artesunate. The patient was advised to suspend her ART given the liver impairments. She responded well to treatment and the transaminases started to improve, although she kept complaining of myalgias and progressive body swelling with paresthesia in the lower limbs. She was discharged on the seventh day feeling better. She was, however, readmitted a day after discharge (ninth day since the first admission) complaining of an episode of severe headache followed by profuse sweating. She denied fever but reported that she had vomited six times that day and had three episodes of diarrhea with burning lower abdominal pains. Her blood pressure was 87/50 mmHg, heart rate 130 beats per minute, temperature 35.4 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 88%. Apart from a tender epigastrium, systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable. She was started on rabeprazole, antibiotics to cover hospital acquired infection, and ondansetron. Unfortunately, cultures were not taken. She was also started on Ringer\u2019s lactate. Significantly, her laboratory results showed features of acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 183 \u00b5mol/L. On the second day of this admission, she developed a rash in the extremities that spread to the trunk, she was started on cetirizine and mometasone cream. As her blood pressure improved, the kidney function improved. In addition, there was a notable improvement in the liver transaminases compared with previous tests. The rash also improved. She was discharged after 5 days (13 days after the initial admission). However, the patient was readmitted the night of the day of discharge, in a hysterical state with burning chest pain and chills. Her blood pressure was 108/67 mmHg, heart rate 153 beats per minute, temperature 34.2 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Systemic examination was unremarkable. There was no notable rash at this time. A bedside electrocardiogram was unremarkable apart from the extreme tachycardia and an arterial blood gas report consistent with respiratory alkalosis with lactate of 4.3 mmol/L. However, there was a highly elevated serum level of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium. On further interrogation, the patient revealed that she had taken the ABC-containing tablets shortly before she became unwell and she had vomited a while after that. It was also noted that the patient had been restarting her ART every time she was discharged, contrary to advice. The patient was managed supportively and showed marked improvement, although she still had peripheral neuropathy of the left lower limb requiring physiotherapy and the use of a crutch. On clinical suspicion, an HLA-B*57:01 test was requested. This proved positive and the patient was advised to completely stop the ABC/DTG/3TC regimen. She was discharged after a 2-day stay at the hospital. On follow-up, she did well. She presented 12 days later (27 days after the initial presentation) with severe headaches and episodes of confusion. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a left posterior parietal tuberculoma. She was started on rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, and then rifampicin and isoniazid for 16 months (this was occasioned by persistent symptoms at 12 months and persistent but shrinking tuberculoma). She received a short course of dexamethasone at the beginning of this treatment. Two months after the initial presentation, her ART regimen was changed to a two-tablet regime consisting of DTG and a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine plus TDF. This was occasioned by a rise in the HIV viral load with stable liver and kidney function test results while on antituberculous therapy. She made tremendous improvement overall, although she has persistent headaches 24 months after the first episode. The most recent CD4 count is 512 cells/\u00b5L and viral load is 22 copies/mL. The timeline of events is summarized in Fig. 1.",

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Chinese man who suffered from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm underwent craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation. No problems with swallowing or speaking were reported during the surgery. Unfortunately, the patient experienced dysarthria, dysphagia, and trouble with tongue movement after the surgery. Thus, we performed a detailed neurological examination. In addition to the symptoms described above, we also found symptoms linked to cranial nerve injuries, such as a weakened pharyngeal reflex, tongue deviation toward the affected side, atrophy of tongue muscle, and so on. Further evaluations and imaging examinations were carried out. The rating of the functional oral intake scale (FOIS) was level 2. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) showed that the contrast agent leaked into the vestibule of the larynx and entered the trachea through the glottis when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid . The rating of Rosenbek leakage/aspiration scale was level 8, which is the worst level. When the patient drank 3 ml of medium-thick semi-fluid liquid, effective swallowing was not initiated and the epiglottis valley had a large amount of residue. When examined through the electronic laryngoscope, we noticed paralysis of bilateral vocal folds . All these observations indicated that the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve had been injured. Therefore, we thought that there may be a lesion in or near the brainstem that led to nerve injury. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that there were no brainstem lesions , and that the symptoms that arose after surgery could not be explained by the left frontal lobe malacia and subdural hematoma . Owing to the inconformity of symptoms and radiographic results, we decided to analyze the rare case again. When we reviewed the clinical history, we noticed that the surgery was performed under general anesthesia and transoral intubation, so there may be a connection between transoral intubation and nerve injury. After consulting with the ear\u2013nose\u2013throat (ENT) and anesthesiology departments, we excluded arytenoid dislocation and violent intubation. Then we found that these symptoms are similar to those of a specific syndrome, so we compared the characteristics of this case with diagnostic criteria of that syndrome. First, in terms of clinical history, the majority of cases occur following the surgical intervention under general anesthesia and transoral intubation. Our patient went through craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation before these symptoms arose. Second, symptoms of the patient included difficulties in tongue movement, unilateral tongue paralysis, and atrophy of the tongue, as well as hoarseness and dysphagia, which matches the described symptoms of that syndrome. Third, the complete neurological examination showed that there are cranial nerve injuries and, based on the MRI results, we excluded lesions in the brainstem. Hence the symptoms are likely caused by peripheral nerve injuries. Thus, a diagnosis was made. Fig. 1 Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). A Aspiration occurred when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid. (before treatment, arrow, left). B A small amount of leakage when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid.

In the previous studies of that syndrome, only standard swallowing training was used as rehabilitation treatment, which proved to be effective but still means a lengthy recovery process. So we decided to include electroacupuncture as a measure in our treatment to observe the effect. The patient received acupuncture treatment 30 minutes per day, six times per week for 52 days . Qi She brand disposable, sterile steel needles (0.25\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm; Wuxi Jiajian Medical Instrument Co. Ltd) were used. Based on our experience in treating similar diseases, we chose several acupoints to improve deglutition and speech function. These acupoints included the three-needle tongue (Shanglianquan, located in the depression between the lingual bone and the border of the lower jaw, 1 cun inferior to the midline of the jaw), and two other acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (note that the width of the interphalangeal joint of the patient\u2019s thumb is taken as 1 cun, approximately 25 mm), Dicang (ST 4, with the eyes looking straight forward, the point is vertically below the pupil, at the level of the angle of the mouth), Taixi (KI 3, in the depression between the tip of the medial malleolus and Achilles\u2019 tendon), and Zhaohai (KI 6, in the depression below the tip of the medial malleolus). Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation (EA parameters were set as follows: discontinuous wave with frequency 5 Hz, pulse width 1 ms, and intensity approximately 2 mA, until a slight jitter in the muscle is observed) was applied to two acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (EX). No side effects such as bleeding or hematoma were observed during the entire treatment. Fig. 4 The location of acupoints. Acupoints on face and neck (three-needle tongue and Dicang).

Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; the patient was referred to our department for surgery. He had hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, he had no family history of malignancy. The patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, D1+\u2009lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction in November 2019. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged 6\u00a0days postoperatively. The initial surgical specimen findings were as follows : a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200935-mm 0\u2013IIc lesion with shallow depression ranging from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature. Histopathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins that were staged IA (pT1aN0M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors, 8th edition.

Although partial thickening of the gastric wall was seen retrospectively in a 1-year postoperative CT scan, it was reviewed within normal limits by a radiologist at that time . No evidence of recurrent metastasis was found at other sites. Fig. 2 One\u00a0year postoperatively (a), 2\u00a0years postoperatively (b). The soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach is enlarged.\u00a0The arrows show the soft tissue mass Full size image The blood test findings were as follows: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 1.8\u00a0ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), 8.5 U/mL; and soluble IL-2 receptor, 396 U/mL. Colonoscopy had been performed prior to the first surgery; hence, it was not performed again. The FDG-PET/CT findings were as follows : The soft tissue mass on the left side of the residual stomach showed moderate FDG accumulation (SUVmax, 5.25). No FDG accumulation was observed in other areas. Malignant lesions, including recurrent gastric cancer and regional lymph node metastasis, were suspected; however, qualitative diagnosis was difficult. No abnormal accumulation indicating recurrence and metastasis occurred at other sites. Fig. 3 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography. The soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach shows FDG accumulation (SUVmax 5.25). The arrows show the soft tissue mass. FDG fluorodeoxyglucose Full size image Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed the following findings : the soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach exhibited a high, heterogenous signal on T2-weighted images and a low signal on T1-weighted images, and contrast imaging revealed a slow contrast effect. Other malignant lesions such as gastric cancer recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) were considered as possible differential diagnoses; however, none of the findings were typical, and qualitative diagnosis was difficult. Fig. 4 Magnetic resonance imaging. T2-weighted image showing a heterogeneous high signal.\u00a0The arrows show the soft tissue mass Full size image Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings were as follows : no mass lesions were present in the remnant stomach. Transgastric ultrasonography revealed a 43\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u00a0mm borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum, which was biopsied using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Fig. 5 Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. A borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum Full size image The biopsy results were as follows: the tumor contained multiple spindle-shaped cells, and immunostaining for CD34, c-kit, desmin, S-100, and \u03b2-catenin was performed to distinguish spindle-shaped tumors; however, no significant positive findings were obtained. The biopsy specimen did not allow us to estimate the histological type of the tumor as it did not conclusively suggest a GIST, smooth myxoid, or schwannoma. Based on the above-mentioned examination results, local recurrence of gastric cancer, lymph node metastasis, a GIST, a smooth myxoid, and a schwannoma were regarded as possible differential diagnoses. Although the possibility of a benign tumor remained, a definitive diagnosis could not be made histopathologically, and moderate FDG accumulation could not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, we decided to operate for diagnostic treatment. Preoperative CT revealed a suspicious finding of splenic arteriovenous invasion; therefore, total residual gastrectomy and splenectomy were planned. The surgical findings were as follows: the abdomen was opened via a median upper abdominal incision. A 50\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u00a0mm soft tissue mass originating from the gastrojejunal anastomosis involving the spleen and splenic arteriovenous was observed on the greater curvature side of the anastomosis. Additionally, a partial invasion of the pancreas was observed. The remaining stomach, spleen, splenic artery and vein, and part of the pancreas, including the gastrojejunal anastomosis, along with the soft tissue mass, were removed as a single lump. Regarding reconstruction, only esophago-jejunal anastomosis was performed, sparing previous jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. The operation time was 279\u00a0minutes, and blood loss was 1100\u00a0mL; however, no blood transfusion was required. Pathological findings of the resected specimen were as follows : a 45\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200940-mm soft tissue mass extending from the muscularis propria to the serosa at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The tumor was a white, substantial nodule, and its growth involved the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Although fibroblasts and spindle-shaped cells were observed inside the tumor, the Ki-67 index was about 2%, and atypia was not observed. Immunostaining was positive for vimentin, desmin, and \u03b2-catenin and negative for \u03b1-SMA, S-100, CD34, c-kit, STAT6, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PgR).

He had experienced mild pain in his left leg 1 day earlier, but did not experience any shortness of breath or chest pain at this time. Past medical history included minor mitral valve prolapse diagnosed in adolescence and at age 18 years a left tibial tubercle fracture. The patient was a commercial airline pilot and reported an average of 18 days or 90 hour per month spent piloting. He was living in a high-altitude city at the time of symptom presentation. Family history included a cousin with epilepsy and was otherwise non-contributory. The patient was discharged after an unremarkable head computed tomography (CT) scan and was referred to neurology. Neurology ruled out epilepsy as the cause of his seizures. Additional work-up, including electroencephalogram (EEG), was within normal limits. One week after his first seizure and subsequent neurology consult, the patient presented at urgent care with left leg pain and exertional shortness of breath. No imaging or bloodwork was ordered at this time. He was discharged with an erroneous diagnosis of allergies. Later in the same month, he experienced his second seizure, again in the early morning hours, but did not seek emergent medical care. Upon a second evaluation by the neurologist, he was prescribed levetiracetam. In November 2018, the patient presented to the emergency department with 3-day history of shortness of breath, hemoptysis, left calf pain radiating to the popliteal area, and intermittent left midsternal chest pain. The patient underwent an extended period of automobile travel of approximately 20 hour duration 2 weeks prior. The patient\u2019s vitals were BP 145/88, MAP 107 mmHg, temperature 97.8 \u00b0F, HR 93, RR 16, and SaO2 of 95% on RA. Upon physical examination, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no diminished breath sounds. Cardiac auscultation revealed no gallops or murmurs. Radial and femoral pulses were normal bilaterally. No edema was found in the extremities. The neurological examination was within normal limits. Blood work and imaging were subsequently ordered. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm and a rate of 98 bpm. D-dimer was elevated, which prompted further testing. Chest CT chest with intravenous (IV) contrast showed extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism . Clot burden was identified in left and right interlobar arteries extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches without infarction or effusion. IV tPA was administered. A 4-mm lingular nodule was found on CT, and oncological work-up was recommended. Fig. 1 (Left) an axial slice from a CT of the chest obtained during the pulmonary angiographic phase of IV contrast administration demonstrates the largest site of PE in the patient, located in the left proximal interlobar pulmonary artery. (Right) a coronal view demonstrating PE located in the left proximal interlobar pulmonary artery Full size image At this time, the differential diagnosis was still broad. Trousseau\u2019s syndrome was on the differential but was ruled out. Oncologic work-up was negative for malignancy. Laboratory values were within normal limits. The patient had not experienced another seizure. Work-up included full-body CT scan, which revealed findings . Hematological profile was also within normal limits, and the findings were postulated to be the cause of the patient\u2019s clotting and was added to the differential for the underlying cause of his symptom profile. Treatment options were discussed including long-term anticoagulation therapy as a minimally invasive option and venoplasty as an invasive option. The patient wished to proceed with the more definitive option and elected to undergo endovascular venoplasty with stent placement. In March 2019, Interventional Radiology placed bilateral common iliac and right external iliac venous stents to attempt definitive treatment. Stents were placed bilaterally after Doppler flow analysis showed diminished blood flow in both left and right internal iliac veins. Post-catheterization CT with three-dimensional (3D) rendering showed placement position of and patent luminary blood flow through the stents (Figs. 3, 4). Fig. 2 CT scans in all planes with 3D rendering demonstrate severe compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. 3D rendering demonstrates associated changes of the vein underlying the artery Full size image Fig. 3 Intraoperative venograms show ballooning (left), stent deployment (middle), and completion of deployment (right).

It was deemed safe to discontinue heparin and switch to daily aspirin 4 weeks after venoplasty. Six days after discontinuation of heparin, the patient experienced another thrombotic event presenting with left leg pain and shortness of breath. Diagnostic workup, including CT, was significant for PE, and the patient was taken to the interventional radiology suite. The right popliteal vein was accessed in an integrated fashion using a six French vascular sheath. A venogram was performed. A guidewire and catheter were advanced into the common femoral veins bilaterally, and simultaneous iliac venograms were performed. Catheters were then advanced bilaterally into the common iliac stents, and IV contrast was injected. Significant thrombus was demonstrated within the right proximal external iliac vein and bilateral stented common iliac veins. The thrombus also extended proximally into the inferior vena cava (IVC) immediately above the stents as well as distally into the left femoral and popliteal veins . Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy was then performed through each access site, from the left popliteal vein through the left iliac veins and into the IVC, and also from the right external iliac vein into the IVC. Fig. 5 Venography 5 weeks post-stent placement shows stents in place complicated by severe intrastent and intravenous thrombosis extending into the inferior vena cava Full size image Following thrombectomy, 20 cm infusion length catheters were deployed bilaterally. tPA infusion was initiated through each infusion catheter. In addition, to treat the nonocclusive thrombus within the distal left femoral and popliteal veins, tPA was also infused through the access sheath at that site. All sheaths and catheters were secured to the skin, and weight-based heparin was continued. Twenty-four hours later, the patient underwent fluoroscopy which confirmed patency of the treated segments . The patient remained inpatient for monitoring for the next 24 h and was discharged home on apixaban for chemoprophylaxis. The patient tolerated the procedure without complication. Fig. 6 Venography shows patent flow 24 hours after inpatient pharmacomechanical thrombectomy Full size image The patient has since reported no additional seizures, clotting events, or emergency department visits. No other significant disorders have been found, including testing for Factor V Leiden, cancer, thyroid disorders, and patent foramen ovale. Despite the negative hematological testing, the patient remains on lifelong Coumadin in the event of an undiscovered hypercoagulopathy. The care team theorizes that the seizures resulted from hypoxia due to induced hemostasis and associated thrombotic events, the high-altitude location of his residence at the time he experienced the seizures, and shallow breathing during sleep.",

May-Thurner syndrome is a condition in which the left common iliac vein is compressed by the right common iliac artery against the fifth lumbar vertebra, leading to venous hypertension and subsequent superficial venous reflux. This can result in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's history of recurrent DVT and PE, as well as the presence of May-Thurner syndrome, suggests that his seizures may have been linked to hypoxia due to thrombotic events associated with his underlying condition.",

    "original_case": "The patient gave her written consent to the anonymous description and publication of her case report. We present the case of an 84-year-old Caucasian woman suffering from severe pain of the left flank of several weeks\u2019 duration. Prior to the patient\u2019s current hospitalization, as reported here, a decompression and stabilization of the lumbar and thoracic spine had been performed 2 months before in a different neurosurgical clinic. In view of the clinical results and continuing severe pain, an extension of the preexisting spinal fusion from the 4th lumbar vertebral body to the second sacral vertebral body, including a cage implantation, was recommended. The patient presented multiple preexisting conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, diabetic polyneuropathy, moderate valvular aortic stenosis, and restless legs syndrome. Further, the patient introduced herself as a member of the community of JWs. For this reason, she was transferred to the local department of anesthesiology to discuss blood-saving techniques as well as the risks accompanying the procedure, as she was not willing to receive any form of blood transfusion. After the patient\u2019s decision to undergo spinal fusion surgery, an interdisciplinary plan based on the three pillars of PBM was made to provide maximum security for the patient\u2019s outcome. Presurgical assessment Prior to surgery, the patient signed an informed consent document and was asked to decide which types of blood products would be compatible with her beliefs (Additional file 1: Table S1). Initially, the patient\u2019s hemoglobin (Hb) level was 11.5 g/dl, which could be raised to 12.6 g/dl for the day of surgery by substituting iron-II-glycin-sulfate (100 mg/d). Additionally, blood sampling was reduced to a minimum, and the surgical procedure was thoroughly and interdisciplinarily planned. Alongside with cell savage techniques, anesthetic management focused on the third pillar of PBM, aiming for cardiopulmonary optimization by using a machine learning monitoring tool and a hemodynamic goal-directed therapy (GDT) protocol. The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) was established by Edwards Lifesciences (Irvine, California, USA) and is certified in the United States and Europe for hemodynamic monitoring. It aims to predict phases of intraoperative hypotension (IOH, defined as MAP < 65 mmHg for at least one minute) up to 15 min before their onset. The scale ranges from 0 to 100%, indicating the likelihood of and remaining time to pending IOH. Our hypothesis was that unnecessary volume expansion could be avoided by using the HPI-based GDT because additional fluids would only be given when the patient would be volume responsive and simultaneously be at risk for IOH. This approach should therefore prevent unnecessary hemodilution. Induction of anesthesia, hemodynamic, and intraoperative management The patient received a standard induction of anesthesia using sufentanil (0.52 \u03bcg/kg), propofol (1.67 mg/kg), and cis-Atracurium (0.21 mg/kg). The maintenance of anesthesia was performed as total intravenous anesthesia using propofol (6\u201312 mg/kg/h) as continuous infusion and sufentanil (0.1\u20130.3 \u03bcg/kg) as intermittent bolus injection. The total duration of surgery was 425 min. To compensate for blood loss, a mechanical autotransfusion system (CellSaver\u00ae, Haemonetics Corporation, Boston, USA) was used during the whole course of surgery. For hemodynamic management, an HPI-based GDT-algorithm was used . Since unnecessary hemodilution, also in GDT-treated patients, would lead to an unfavorable outcome, especially in the presented patient, we chose a more fluid-restrictive GDT. First, before the induction of anesthesia, the baseline cardiac index (CI) as well as the stroke volume were determined by implementing an arterial line in the awake patient. If HPI was raised over 70%, hemodynamic intervention was performed according to the algorithm. More specifically, if stroke volume variation (SVV) increased over 14%, a colloid bolus injection using 100 ml of gelatin infusion (Gelafundine\u00ae, B. Braun Germany) was applied over 5 min. If HPI did not decrease, the injection was repeated until HPI declined < 80% or SVV < 14%, whichever occurred first. If HPI persistently leveled > 80% despite a successful fluid challenge (defined as SVV < 14%), CI was raised when it was below the baseline value with dobutamine (5 \u03bcg/kg/min, half dose if heart rate was raised > 100 bpm). If still no reduction of HPI could be achieved after successful fluid challenge and CI optimization, noradrenaline or theodrenaline/cafedrine (Akrinor\u00ae) was used to maintain a MAP > 70 mmHg. Fig. 1 Hypotension Prediction Index-based hemodynamic treatment algorithm. CI: Cardiac Index; HPI: Hypotension Prediction Index; MAP: Mean Arterial Pressure; SVV: Stroke Volume Variation Full size image By adhering to the GDT algorithm, a sufficient hemodynamic stability was achieved throughout the surgery. The patient received a total of 2500 ml colloid infusion, maximum rates of 0.13 \u00b5g/kg/min of noradrenaline, 0.5 ml of theodrenaline/cafedrine, and no further cardiac support medication. The patient never showed signs of low pH or negative BE despite a blood loss of 2.4 L (). It was possible to reinfuse 1007 ml of the patient\u2019s own blood that was saved by the autotransfusion system. To prevent hypofibrinolytic bleeding, tranexamic acid was infused intraoperatively, starting with a bolus of 20 mg/kg/h for 1 hour and continuing with an infusion of 4 mg/kg/h for the remaining time of surgery. Once bleeding started to intensify, point-of-care thrombelastography (ROTEM\u00ae, TEM Innovations, Munich, Germany) was used to detect coagulatory alterations, which resulted in the substitution of 3 g fibrinogen.

Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) showed a left unilocular ovarian cystic mass, measuring 60 mm, containing a solid component on the cul-de-sac of Douglas . The patient was referred to the Department of Gynecology, Nara Medical University Hospital in September 2020 for the diagnosis of ovarian tumor. The patient was a housewife with normal social, emotional, and cognitive development and had normal environmental and employment history. There was no past medical, surgical, and medication history. She had never smoked or consumed alcohol. Neurological examinations were unremarkable. Evaluation of the patient\u2019s family history revealed that her father died of lung cancer, all three of her paternal uncles succumbed to colon cancer, two paternal aunts died of gastric cancer and colon cancer, respectively, and one maternal uncle was treated for leukemia. In addition, her paternal grandfather died of gastric cancer. All three of her brothers are fine. Vital signs on admission showed a body temperature of 36.3 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 132/74 mm\u200aHg, and respiratory rate of 20/minute. She was obese (weight\u200979 kg, height\u2009158 cm, body mass index\u200931.6 kg/m\u00b2). A pelvic mass was palpated on the left side of the uterus during physical examination. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 57\u2009\u00d7\u200941\u2009\u00d7\u200939 mm cystic mass with solid component originating in the left adnexa. The cystic part is of liquid signal, the solid component had high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and had low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), with hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) . In addition, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan revealed increased FDG uptake in solid components of the tumor [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax): 19.9] . No distant metastases were detected with staging CT and FDG-PET/CT. The patient had elevated serum levels of cancer antigen (CA) 125 (89 U/mL), but CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within the normal range. Imaging studies suspected ovarian malignancy, and she received primary debulking surgery. Following surgery, the pathological evaluation revealed the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIB. The patient underwent complete cytoreductive surgery. On postoperative day 27, the patient received the first cycle of combination chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel (175 mg/m\u00b2; 3-hour infusion) and carboplatin (at a dose corresponding to an area under the curve of 5 mg/mL/minute). The patient subsequently received five cycles of standard carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Genetic analysis of peripheral blood DNA revealed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations were absent, but tissue samples from a pretreatment tumor biopsy were positive for the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test (Myriad Genetics, Inc.). The patient received oral niraparib maintenance therapy at a bolus of 200 mg daily after first-line chemotherapy. Figure 4 and  show the laboratory data. Her RBC count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count were 297\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 10.5 g/dL, 35\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b2/\u03bcL, and 21.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, respectively, when she started niraparib therapy. Immediately after the start of niraparib treatment (that is, 6 months after surgery), sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) was orally administered to treat anemia. Forty days after the start of niraparib therapy, peripheral blood cell counts, hematocrit levels, platelet counts, white blood cell count, and neutrophil count decreased to 231\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 7.8 g/dL, 9.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 18\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b2/\u03bcL, and 323/\u03bcL, respectively (). Niraparib therapy was discontinued, but hemoglobin levels were further reduced to 7.0 g/dL. The patient had transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Blood examination showed macrocytic anemia [mean corpuscular volume, 99.1 fL (82\u201398 fL); mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 33.8 pg (26\u201332 pg/mL); and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 35.1 g/dL (31\u201334 g/dL)]. Furthermore, blood tests showed high serum ferritin levels 350 ng/mL (10\u2013148 ng/mL) and reticulocyte 3.5% (0.5\u20132.0%), low serum total iron-binding capacity 260 \u03bcg/dL (263\u2013457 \u03bcg/dL), and serum levels of iron 141 \u03bcg/dL (32\u2013170 \u03bcg/dL), bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL (0.4\u20131.5 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase 190 U/L (120\u2013225 U/L), folic acid 8.0 ng/mL (2.1\u201310.1 ng/mL), vitamin B12 401 pg/mL (180\u2013914 pg/mL), and transferrin 211 mg/dL (190\u2013320 mg/dL) were in the normal range. Chest radiography, electrocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound, and thorax, abdominal, and pelvic computerized tomography were normal. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with niraparib-related anemia. Niraparib therapy was discontinued for 2 weeks, and two units of packed RBC were transfused. Thereafter, the patient resumed oral niraparib therapy at a bolus of 100 mg daily and then increased to 200 mg 2 weeks later, but immediately exhibited grade 3 anemia. The patients required two units of packed RBC transfusions twice to maintain serum hemoglobin levels above 10 g/dL. RBC transfusions, dose interruption, and dose reduction were used to manage grade 3 anemia. SFC was discontinued and changed to oral FCH after blood transfusion. She began taking oral FCH at a dose of 500 mg daily 10 months after her surgery. Niraparib therapy was maintained at a daily dose of 100 mg until the following month. After continuous administration of FCH, the peripheral blood cell counts recovered gradually with stable Hb counts fluctuating between 10.7 and 12.5 g/dL. One year after surgery, niraparib therapy is still maintained at a daily dose of 200 mg. Oral administration of FCH was discontinued because the hemoglobin level exceeded 12 g/dL. Then, the serum hemoglobin levels decreased again. However, our patient no longer required blood transfusions and Hb levels stabilized at around 10\u201311 g/dL. She resumed oral FCH therapy after 8 weeks of pause, showing efficacy again. The follow-up is ongoing, and she has never been transfused.  presents laboratory findings in this patient before and after treatment with FCH. She has survived disease-free for 25 months after initial surgery. There is no sign of radiological recurrence with a normal serum CA125 level until now. She reached a total dose of approximately 90,000 mg and 135,000 mg of niraparib and FCH, respectively. We obtained the patient\u2019s informed consent to publish this case report.",

Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion measuring 40 mm in diameter along with moderate right pleural effusion . Fig. 1 Computed tomography scan showing very large pericardial effusion and possibly reflecting the presence of cardiac tamponade. There is moderate right posterior pleural effusion Full size image There was a spiculated anterior subpleural lesion measuring 28 mm extending to the anterolateral pleural surface of the right upper lobe  and significant enlargement of the mediastinal with right paratracheal lymph node measuring 15 mm and subcarinal lymph node measuring 18 mm and left axillary lymph nodes measuring 12.5 mm. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis was carried out. Fig. 2 Computed tomography scan showing right upper lobe speculated anterior subpleural lesion extending on the anterolateral pleural surface, suggesting primary bronchial cancer Full size image The pericardial and pleural fluid cytology contained small numbers of malignant cells, presenting predominately singly in a bloodstained background. These cells have enlarged pleomorphic nuclei with granular to coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive staining of tumor cells for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), napsin A, and Cytokeratin 7 (CK7). Staining for Estrogen receptor (ER), Cytokeratin 20 (CK20), Caudal Type Homeobox 2 (CDX2), and calretinin were all negative. These findings are in support of adenocarcinoma of lung origin. In 2015, the fluid sample sent was not sufficient to undergo further testing to determine PD-L1 expression, immunohistochemistry testing for c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) / anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation, or molecular testing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). She had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 after VATS pleurodesis. The patient quit smoking at the time of diagnosis. She was then commenced on first-line chemotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 5), and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) 3 weekly at T = 1 month in February 2015. She completed four cycles with no dose reduction. Follow-up CT imaging was done 3 months later (T = 4 months) demonstrated good clinical and radiological response. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 [10], complete response was achieved with disappearance of the pleural based right upper lobe lesion. There is complete response to the mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph nodes. She was clinically well with maintenance of her performance status. Given the excellent response after first-line chemotherapy, she was then commenced on maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 every 21 days. This is based on evidence that it prolongs overall survival and progression-free survival [11]. The patient completed eight cycles of pemetrexed without significant toxicities. In December 2015, there was single lesion progression with a new right upper lobe lesion (18 \u00d7 15 mm2) . The patient declined biopsy of this lesion. Given disease progression as per RECIST version 1.1, she was commenced on nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks at around T = 12 months in February 2016 owing to emerging evidence of immunotherapy in this setting for previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Fig. 3 Computed tomography scan showing a right upper lobe lung lesion Full size image After the commencement of immunotherapy, her follow-up scan done in May 2016 showed complete response of single lung lesion as per RECIST version 1.1. Further imaging subsequently every 3 months with CT of brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis continues to show no evidence of recurrence or new metastatic disease. At T = 59 months in November 2019, she had an elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis secondary to multiple cholelithiases. Her nivolumab was not withheld during the surgery, and she did not develop any complications during the perioperative period. At T = 63 months in March 2020, somatic gene mutation analysis was requested on her previous pericardial fluid and tissue sample done early in the diagnosis as the patient was not keen for rebiopsy. Reanalysis of the sample could be done using molecular testing. A mutation was detected in the KRAS gene p.(Gly12Cys): G12C (16%). No clinically relevant mutation was found in the tested regions of EGFR, BRAF, MET, RET, or ERBB2. It was negative for rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 genes. There was high level PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 80%. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan at T = 83 months in November 2021 showed no suspicious fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake within lungs.

The surgery was performed through a small para coronal burr hole on the right side of the skull. Insertion of the endoscopic trocar identified clear CSF that appeared to be under pressure. Very quickly, the cyst jumped towards our lens due to the high intracystic pressure. This high pressure seemed to have been compensated by the back pressure of the CSF. The fenestration was done very quickly. The cyst fluid seemed very clear and under pressure. With the bipolar probe, we removed a large part of the wall.

Computerized tomographic angiography from the arch of the aorta to the lower limbs confirmed the examination findings, demonstrating patent right posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, and a right anterior tibial artery that occluded distally with no flow into the dorsalis pedis artery . The right foot vascular arch was preserved, with the main inflow being via the posterior tibial artery. There was no large vessel occlusion proximally in the thigh, and no aortoiliac abnormalities. Given the chronicity of the symptoms and investigation findings, his right foot pain was attributed to alcohol-related neuropathy and the patient was discharged from hospital with lifestyle modifying advice. Subsequently, he had presented to the emergency department on several occasions over the following few days with the same complaint. Two consecutive blood investigations including total leukocyte counts, neutrophil percentage, and hemoglobin levels were within normal values, while platelet counts on both occasions were marginally elevated at 549 \u00d7 10^9/L and 440 \u00d7 10^9/L, respectively. Furthermore, blood coagulation profiles, which included activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratios were within normal limits on both occasions. With similar examination findings to his previous admissions and normal biochemical markers, he was again discharged with analgesic medication. A week later, he was brought into the emergency department with acute confusion, bilateral foot pain, hyponatremia, and elevated inflammatory markers. This time his total leukocyte count was elevated at 18 \u00d7 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration was 119 g/L, platelet count was 350 \u00d7 10^9/L, and the hematocrit assay was 0.35/L, which remained unchanged from hematocrit values at previous visits. Likewise, coagulation profiles remained normal. A septic workup, which included a lumbar puncture, did not reveal an obvious infective cause. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were unremarkable. Lower limb venous Doppler assessment was negative for deep venous thromboses. His hyponatremia was appropriately corrected with fluid restriction resulting in resolution of confusion. However, on this occasion, he complained of worsening pain in both feet with a rapid onset of new livedo reticularis of both feet. At presentation, the working diagnosis was of a cardioembolic phenomenon in the context of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and he was commenced on therapeutic anticoagulation. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram did not show an intramural thrombus or a patent foramen ovale.

Note normal arteriogram of the left leg Full size image The following day, the patient\u2019s condition and limb pain worsened; he had \u201ctrash feet\u201d and new motor dysfunction of the feet. Overnight, his lower limb ischemia had worsened rapidly to the point where revascularization was no longer a viable option. A repeat CT-angiogram of the lower limbs showed absent arterial flow of contrast bilaterally below the mid-leg, with no evidence of aortic or large vessel pathology . He was deemed to have non-salvageable Rutherford Grade 3 acute limb ischemia in bilateral lower limbs below the knees. To avoid the complication of multiorgan failure that may have resulted from release of myoglobin, intramuscular potassium, and inflammatory cytokines, he underwent emergent bilateral above-knee amputations, with satisfactory improvement in his clinical status.

The red lines indicate the point of angiographic \u201ccut-off\u201d of leg blood supply Full size image A cause for his trash feet was not found prior to the operation that was empirically attributed to cardioembolic pathology. However, the indicator to search for another diagnosis of acute bilateral arterial occlusion of his leg arteries was a positive direct antiglobulin test that indicated the presence of cold agglutinins in his blood. This was performed during blood grouping before major surgical intervention. These findings led to further serological testing, including serum immunofixation electrophoresis. This indicated the presence of a monoclonal B cell population involving 32% of his total lymphocyte count, as well as a mixed IgM Kappa and IgM Lambda cryoglobulinemia, an indication for bone marrow assessment.",

    "original_case": "A 16-year-old Hispanic male was booked into a county juvenile detention and rehabilitation facility. Upon arrival at the facility and during the medical screening, he complained of persistent intractable epigastric pain, along with pleuritic chest pain with multiple episodes of vomiting over the previous 4 days. He further complained of dysphagia and odynophagia. At the time, he denied any past medical history and/or swallowing any foreign body. He admitted to smoking marijuana on a daily basis. During the initial care, he was given ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg tablets and 30 mg of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium solution as well as two hydroxide/simethicone tablets orally. The patient subsequently became more subjectively comfortable, but the chest pain continued to persist. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was done during the same period and was evaluated by the on-call physician as being suspicious for acute pericarditis .\n\nOn the basis of the assessment by the on-call physician, he was transferred to a local emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. In the first ED, physical examination indicated a normotensive, mildly tachycardic patient with moderate epigastric pain and otherwise normal physical examination. He admitted that his vomiting has improved but he still continues to have dysphagia. The patient underwent a series of laboratory tests that included complete blood count, serological liver function tests, a complete serum chemistry panel, and a computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. The initial laboratory findings were significant for a mild leukocytosis, and the CT revealed pericholecystic fluid, distal esophageal edema, and dilation with questionable air in the esophageal wall, and possible hiatal hernia .\n\nThe repeated EKG in the ED confirmed the possible diagnosis of pericarditis as well as concern for possible cholecystitis. Subsequently, the patient was transferred for a higher level of care to a regional medical center for further evaluation. During the course of care at the new ED, the patient continued to present with tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and persistent epigastric and chest pain. The patient\u2019s EKG continued to show diffuse ST elevation, while his cardiac markers remained within normal limits. Chest X-ray revealed a questionable infiltrate. Formal right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and showed gallbladder wall thickening near the fundus of unclear etiology but no gallstones and was otherwise normal. His laboratory results were significant for white blood cells 12.5 \u00d7 10^9 per liter, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 millimeters per hour, C-reactive protein 21.77 milligrams per decilitre, and procalcitonin 11.02 nanograms per milliliter, all elevated. Troponin and the remainder of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were grossly unremarkable.\n\nThe patient was treated with 2 liter of normal saline intravenously and 4 mg Zofran intravenously. Pain medication of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg orally as well as famotidine (Pepcid) 20 mg orally and gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail (aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/lidocaine) 30 ml orally were given. Additionally, the patient was given ceftazidime 1 g intravenously and azithromycin 500 mg orally. While in the ED, he continued to deny swallowing a foreign body or ingesting chemicals that may have caused his symptoms. Upon further review of the patient\u2019s symptoms, imaging studies, laboratory results, and recommendation by the surgery team, the patient was transferred to a nearby pediatric subspecialty hospital for further evaluation by pediatric surgery and gastroenterology and possible endoscopic evaluation of his esophagus.\n\nOn arrival to the pediatric subspecialty hospital, he continued to be tachycardic, but afebrile. In the ED, he received 4.5 gram (g) piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), 20 mg Pepcid, and 4 mg Zofran, all intravenously. He immediately underwent an esophagram with water-soluble contrast that revealed a filling defect in the distal esophagus. After further questioning by the pediatric surgery team, he admitted that he had swallowed \u201ca bag\u201d prior to his arrest but would not disclose the contents of the bag. Subsequently, he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and a plastic bag was discovered in the distal esophagus and removed .\n\nPatient was hospitalized with antibiotic therapy with intravenous Zosyn 3.375 g every 8 hours for suspected aspiration pneumonia and transitioned to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) 875 mg tablets on the third day post-procedure for an additional 7 days of treatment. The patient also continued on 20 mg oral Pepcid twice a day. Further evaluation by pediatric cardiology and repeated EKG confirmed the diagnosis of pericarditis, likely post-infectious in etiology. His esophagus also showed evidence of achalasia, which was attributed to the prolonged irritation of the epithelial surface and the inflammation in the surrounding region.\n\nWhile awaiting for the outpatient follow-up, 7 days after discharge, he returned to the local ED with persistent left-sided chest pain and dyspnea worsened with exertions and wheezing. The patient was noted to have significant leukocytosis, and a CT of his chest revealed a left-sided loculated hydropneumothorax with central cavitary lesion. He was then transferred back to the pediatric surgery service at the same subspecialty hospital for further evaluation. Given concern for esophageal perforation, a repeat esophagram was performed showing normal esophageal caliber and contour without extravasation of contrast. The patient was then admitted to pediatric service with placement of a thoracostomy tube by the interventional radiology service. He received 4 days of thrombolytic therapy via the thoracostomy with satisfactory output. The thoracostomy tube was removed 10 days later. Infectious disease was also consulted and agreed with an antibiotic regimen of intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin during his course in the hospital.",

The patient had undergone appendectomy and left inguinal hernia surgery 50 and 10 years ago, respectively. The patient has been receiving oral treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and hypertension for 5 years. At first visit, the patient\u2019s height and weight was 163 cm and 50 kg, respectively. His blood pressure was 136/80 mmHg, pulse was regular at 62 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C. He had no history of smoking or drinking, and there was nothing significant in his family history. Physical examination revealed that his right testicle was elastic, hard, and enlarged to a size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950 mm^3. No obvious lymphadenopathy on the body surface was palpable, and no gynecomastia was found. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and tumor marker levels (AFP, HCG, and LDH) showed no abnormal findings. Ultrasound findings showed a mosaic shadow inside the right testicle with no abnormal findings in the left testicle. Lung CT showed no evidence of coin lesions or effusion . Contrast-enhanced CT showed an enlarged para-aortic lymph node (18\u2009\u00d7\u200916 and 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910 mm^2) , and a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200945 mm^3 mass with uneven contents was found in the right testicle . No evidence of distant metastasis was found during the other diagnostic procedures. Fig. 1 Lung CT showed no evidence of any coin lesions (A). Contrast-enhanced CT showed enlargements of the para-aortic lymph node (B, 18\u2009\u00d7\u200916 mm^2, white arrow), and a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200945 mm^3 mass with uneven contents was found in the right testicle (C, white arrow). The diagnosis was a testicular tumor (cT1, N1, M0, S0, and TNM stage IIA). The resected testicular tumor was 55\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm^3 in size and 63 g in weight. The cut surface was yellowish-white with bleeding and solid, and the testicular tumor was localized in the testicle . Full size image For the right testicular tumor, the TNM classification was cT1, N1, M0, S0, and the clinical stage was IIA [1]. The patient underwent inguinal orchiectomy in September 2020. The resected testicular tumor was 55\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm^3 in size and 63 g in weight. The cut surface was yellowish-white with bleeding and solid, and the testicular tumor was localized in the testicle . Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis, with distinct nucleoli and large nuclei, proliferating in a nest-like manner with some necrosis, and no specific differentiation tendency was observed. Vascular infiltration of tumor cells was also observed. The tumor was poorly differentiated (Fig. 2 A, B). Fig. 2 Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis; the tumor cells have distinct nucleoli and large nuclei; they proliferate in a nest-like manner with some necrosis, and no specific differentiation tendency was observed.

    "original_case": "Case 1  \nA 13-year-old Iranian boy came to our pediatric emergency department, a referral center affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, with the chief complaint of yellowish skin and two red spots on his right leg. Furthermore, his mother mentioned that he had nosebleeds for a week prior to the admission. He developed icterus 2 months before the admission, and after preliminary laboratory evaluations, which revealed elevated liver enzymes, he was diagnosed with hepatitis. One day before admission, his mother suddenly saw some petechiae-like lesions on his right leg, so she brought the boy to our center. We decided to check CBC and performed liver function tests (LFTs). His preadmission medications included folic acid 5 mg once a day and ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice a day. Physicians had prescribed these drugs because of his previous hepatitis diagnosis. On our primary physical examination, his sclera appeared icteric. He had an ulcer on his lower lip. His lungs were clear, and his heart sounds were normal. On abdominal examination, his liver seemed to be slightly enlarged. He also had evidence of ecchymosis on his right leg.  \nLaboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia on the first CBC [white blood cell count (WBC) 900/\u00b5l, hemoglobin (HB) 7.8 g/dl, platelet count (PLT) 4000/\u00b5l]. His liver enzymes were elevated [aspartate transferase (AST) 68 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 174 U/L, total bilirubin 1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.29 mg/dL, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 26 U/L] as they had been over the past 2 months. Intending to find the cause of his hepatitis, we checked for common viral hepatitis causes, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), which were all negative. We checked anti-LKM antibody (Ab), anti-dsDNA Ab, cANCA, and pANCA to rule out the possibility of autoimmune disorders, though we did not find any of them to be positive. We also checked ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels to rule out Wilson\u2019s disease, and neither was in favor of Wilson. We checked coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM, which were both negative. We also asked about his past drug history (including herbal drugs) and any potential toxin exposure, but we did not find that could have caused hepatitis. Moreover, we performed chromosome breakage test, which was negative, ruling out Fanconi anemia.  \nIn terms of his pancytopenia, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The results showed severe hypocellularity (approximately 15%), which was low for his age. Pictures of bone marrow biopsy and aspiration are shown in Fig. 1. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was done on his bone marrow sample, and there was no evidence of leukemia or lymphoma. Our treatment plan was immunosuppressive therapy (IST). The patient was started on equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (40 mg/kg/day for 4 days), prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day), and cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day). After receiving treatment, his CBC stabilized (enough to discharge the patient from hospital with further follow-up scheduled) 10 days after IST initiation, and eventually, he was discharged in good condition.  \nFig. 1  \nHypocellular smear from bone marrow aspiration revealing a few scattered myeloid cells and lymphocytes. On bone marrow biopsy, which revealed hypocellularity for his age, intertrabecular marrow spaces were shown to have been replaced by fatty cells beside the presence of some nucleated cells, including lymphocytes, plasma cells, and erythroid cells  \nFull size image  \nCase 2  \nAn 8-year-old Iranian boy was brought to our emergency department with the chief complaint of yellowish skin and abdominal distension. He was relatively well until 3 weeks prior to admission. His initial symptoms were anorexia, weakness, and fever, which led him to a medical center. Primary laboratory evaluations were done there, and he was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis on the basis of elevated international normalized ratio (INR). He also had extremely high liver enzymes. At that medical center, he had received supportive care. Then, since our hospital is the referral liver transplant center in Iran, his parents brought him to our emergency department. On initial presentation, he was severely icteric. His abdomen was distended, and ascites and hepatomegaly were observed.  \nOur initial laboratory investigations showed severe elevation of his liver enzymes (AST 1615 U/L, ALT 1880 U/L, total bilirubin 47 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 22.8 mg/dL). At that time, he also had coagulation disorder [prothrombin time (PT) 21.1 seconds and INR 2.5]. Moreover, we detected anemia and mild leukopenia in his CBC, but his platelet count was normal (WBC 2900/\u00b5l, HB 8.3 g/dl, PLT 190,000/\u00b5l). We started searching for the cause of his hepatitis. After checking viral and immunological markers, the only noticeable item we found was a positive COVID-19 IgG Ab. Like the previous patient, he did not report any history of exposure to drugs (including herbal drugs) or hepatotoxic toxins. Moreover, Fanconi anemia was ruled out for the patient by negative chromosome breakage test.  \nDuring the admission course, his situation improved and his liver enzymes began to decrease, but he suddenly developed petechiae on his left hand. So, we immediately checked the CBC, which revealed severe pancytopenia (WBC 500/\u00b5l, HB 7.1g/dl, PLT 20,000/\u00b5l). His platelet count dropped drastically. Therefore, we planned for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and the result showed severe hypocellularity, approximately 20%. Pictures of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are shown in Fig. 1.  \nSince his WBC count was very low, we could not consider a bone marrow transplant, and we decided to try immunosuppressive therapy for him, as the other patient had responded well to it. Unfortunately, after receiving the third dose of ATG, he had an episode of generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure, and he did not show any response to the treatment until that time. Hence, we stopped the chemotherapy and transferred him to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) ward. Unfortunately, he was declared brain dead, due to the low platelet number and coagulopathy.

    "original_case": "A 72-year-old Caucasian female patient, with a history of 40 years of smoking without any comorbidities presented with a non-healing, ulcerated lesion on the inner canthus of the left eye at the ophthalmology clinic. Surgical excision of the lesion was carried out in April 2008, with limited excision margins. The histological diagnosis was made. After being asymptomatic for 4 years, the tumor relapsed and the patient underwent a second surgical excision in August 2012. Resection was incomplete, with positive margins, so the patient underwent another surgery to have the tumor removed; however, histological diagnosis once again showed evidence of positive margins. Finally, radiation therapy was chosen as definitive treatment for the patient. Between December 2012 and January 2013, the patient received irradiation in 2-Gy fractions on the left halves of the forehead, glabella, nose, and on the left inner periocular eye regions. The patient attended follow-up examinations by the dermatologist every 6 months. Physical examination of the patient and an MRI scan of the affected area were carried out. The patient remained symptom free until 2018.\n\nIn June 2016, the patient presented with hematuria and was subsequently admitted to the urology clinic for cystoscopy and transurethral resection (TUR). Histological diagnosis confirmed a condition. Following surgery, the patient did not attend regular follow-up at the urology clinic, only at the dermatology clinic. Until 2018 the patient remained symptom-free.\n\nIn February 2018, the patient once again presented with hematuria at the urology clinic. First cystoscopy, then TUR was performed, and the histological diagnosis confirmed a condition, indicating the relapse and progression of the patient\u2019s tumor. Although both radical cystectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy were considered and offered as treatment options, neither was accepted by the patient.\n\nIn the weeks prior to surgery, once when the patient was blowing her nose, a cavity had spontaneously opened between the inner canthus of the patient\u2019s left eye and the medial meatus of the nasal cavity. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the facial skeleton, the cervical soft tissues, and the upper mediastinal regions was carried out in April 2018. The MRI scan showed evidence of the relapse of the condition on the skin of the inner canthus of the left eye, with the tumor invading the ethmoidal air cells in the left regions of the inner canthus and nasal root, as well as spreading into the nasal cavity and frontal sinus, cranially destroying the rhinobasis. For this advanced, locally invasive disease, the patient was given three cycles of treatment as first-line treatment without any adverse events. A follow-up MRI scan of the region, in September 2018, showed disease progression and the increased destruction of the skin in the left inner canthal region. To ascertain the histological type of the tumor, biopsy of the sinuses was carried out, which confirmed the presence of a condition. Based on the decision of the tumor board, the patient was given eight cycles of chemotherapy between January and September 2019. Follow-up MRI showed stable disease. Throughout the treatment, the patient\u2019s functional status remained ECOG 0, and no side effects were noted. Having reached the maximum cumulative dose of the chemotherapeutic agent, treatment with this agent could not be continued. Approval for a therapy was requested by the tumor board but was denied.\n\nTowards the end of her chemotherapy, in the summer, the patient felt a small lump appear in her left inguinal region, so computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in September 2019 at the urology clinic. Although local recurrence of the condition could not be found, lymph node conglomerates could be detected in the aortic and left parailiac regions, and a soft tissue lesion in the left adrenal gland raised the possibility of a condition. Ultrasound core biopsy was performed from the left suprainguinal lymph node conglomerates, with the subsequent histological diagnosis confirming the metastasis of the condition.\n\nIn November 2019, the patient was referred to the National Institute of Oncology for further oncological treatment. Taking into account the recently completed chemotherapy for the patient\u2019s advanced condition as well as the metastasis of the condition, the tumor board recommended the administration of a therapy.\n\nBetween December 2019 and 2020, the patient was given cycles of treatment. Although not a requirement for second-line therapy, staining was carried out for tissue samples from both types of cancer. The sample tested positive for a marker, with a percentage of expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells, while the sample from the lymph node metastasis showed 0%.\n\nThe patient tolerated treatment well; she did not experience any adverse or side effects. Her blood tests were normal, and her performance status remained good (ECOG 0) throughout the treatment. Follow-up abdominal, chest, and pelvis CT scans in both February and June 2020 showed the regression of the lymph node conglomerates, while the lesion in the left adrenal gland remained stable, altogether indicating the regression of the patient\u2019s condition. Response to therapy was evaluated according to the criteria. CT scans of these regions showed evidence of complete remission in September and later on in December 2020 as well. Follow-up MRI scan of the facial skeleton and cervical region in September showed evidence of stable disease.\n\nOn 30 January 2021, the patient presented with symptoms of dehydration and arrhythmia at the emergency department. She was diagnosed with a condition, and was found to be COVID-19 positive. Over the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, she developed bilateral pneumonia, became somnolent and died. The cause of her death was considered to be due to the complications of COVID-19 infection.",

He had a febrile illness with coryzal symptoms for 3 days, which had resolved 2 days prior to this presentation. There was no history of foreign-body aspiration or trauma. He was born to non-consanguineous parents at term and had an uneventful neonatal period. He did not have any previous hospital admissions or recurrent wheezing episodes and was developmentally normal. On examination, the child was afebrile and not pale or cyanosed. His weight was 8.8 kg (between \u22121SD and \u22122SD), and his length was 82 cm (between median and +1SD). He had moderate respiratory distress with subcostal, intercostal, and suprasternal recessions, and his respiratory rate was 50 breaths per minute. He had a loud expiratory grunt. The chest expansion was reduced on the right side, which was dull to percussion. Auscultation revealed a marked reduction of air entry over the lower and mid zones of the right chest; there were no added sounds. His arterial oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a pulse rate of 140 per minute and blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg. The apex was felt at the fifth intercostal space lateral to the midclavicular line, and his heart sounds were normal. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. Urgent chest X-ray performed due to lateralizing physical signs showed a well-demarcated opacity involving the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax associated with a tracheal shift to the opposite side . The right heart and diaphragmatic borders were obliterated. Ultrasound scan of the chest revealed fluid-filled right hemithorax suggesting a septate pleural effusion. His full blood count revealed white cell count of 17,000/mm3 (neutrophils 7300/mm3, lymphocytes 8100/mm3, eosinophils 300/mm3), hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 607,000/mm3. His C-reactive protein was 10.5 mg/L. His serum electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were normal. He was treated for a possible right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic pleural effusion with intravenous cefotaxime 50 mg/kg 8 hourly.

This showed a large multiloculated extrapulmonary cystic lesion involving the right hemithorax with a mediastinal shift towards the left side. This was associated with the displacement of the right-side mediastinal structures, including superior and inferior vena cava, narrowing of the right main pulmonary artery, and compression of the right lung superiorly. The lung parenchyma was normal. The CT appearance was in favor of a benign cystic lesion in the mediastinum. The echocardiography was normal.

Analysis of aspiration fluid revealed clusters of pulmonary macrophages and lymphocytes in the background of blood with necrotic material and no malignant cells. However, the response to aspiration was short-lasting due to re-accumulation of cyst fluid. A week later, he underwent a mini-thoracotomy and surgical excision of the cyst. During surgery, he was intubated with a size 4.5 endotracheal tube and provided pressure-controlled ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure of 18, peak end-expiratory pressure of 6, and respiratory rate of 25.

The cysts can be unilocular or multilocular and are usually benign. However, malignant cysts, such as teratomas, can also occur. The differential diagnosis for a mediastinal cyst includes bronchogenic cysts, esophageal duplication cysts, thymic cysts, and lymphangiomas.

The patient relied on maximum assistance or was dependent on 2+ helpers for all aspects of self-care. For functional mobility, he required a supervisor/touch assistance for bed mobility, and partial to maximum assistance for transfers.  \nThe patient initially presented to the hospital 6 weeks prior for elevated blood glucose levels in the range of 400\u2013500. The patient did not require intubation and did not have any altered mental status during the hospital course. At the time of discharge, his blood glucose was controlled but his wife stated that, upon returning home, they remained elevated in the 400\u2013500 range. Notably, with the patient\u2019s history of anxiety and depression, he had been started on quetiapine 50 mg nightly earlier in the year, which was subsequently changed to olanzapine 7.5 mg prior to this admission.  \nThe patient had another hospital admission 2 weeks prior with 2-day history of involuntary movements in his right upper and lower extremities. He was evaluated with brain CT, MRI, and EEG and was discharged on haloperidol 5 mg twice daily for his symptoms. EEG was negative for epileptic waveforms, while CT and MRI findings were consistent with changes of nonketotic hyperglycemia. During this admission, laboratory values were positive for mild leukocytosis, blood glucose level of 125 mmol/L, and an A1C of 14.6%. Blood workup for secondary causes of hemichorea was unremarkable.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy were completed at home, and a plan was made to continue outpatient physical therapy.  \nFig. 1  \nBrain MRI T1-weighted axial images representing basal ganglia lesions secondary to hyperglycemia.  \nA  \nDiffuse hyperintensity of the left caudate and lentiform nucleus seen in a 44-year-old Hispanic male from case 1.  \nB  \nDiffuse hyperintensity of the right caudate nucleus seen in a 78-year-old Haitian female from case 2.  \nFull size image  \nCase 2  \nA 78-year-old Haitian female with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension was admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit for chorea secondary to new bilateral basal ganglia T1 hyperintensities on MRI, particularly in the right caudate nucleus. She was initially admitted to a level 1 tertiary center with 3-day history of involuntary upper and lower extremity movements that progressively worsened with generalized weakness compromising her ability to grasp utensils and ambulate. There were no associated symptoms of headache, fever, weight or appetite change, loss of consciousness, blurred or double vision, dysphagia, or numbness. Furthermore, there were no recent medication changes. One month prior, she had been admitted for encephalopathy, with hyperglycemia greater than 700 and MRI imaging with diffuse low T2 signal in bilateral basal ganglia .  \nAripiprazole 5 mg twice a day was started and continued during her rehabilitation admission. Glucose levels were tightly controlled and maintained under 200 except for three isolated episodes over her 14-day rehabilitation stay. She was admitted to inpatient rehabilitation to work with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to work on her deficits (). Prior to this, she was independent with ADLs, transfers, and mobility. Both of her physical and occupational therapy evaluations noted choreiform movements while sitting at the edge of the bed and at rest in the bilateral upper extremities that decreased with volitional movement; dystonia was present in static standing in the right lower extremity. Speech therapy noted a mild to moderate dysarthria with reduced speech intelligibility. Choreiform movements, dystonia, cognitive deficits, and dysarthria with reduced speech intelligibility were her main barriers in therapy.  \n Improved functional independence measures from admission to discharge for a 78-year-old Haitian female patient from case 2.  \nFull size table  \nPhysical therapy techniques used for chorea and dystonia included volitional movements (that is, grabbing or holding a cup of water); cognitive distraction, prolonged exhalation, meditation; ambulation and weight bearing; balance in parallel bars; visual feedback using mirrors; gait training with and without an assistive device. Occupational therapy techniques for chorea and dystonia included energy conservation techniques using figure-4 technique; endurance exercises including ergometer; deep vibration with noted reduction in chorea movements; mass practice task consisting of grasping and transferring rings from right to left with hand over hand; functional grasp tasks; visual feedback to increase standing unsupported tolerance in preparation for ADLs participation; Sander box with 3-pound dumbbell using mirror as visual feedback; Nu Step reciprocal stepper for gross motor coordination and activity endurance. Speech therapy techniques for cognitive deficits included targeted cognition and dysarthria as well as compensatory techniques.",

It is noteworthy that the patient reported having chronic lumbar pain for the past 3 months, yet the last few weeks were marked by hyperalgesia without a history of trauma. She complained of night sweating but had no fever, chills, cough, or dyspnea. However, the patient recalled a 1-week history of fever 1 month ago, after taking the second dose of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. She was admitted to the hospital on the same day, and was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases for adequate investigation and management. The patient was known to have hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism\u2014all treated with medications. She also had a history of lumbar L4\u2013L5 disc herniation, for which arthrodesis was performed 4 years ago. She reported a history of unpasteurized dairy product consumption. Owing to the fact that Lebanon is an endemic area for brucellosis, the presence of chronic symptoms with a recent exacerbation shed light on the plausibility of infection with spinal involvement. On physical examination, her temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure 150/80 mmHg, and pulse 105 beats per minute. We noted a painful percussion of the lumbar spine at L3/L4 as well as painful passive mobilization and lumbar paravertebral tenderness. No lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly could be observed. On neurological examination, the range of motion was not decreased for lower extremities; neither sensory deficits nor sphincter abnormalities were present. The performed blood tests were indicative of inflammation: hemoglobin 9.4 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm per hour, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 70 mg/l. White blood cell count was 6410/\u03bcl, and leukocyte formula showed 56% neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes, and 7% monocytes. Blood chemistry was within the normal values. Bacterial serology indicated that anti-antibodies were positive at a titer of 1/5120 (reference range 1/180). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed on 9 July 2021, revealed a multifocal spondylodiscitis involvement of the T12\u2013L1 and L3\u2013L4 discs and their respective adjacent vertebral bodies, with epidural thickening, significant foraminal narrowing at L3\u2013L4 level, and the formation of a paravertebral abscess of 9 mm next to T12. No nerve root compression lesions of the spine were identified. The MRI also showed a grade I anterolisthesis (spondylolisthesis) at L4\u2013L5 (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine used a high field of 1.5 T.

Her medical record included a surgical aortic valve replacement, triple coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and arterial hypertension. The family described her as being completely autonomous at home, as proved by the fact that she worked in her own dry cleaning shop until the age of 88. The exact amount of ingested chemical is still uncertain owing to the high variability of product concentration and the proprietary formulas used by the different brands. However, the patient later described having just a sip before realizing, based on the taste, that it was not water. Around 10 minutes after ingestion she became drowsy and the emergency medical service was activated by her relatives. When she arrived at the emergency room, approximately 50 minutes after the ingestion, her vitals were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, SpO2 96%, respiratory rate of 34 breaths/minute with a snoring breathing, heart rate of 51 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. The first blood-gas analysis did not show relevant abnormalities: pH of 7.38 and lactate 2.4 mmol/L. The poison control center was immediately contacted and promptly provided the available information regarding the chemical toxicity: it is not caustic; it is a fat-soluble product, which tends to accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS); its half-life is extremely variable and uncertain in humans, with an estimated biological half-life of 144 hours; and its immediate life-threatening aspects are CNS and respiratory drive depression, and risk of cardiac arrhythmias, possibly owing to myocardial sensitization to endogenous and exogenous catecholamines. No antidote is available for the chemical. Characteristics of the chemical intoxication are summarized in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overview of chemical characteristics and toxicity Full size image The sudden and deep CNS depression led the whole team to presume that a large quantity of the chemical had been ingested and that its effects on the CNS could presumably last for several days. This scenario would have led to prolonged mechanical ventilation, a long intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and a high risk of ICU-related complications, especially considering the patient\u2019s advanced age. After a team evaluation, the patient was intubated and admitted to the ICU. Intubation was devoid of any complication; however, the patient developed severe hypoxemia, with the need to increase FiO2 up to 1. After 4 hours of mechanical ventilation, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was 70 mmHg with an FiO2 of 0.6 [ratio between partial pressure of oxygen and FiO2 (PaO2:FiO2) of 117]. Oxygenation improved in the following 3\u20134 hours, reaching an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 155 mmHg at FiO2 of 0.6 (PaO2:FiO2 of 258). The patient showed some hemodynamic instability and required fluid resuscitation with 3000 ml of crystalloids infused over the first 4 hours. The concentration of lactate was rapidly normalized and the patient had a normal urinary output. Five hours after the accidental ingestion, two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia occurred, promptly terminated with adenosine. Initially, the patient remained comatose, with a GCS of 3. During the observation in the ICU, her neurological condition started to improve and the patient suddenly woke up and self-extubated herself 12 hours after the ingestion (3 a.m.). Her respiratory function had recovered, she could cough properly and was completely awake. At 8 a.m., her vital signs were as follows: SpO2 98% with 2 L/minute nasal oxygen, respiratory rate of 17 breaths/minute, heart rate of 70 beats/minute despite a brief and self-limiting episode of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 145/50 mmHg, and urinary output 1400 ml from hospital arrival. Less than 24 hours after ingestion she was discharged from the ICU, and 4 days later she was discharged from the hospital. No signs of liver or renal failure appeared, and the only complication during her hospital stay was a single episode of blood in the sputum. A blood and urine sample taken immediately after the discharge from the ICU was sent to the forensic toxicology department of the University of Milano for a quantitative measurement of the chemical. The results were as follows: blood concentration 9.45 ng/ml and urine concentration 25.5 ng/mg.",

    "original_case": "A 1-year old Pakistani origin male child with Down\u2019s syndrome, presented with gradual enlargement of the head, and developmental regression over the last few months. He was born at 38 weeks via vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy to nonconsanguineous parents (mother 33 years old, and father 38 years old). His birth weight was 2.95 kg, length was 52 cm, and head circumference was 35 cm. His Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score was 7 at 1 minute, and 10 at 5 minutes. Down\u2019s syndrome was diagnosed soon after birth, based on typical facial features and presence of palmar crease, and later confirmed karyotypically for Trisomy 21. His two siblings, aged 6 and 4 years, were alive and healthy. Further social and family history was unremarkable. From a growth standpoint, at birth, he was 10th percentile for weight and 25th percentile for length. At both 6 months and 1 year, he was 25th percentile for weight and 50th percentile for length. His head circumference was 50th percentile at birth, at 6 months it was at 97th percentile, and at 1 year when he presented to the clinic, it was 20 standard deviations (SD) above the 99th percentile. From a growth milestone standpoint, at 9 months, he smiled and laughed at \u201cpeek-a-boo,\u201d lifted arms up to be picked up, crawled, and sat up without support. However, at 12 months, his parents noticed that he cried more, stopped responding to his name, and preferred to lay flat rather than crawl or sit. He was also less vocal and less interested in toys. On physical examination, he appeared to have macrocephaly, along with signs of Down\u2019s syndrome including flat nasal bridge, upward slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthic folds, and simian crease. He appeared to be mildly irritable. Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal, genitourinary, and integumentary examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed intact cranial nerves and sensations to noxious touch. However, there was generalized muscular hypotonia with muscle wasting, with \u22122 bilateral knee and ankle reflexes, and bilateral upgoing plantars. His initial blood tests did not show any abnormality. His hemoglobin (Hb) was 11.5 g/dL and white blood count (WBC) was 13 \u00d7 10^9/L with normal differential. His liver and renal functions were within normal limits. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were also within normal limits. Hepatitis B and C serology were negative. Urinalysis and chest X-ray also did not show any abnormality. He was admitted, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a large cystic tumor in the right parieto temporo occipital regions . Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast showed a 10.9 \u00d7 11.4 \u00d7 8.9 cm, heterogeneously enhancing, mixed solid and cystic supratentorial mass, with surrounding vasogenic edema in the right parieto temporo occipital lobe. The solid component was dural based, measuring 6.4 \u00d7 6.0 cm, showing heterogeneous intensity on T2W imaging with marked enhancement on post-contrast images. There was a midline shift towards the left, with compression on the ipsilateral right lateral ventricle. Moderate obstructive hydrocephalus was also noted (Figs. 2, 3).\n\nFig. 1 A, B Pre-operative CT without contrast: Axial images show a mixed density heterogeneously enhancing mass in the Right posterior parieto temporo occipital locations (red arrows) Full size image Fig. 2 Pre-operative MRI without contrast. A\u2013C Axial T2 W/T1W/FLAIR images show a heterogeneous intensity mass (red arrow shows solid component), (red arrowhead shows the cystic component) in the right parieto temporo occipital location compressing ipsilateral lateral ventricle causing a mild midline shift.

Removal of the posterior dural-based solid mass was omitted due its attachment to the highly vascular dura mater. Postoperative course was uneventful. The tumor specimen was sent for histopathological examination, which revealed low cellularity with intervening bands of fibrous tissue and collagen fibers. Neoplastic cells had a high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio with hyperchromatic nuclei. Some areas showed hypercellular pleomorphism, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation. Some cells with rhabdoid morphology were also present with abnormal mitosis . Staining was performed for integrase interactor 1 (INI-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), desmin, creatine kinase (CK), synaptophysin, and Ki-67. INI-1 came out strongly positive, ruling out atypical teratoid and rhabdoid tumors. A large proportion of tumor cells were positive for GFAP  and negative for synaptophysin, desmin, and CK. Ki-67 index was low in the majority of the tumor. However, areas with increased cellularity had raised Ki-67 to 50%. Morphology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis, which correlated with clinical and radiological findings. Further molecular studies were not done.\n\nFig. 4 A Low-power view highlighting collagenized septa with small cell population having high N/C ratio.

A residual mass (3.1 \u00d7 1.3 cm on axial images) was seen adherent to the dura of posterior interhemispheric fissure . The patient was subsequently discharged home. At follow-up at 6 weeks, his mother reported gradual functional improvement, along with recovery of motor milestones evidenced by his ability to sit with support, and return of moderate hand grip.\n\nFig. 6 A, B Postoperative CT without contrast: A major bulk of the tumor had been removed with a small enhancing dural residual mass (2.9 \u00d7 1.3 cm on axial images) adherent to posterior interhemispheric fissure (red arrows).

This mass was adherent to the posterior interhemispheric fissure, as well as the tentorium cerebelli (Figs. 7, 8). Keeping in view this extremely rare presentation with growing residual mass adherent to the dura, prospective treatment options were discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board. With recurrence after the initial surgery, the parents were nonconsenting for further surgical intervention, and chose chemotherapy in the hope of controlling further tumor growth and halting subsequent functional decline.\n\nFig. 7 Two months postoperative MRI without contrast.

On examination, the patient achieved the maximum Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score with no focal neurological deficit. This patient presented to a district hospital in October 2018 with a terrible headache. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed cerebellar hemorrhage with perilesional edema . The bleeding was located at the cerebellar vermis and caused a mass effect on the fourth ventricle and bilateral cerebellar peduncle.

In the day prior to presentation, she exhibited disorganized speech and delusions that her mother was going to die. In the emergency department, she was overinclusive and talking nonsensically. She was paranoid of security staff, endorsed auditory hallucinations, believed she was at a \u201cs\u00e9ance,\u201d and appeared to be responding to internal stimuli. Consequently, she was admitted to psychiatry for further workup and management. Of note, an emergency physician noted organized speech when she was initially seen, though this was not observed by the psychiatry team.\n\nHer thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at the time of admission was 123.90 mIU/L (reference range 0.20\u20134.00 mIU/L). Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood glucose, and creatinine were all normal. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swab was negative. The patient was on no medications prior to admission and had no history of hypothyroidism or other medical conditions. She had previously been prescribed stimulant medications for ADHD but had not taken any stimulants for months owing to previous intolerance. She denied any substance use, including alcohol and nicotine, leading to her presentation, and urine toxicology screen was negative for amphetamines or other substances.\n\nThe patient was living alone in an apartment prior to being brought to hospital. She had a boyfriend and no children. She was unemployed at the time of admission but was to start a new job working with immigrants. Her mother had a history of hypothyroidism, and the patient was not sure if she had any other family history of thyroid or autoimmune disorders. No family history of other conditions was identified.\n\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms fluctuated when she was seen the day following admission. She initially was more organized and was able to describe experiencing persecutory and religious delusions in the week prior to admission. Nonetheless, she continued to experience delusional beliefs that her mother was going to die. Later in the day, she was noted to be more tangential and was unable to answer questions.\n\nWhen seen by the endocrinology consult team, the patient reported experiencing cold intolerance, fatigue, dry skin, poor appetite, and hair loss. She did not notice any weight gain. She reported feeling her voice was weaker and that she felt like she had a frog in her throat. The patient reported that she had previously been diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis but that this had not been felt to be sufficiently severe to require treatment at that time. While documentation from a previous assessment is unavailable, the patient was noted to have an elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase result (67.1 kIU/L, reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L) approximately 5 years prior, with TSH within normal limits, and this may have been why she had been evaluated as not requiring treatment. On physical examination, she had a slightly enlarged thyroid gland, hyperreflexia, and mild tremor. Notably, delayed relaxation or diminished deep tendon reflexes are typically observed in previous case reports, and it is unclear why hyperreflexia and mild tremor were observed on physical examination in this case. It is possible that this finding was erroneous; however, further description of findings in cases may provide more clarity. Cardiac examination was unremarkable, and no nail changes were observed. Additional blood work showed decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) of 0.9 nmol/L (reference range 1.1\u20132.8 nmol/L), free T3 of 2.8 pmol/L (reference range 3.5\u20136.5 pmol/L), and free thyroxine (T4) of 4.6 pmol/L (reference range 10.0\u201325.0 pmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies were elevated at 147.6 kIU/L (reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L). Anti-thyroglobulin antibody and thyroglobulin levels were within normal limits.

Endoscopy and endorectal echography confirmed the clinical suspicion of a severe proctitis . Upon admission, platelet count was already very low (30 \u00d7 10^9), and for this reason no antithrombotic prophylaxis was given. Local anti-inflammatory treatment was prescribed. Three days later, her clinical condition deteriorated, with the patient appearing confused without focal neurological deficits. \n\nFig. 1 Colonoscopy showing severe proctitis with ulceration of the mucosa Full size image\n\nBlood tests revealed acute kidney injury [AKI stage 2 according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), creatinine 251 \u03bcmol/L], severe thrombocytopenia (10 \u00d7 10^9/L), and hemolytic anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 71 g/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 8618 U/L, negative Coombs test, schistocytes in blood smear; Fig. 2]. The clinical presentation was consistent with TMA. Since thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) could initially not be excluded, we administered high-dose corticosteroids and started plasmapheresis. As soon as ADAMTS13 levels turned out to be normal, plasmapheresis was stopped, and corticosteroid treatment was rapidly reduced and stopped. Serological screening for autoimmune diseases was negative (antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) screen, and antibodies associated with anti-phospholipid syndrome). Drug-induced HUS was excluded since no drugs were identified known to cause drug-induced TTP. Complement and anti-factor H activity were within normal limits. Imaging, which encompassed cerebral, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, and chest X-ray did not reveal any lesion evocative for neoplasm or alternative explanations for the neurological symptoms. The patient was up to date on breast and uterine cancer screenings, and a full colonoscopy was performed. Microbiological analysis, including viral serologies and repeated blood cultures, was negative. Fecal cultures were positive for Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli. \n\nFig. 2 Blood smear at diagnosis: polychromasia. Schistocytes and microspherocytes, suggestive of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia Full size image\n\nSupportive care was implemented with careful volume management to control AKI, and red blood cell transfusions were required to maintain a hemoglobin level > 80 g/L.

A few days later (day 15 of hospitalization, Fig. 3), we observed a new deterioration of the platelet count (thrombocytes 20 \u00d7 10^9/L) and the patient developed posterior tibial vein thrombosis despite prophylactic doses of heparin.

Her baseline ECG demonstrating sinus rhythm is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nFig. 1\nPatient\u2019s initial rhythm on presentation to the hospital\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nPatient\u2019s baseline electrocardiogram\nFull size image\n\nPast medical history\nShe had a complex medical history including a qualitative platelet dysfunction disorder with multiple deep vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli on apixaban, granulosa cystic ovarian tumor, right nephrectomy for pyelonephritis, chronic pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hypertension. She worked in the pharmaceutical industry and did not consume tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Her medication list included albuterol inhaler, apixaban, cetirizine, cholecalciferol, clonazepam, cyanocobalamin spray, eszoplicone, fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, ivabradine, sertraline, potassium, and magnesium (Additional file 1).\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for a patient with bradycardia is wide. The first determination in a patient with bradycardia is whether it is the result of conduction abnormalities in the sinus node or the atrioventricular (AV) system. In the presented case, the normal PR interval and the absence of dropped beats suggested no AV conduction disease. Sinus bradycardia can be a manifestation of various intrinsic or extrinsic etiologies. Medications that can exacerbate sinus bradycardia include antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and psychoactive drugs.\n\nInvestigations\nGiven the acute presentation, an acquired cause was suspected. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (3.51 \u03bcIU/mL), AM cortisol (13.3 \u03bcg/dL), serum creatinine (1.2 mg/dL), potassium (4.0 mmol/L), and magnesium (1.9 mg/dL) were normal. A recent echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction and no major structural abnormalities. There were no signs of ischemia or heart failure (troponin T < 0.01 ng/mL, N-terminal pro BNP 64 pg/mL) and no evidence of situational syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. After ruling out common intrinsic and extrinsic causes, a potential cause of her bradycardia was identified. Considering drug interactions, we found no agents on her medication list that exacerbate the effects of ivabradine.\n\nManagement\nGiven her symptoms, ivabradine was withheld and she was discharged from the hospital after 2 days of observation in stable condition with discontinuation of ivabradine. Her heart rate upon ambulation was 70 bpm on discharge. Serum specimens were sent to the Toxicology Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for analysis as measurement of ivabradine levels could not be performed at our institution. Ivabradine concentrations at admission, 12 hours and 36 hours post-admission were 42 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 13 ng/mL, respectively. Ivabradine is expected to follow near-linear elimination with a half-life of 6 hours per the manufacturer, while clinical measurements estimate it at 11 hours. With chronic administration at 5 mg twice daily, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) expected is approximately 22 ng/mL 1 hour after oral administration and the mean steady-state plasma concentration is 10 ng/mL . Given the time of the last dose, the serum ivabradine levels should have been undetectable, but instead were twice the expected Cmax.",

    "original_case": "A 40 kg 9-year-old non-Indigenous Australian female was scheduled for an elective removal of a large right anterior deltoid keloid scar. Her medical history was significant for mild asthma. She had no known allergies, no past surgical or anesthetic history, and no significant family medical history, including no previous general anesthetics in either parent. Medications included regular inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol, with intermittent inhaled salbutamol as required for breakthrough asthma symptoms. She was normally a well and very active child. In the days leading up to her scheduled procedure, she had an intermittent dry cough with no exercise limitation, dyspnea, or fevers. Her preoperative physical examination demonstrated a mild intermittent wheeze in the right anterior basal lung field that resolved with salbutamol administration. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The decision to proceed with general anesthesia was based on a thorough assessment, consideration of all factors, and shared decision making with the family. Two factors leading to a general, rather than regional, anesthesia technique were the size of the lesion (with possibility of local anesthetic toxicity) and a previous traumatic experience when she had direct infiltration of intralesional corticosteroid previously. The patient received no other premedication and was cooperative with preoxygenation prior to an intravenous induction. She received 50 mg of intravenous propofol and 50 \u03bcg of intravenous fentanyl for induction, and was effectively manually ventilated with a circle system during the apneic period. A first-generation laryngeal mask airway (LMA) device was inserted without difficulty with an initial pressure control mode of ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, oxygen, and air (FiO2 0.50), with continuous monitoring of end-tidal capnography, oxygen saturation, heart, and noninvasive blood pressure. The surgical procedure took 30 minutes in the supine position and was uncomplicated. During the maintenance phase of anesthesia, there were no periods of hemodynamic instability, hypoxia, hypercarbia, muscle rigidity, impaired ventilation, or hyperthermia. There were also no obvious abnormalities seen on continuous cardiac telemetry. On emergence from anesthesia, 100 mg of intravenous propofol was given following cessation of sevoflurane to facilitate removal of her LMA under deep anesthesia. The patient subsequently became very difficult to ventilate with high airway pressures, hypoxia, and poor air movement with reduced chest expansion. As an emergency maneuver, her anesthesia was deepened with a further 100 mg of propofol and ongoing manual ventilation attempted with sevoflurane 8% on high flows of 100% oxygen. As this did not improve her ventilation or oxygenation, 50 mg of intravenous suxamethonium was administered with a rapid improvement in ventilation, oxygenation, and airway pressures. Given the rapidity of the situation, the differentials included laryngospasm or bronchospasm with interventions treating both possibilities. Upon recovery of oxygen saturation, chest auscultation demonstrated widespread wheeze initially, treated with in-line salbutamol, which was titrated to effect. She received approximately 1500 \u03bcg of inhaled salbutamol over a 15-minute period. She was supported with positive pressure mask ventilation until safe emergence from anesthesia, then transferred to the pediatric postoperative care unit. Forty-five minutes later in the recovery bay, once completely awake, the patient described right neck pain and lower back pain that prompted a medical review by the anesthetic team. She had a benign cervical spine and musculoskeletal examination, with no red flags. At this stage, reassurance was provided. Two hours later, in the discharge lounge, nursing staff noted an abnormal gait of the patient as she attempted to mobilize to the toilet. On further questioning, the patient was unable to walk unaided and needed full support to stand. A repeat medical review was requested, whereby she was found to have profound proximal lower limb muscle weakness, left lateral thigh pain, and right medial leg pain. She had reduced knee reflexes bilaterally and a broad-based unsteady gait. Her sensory function, upper limb examination, and cranial nerve examination were completely unremarkable. To exclude salbutamol-induced hypokalemia as a possible cause of acute weakness, a venous blood gas was ordered, revealing a mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mmol/L. Having excluded this as a cause, the working diagnosis was suxamethonium-induced myalgia. She was kept for prolonged observation for 3 hours, until her symptoms improved. On discharge, she was able to mobilize unaided. She was provided with strict return precautions if her symptoms deteriorated. The following day, her proximal muscle weakness had returned to involve all four limbs with associated tenderness. She was brought into the emergency department, needing assistance to mobilize. Urgent blood tests revealed a creatinine kinase (CK) of 22,679 units/L, suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Her renal function, electrolytes, and urinalysis were normal. She was admitted for observation with conservative management and resolution of her CK levels over a 4-day period. She had a gradual return to full muscle strength and function over a period of 4 weeks. An anesthetic alert letter was created, addressed to anesthetic, pediatric, and primary care teams to manage this patient until evidence suggested otherwise as sole rhabdomyolysis may reflect a spectrum of this disorder. Given the age of the patient, a muscle biopsy (gold standard test) to definitely identify susceptibility was not performed. Genetic tests were used as an alternative, and detected the following: Gene: RYR1 Genomic location (hg19): chr19:38979901G>A Variant: c.5632G>A Zygosity: heterozygous Classification: 3c\u2014a genetic variant of uncertain significance (VUS) with low clinical relevance. As is the case with genetic testing, this variant may become clinically significant if other cases are found in the future.",

In January 2018, he received 70 Gy (35 fractions) chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin for laryngeal cancer. In June 2018, the patient underwent total gastrectomy and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) for gastric cancer. In October 2018, total laryngectomy was performed for laryngeal cancer recurrence. There was no postoperative wound issue, oral ingestion was started 1 week after the operation, and the wound progressed uneventfully. Subsequently, gastric cancer recurred in November 2018, and combination therapy with ramucirumab and paclitaxel was initiated. In January 2019 (3 months after the previous surgery), the total laryngectomy skin incision suddenly started to leak saliva without any warning signs, such as redness, abscess formation, or skin ulceration . Although ramucirumab was discontinued because the adverse event was thought to be caused by the drug, the issue continued to increase in size . It was managed with various conservative treatments, for example, antibiotics, discontinuation of oral intake, enteral feeding, and negative pressure wound therapy. In February 2019 (1 month after the development of the issue), it was closed using pectoral major musculocutaneous flap reconstructive surgery. However, shortly after the operation, a new issue appeared at a site different from the previous one. The new issue was again treated with the same conservative approach. This conservative treatment was performed for approximately 7 months repeatedly for new occurrences, and a second pectoral major musculocutaneous flap reconstructive surgery was performed in August 2019 (7 months after the development of the first issue). There was no subsequent relapse, but it took 8 months from the appearance of the first issue to complete closure . For 8 months, he was unable to orally ingest much of anything, nor could he receive chemotherapy for stomach cancer. In this patient, ramucirumab was administered for 2 months before the first surgery for recurrence of gastric cancer, and an issue developed 3 months after the total laryngectomy. The issue was intractable, and complete closure was achieved after 8 months. Anemia, hypoalbuminemia, underweight, and hypothyroidism were detected in the laboratory data ().

In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) also revealed the absence of a 5p15.2 signal (Fig. 1 C, green spot). After discussion, the parents were determined to provide aggressive treatment to the newborn, who might have been refractory to treatment compared with CDH newborns with normal karyotype. Fig. 1.

Full size image At 36 + 6 weeks of gestation, the pregnant woman was admitted with premature rupture of membranes and labor onset. A 1542 g female neonate was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications. Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth were 4 and 6 points (appearance 0 and 1, pulse 1 and 2, grimace 1 and 1, activity 1 and 1, respiration 1 and 1), respectively. Immediately after birth, the baby was intubated with sedation and muscle relaxation according to the standard of care for prenatally diagnosed CDH, and was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The mother was discharged 5 days after delivery without complications. The surgery performed on postnatal day 1 was successful. The evacuated organs were the colon, small intestine, and spleen, and no artificial membranes were needed. The baby was extubated 13 days after birth, but nasal continuous positive airway pressure was required for laryngomalacia. Antenatally suspected AVSD was not detected, but a ventricular septal defect (VSD) was newly found. The patient was transferred to the hospital near her home 42 days after birth, and was discharged without any respiratory support 91 days after birth. At 15 months, the VSD had closed spontaneously, and the infant could not stay sitting up unassisted. The postnatal karyotyping of peripheral blood was confirmed to be 46, XX, del(5)(p14); however, the karyotypes of both parents were normal. Therefore, the deletion of 5p was determined to be de novo. The child also showed the phenotypes associated with developmental impairment.",

The patient reported 10/10 intensity pain. He described his pain as constant, with no specific relieving factors, sharp, located mainly in the left paraumbilical region, and radiating to his left flank. He reported having nausea and three episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis. He stated that his friends gave him crystal meth a day prior to the onset of his symptoms, adding that it was the first time in his life that he had ever taken illicit drugs. He denied fever, chills, cough, chest pain, or shortness of breath. He visited the clinic in our hospital about 5 years ago and was diagnosed with hypertension but was not taking any medications at the time of his emergency department visit. There was no history of any surgeries in the past. He had no history of any allergies to medications or foods. He reported that his father, mother, sister, and brothers were healthy, and all of them lived in Honduras. The patient's social history revealed that he worked as a painter and lived with his wife and kids. He denied smoking and prior illicit drug use. He reported occasionally drinking a few beers. On admission, he had a temperature of 96.9 Fahrenheit, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20/minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appeared to be obese and in significant distress. There was left paraumbilical tenderness along with the guarding but no rebound tenderness. In the emergency room, the patient required multiple doses of intravenous morphine for pain relief. Pertinent laboratory works on admission included: leukocytes 13,900/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 16.3 g/dL, platelet count 720,000/\u03bcL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, lipase 14 U/L, amylase 34 U/L. No significant red cell or platelet abnormalities were noted on the peripheral smear. Urine toxicology was positive for amphetamines and opiates. Urinalysis revealed 1 + ketones, 1 + protein, 3\u20135 red blood cells (RBCs), 0\u20132 white blood cells (WBCs) and was negative for bacteria, leukocyte esterase, and urine nitrite. The patient tested negative for COVID-19. Abdominal ultrasound showed no acute pathology. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed thickening of the left adrenal gland with inflammatory stranding of the surrounding fat and internal hypoenhancement of the gland (Fig. 1 A\u2013C). There was normal density and enhancement of the right adrenal gland. The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit for close monitoring for possible hemorrhage or hypotension. Hematology was consulted in the Emergency Department. Per hematology recommendations, the patient was started on a therapeutic dose of Lovenox (enoxaparin-1 mg/kg twice daily) and transitioned to eliquis (apixaban-5 mg twice daily) the next day. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a normal-sized cavity and normal wall thickness of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 60\u201365%, and normal diastolic function.

    "original_case": "During a summer rainstorm, a 50-year-old Caucasian man riding a bicycle in the forested area around the city of Trieste, Italy, was struck by lightning, resulting in immediate CA, as reported by bystanders. Basic life support was not initiated by the lay bystanders, but was initiated only a few minutes later by a physician hiking nearby and subsequently continued by the medical emergency system personnel who arrived at the scene 15 min after the event. The presenting rhythm was asystole, with a downtime before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of 16 minutes. After ROSC, the patient remained unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3, non-reactive mydriatic pupils, and stable blood pressure and oxygenation values once intubated. During the secondary examination at hospital admission, a cutaneous lesion in the occipital area was noted, described as singed hair with a dominant burning smell, linear in shape, with a small round black eschar, presumably compatible with the first contact with lightning .\n\nThe presence of burnt plastic at the level of the occipital slot of the helmet was consistent with the hypothesis of the eschar being the first contact with lightning. Similar erythematous cutaneous lesions with singed hair were found at the suprapubic level, probably the output area in proximity to the metal core of the bicycle frame through the saddle .\n\nIn addition, the right tympanic membrane was perforated. Ophthalmological assessment was negative. Total body computed tomography (CT) scan showed a modest right apical and temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage, millimeter-sized petechial hemorrhages in the cortical-subcortical junction of the fronto-parietal lobes, and slight signs of initial edema . An abundant hemoperitoneum associated with a bleeding hepatic angioma was present.\n\nThe patient underwent immediate damage control surgery, with abdominal packaging to control the bleeding, and then was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory tests on blood samples revealed elevated biomarkers of myocardial and hepatic injury (high-sensitivity troponin I, 90,879 ng/L; creatine kinase, 1131 U/L; aspartate and alanine transaminases, 361 and 421 U/L, respectively; blood lactate, 11.36 mmol/L). The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with minimal nonspecific ST elevation in the inferior leads, and cardiac ultrasonography showed normokinetic ventricles; no further cardiology investigations were undertaken at that time. Owing to the prolonged time to admission, target controlled temperature management was not established, and the subsequent appearance of fever (from day 2 after ICU admission, mean central body temperature of 38.2 \u00b0C with only one peak at 38.8 \u00b0C) was managed with ice packs, a short period of diclofenac infusion, and then acetaminophen on demand. No prophylactic therapy against vasospasm or brain edema was initiated since serum hyperosmolality was persistently elevated (319 mOsm/L). Following surgery, the patient remained in cardiogenic shock with profound hemodynamic instability and lactic metabolic acidosis. Increasingly higher norepinephrine doses were needed to support arterial pressure, peaking 0.95 mcg/kg/min on day 2. On day 3, after adequate goal-direct volume expansion, terlipressin infusion was added to the treatment regimen (peaking at 1.28 mcg/kg/h). Cardiac function was restored to normal, as demonstrated by a further ultrasound assessment. Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis (noted at admission to the ICU by the elevated levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatine kinase [1131 U]) and oliguria were managed with volume expansion with crystalloids, urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate boluses, and diuretics. A brain CT scan was repeated on day 2, revealing a further reduction of the cortico-subcortical differentiation bilaterally in the frontal-parietal and temporo-occipital areas compatible with anoxic edema, a marked flattening of the cortical convolutions, and the obliteration of the supratentorial peri-encephalic liquor spaces, also at the level of basal cisterns. On day 3, sedation was interrupted to allow for neuroprognostication. A neurological clinical assessment revealed a persisting GCS of 3 and the absence of pupillary and corneal reflexes. Somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated bilateral absence of the cortical somatosensory N20-potential (ERB- and N13-potential were present) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded minimal cerebral electrical activity with very low voltages. On day 4, hemodynamic stability was obtained, allowing for tapering of vasopressor support, and the fever ceased. On day 5, the patient remained unconscious with a GCS of 3 and only a weak cough reflex and respiratory drive. A new EEG revealed an isoelectric trace. A cerebral CT angiography revealed a regular opacification of the arterial circulation with normal venous drainage. Direct scanning highlighted further reduced cortical-subcortical differentiation and marked flattening of brain convolution .\n\nThe patient died on day 10. A post-mortem evaluation revealed signs of multi-organ hypoperfusion, with effects on subendocardial and transmural cardiomyocytes. Cerebral sections confirmed the CT findings of petechiae and subarachnoid hemorrhage previously located along the electrical current and as a result of direct damage to brain vasculature. Brain tissue softening and edema were associated with the direct effects of electrical passage. The cerebral parenchyma sections revealed an abundant, non-selective loss of neurons . We collected detailed medical information from the patient\u2019s relatives, but nothing in his medical history could be related to any previous neurological or cognitive disturbances.",

His adult hemoglobin (HbA2) was > 3%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 74.89 fl, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) was 30.4 pg according to his medical records, and his physical examination revealed that he had knee pain and an enlarged spleen (> 3 cm below costal margin). After reviewing his family history, it was discovered that one of his two male siblings (who died) had a similar condition, while all of his sisters were well . The parents gave their consent for the patient, but the parents and their healthy offspring declined to participate, so we removed them from the study. Medical details and blood samples were collected from the hospital once written informed consent was given. The genomic DNA was isolated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the gDNA Blood Mini Kit (Chromous Biotech, Bengaluru, India). Additional genomic analysis was carried out according to [4]. The BLAST method in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database was used to confirm the identification of the collected sequences. By comparing mutations to reference sequences, direct counting was used to determine their presence (NG 000007.3 Homo sapiens chromosome 11). The dbSNP, Clinvar, Ithanet, and HbVar databases were then used to look for mutations that had been identified in other populations [5]. Fig. 1 Details related to the case study.

Symptoms were preceded by 1 day of headache and fever, prompting evaluation at an urgent care center where she was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. On the morning of presentation, she sought further evaluation in the emergency department for symptom progression to chest pain, heavy breathing, and confusion. Pertinent examination findings at presentation included disorientation, combative behavior without focal neurologic deficit, tachycardia, Kussmaul breathing, dry mucus membranes, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 22.3 \u00d7 10\u00b3/mcL), anion-gap metabolic acidosis (pH 6.92, pCO\u2082 < 5 torr, base deficit 28), and hyperglycemia (glucose 668 mg/dL). Urinalysis was significant for ketonuria and glucosuria. Physical examination and laboratory findings were consistent with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C > 16%) complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), likely triggered by acute COVID-19 infection, with features concerning for cerebral edema. She was started on continuous insulin infusion (0.1 units/kg/h), given a bolus of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS), and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further management. DKA was treated according to the institutional protocol with intravenous fluids, continuous insulin infusion, and close electrolyte monitoring.\n\nDue to persistent alteration in mental status shortly after admission, she received two additional HTS boluses and had head computed tomography (CT) scan, which was normal. Despite these interventions and resolution of metabolic derangements, her mentation remained altered. On day 2 of admission, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward. Additional findings were notable for dehiscence of the planum sphenoidale and involvement of the left nasal cavity near superior turbinate, which was concerning for an infectious cerebritis with possible developing phlegmon/intracranial abscess. In the clinical setting of DKA, these findings were concerning for invasive sinusitis with intracranial extension. Lumbar puncture (LP) was subsequently performed on day 2 and revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and negative meningitis encephalitis panel. CSF cultures were not obtained at that time due to limited sample volume. An infectious diseases specialist was consulted and recommended an empiric antimicrobial regimen with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and liposomal amphotericin B given the risk for invasive fungal disease. The patient did not meet criteria for treatment of acute COVID-19 infection, so steroids and antivirals were deferred.\n\nFig. 1 Head images (CT and MRI). a (Day 2 admission): MRI T1 brain sagittal view showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward through the right gyrus rectus. b (Day 3 admission): sinus CT showed mild opacification of superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive changes of the osseous septa and possible defect. c (Day 4 admission): head CT showed cerebral edema with mass effect suggestive of infectious cerebritis. d (Day 10 admission): MRI Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain coronal view showed significantly increased area of cerebritis/phlegmon involving right frontal lobe extending into the basal ganglia. Interval increased midline shift with extension of vasogenic edema to the left gyrus rectus. e (Day 16 admission): MRI T2 brain horizontal view showed progression of parenchymal involvement involving right frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, and across the corpus callosum to the contralateral side with a 3-mm right-to-left midline shift. f (Day 25 admission, day 15 post ope, 9/29 images): increased mass effect with right-to-left midline shift with interval increased hypodensity involving the right frontotemporal lobes, basal ganglia, and thalamus extending to the right midbrain, representing increased edema or infection.\n\nOn day 3 of admission, sinus CT scan  revealed mild opacification of the superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive change of the osseous septa and possible bone defect. An otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgeon performed an endoscopic nasal examination, notable for friable tissue without evidence of necrosis. Due to limited patient tolerance during the awake examination, biopsies were not obtained at that time. On day 4 of admission, repeat head CT  showed interval progression of intracranial pathology with mass effect and cerebral edema suggestive of infectious cerebritis. Repeat LP was unsuccessful, so blood metagenomics testing (Karius test, Redwood City, CA) was obtained on day 5 to aid in the diagnosis. She continued to have daily fevers despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Blood cultures obtained at initial presentation remained negative, and an evaluation for endocarditis as a potential source of fever was unrevealing. Invasive fungal disease was most concerning among the differential diagnoses, so posaconazole was added to the antimicrobial regimen on day 7 of admission while awaiting results of the Karius test. Results returned on day 9 of admission and revealed genetic material belonging to a fungal organism. The positive Karius test in the setting of progressive intracranial disease confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nVancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole were discontinued, and treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole was continued at that time. Repeat imaging on day 10  showed disease progression with worsening midline shift while on maximal antifungal therapy, prompting the decision to pursue emergent surgical debridement. The patient underwent frontal craniotomy with drainage of abscess and sphenoidotomy with debridement. Intraoperative findings were notable for invasive infection and necrotizing cerebritis . Pathology revealed necrosis with non-septate broad hyphae and scattered giant cells with micro-abscess formation. Posaconazole was discontinued on day 13 due to prolonged QTc interval identified on surveillance electrocardiogram (EKG) and was replaced with isavuconazole. Nasal amphotericin irrigations were performed by ENT as adjunctive therapy.\n\nFig. 2 Endoscopic view of the right nasal cavity.

Microscopic examination of the debridement specimen from right frontal lobe reveals necrotic brain tissue with broad-based ribbon-like pauciseptate hyphae. The angle of branching is wide-angle and greater than other organisms, usually approaching 90\u00b0 (a and b). Angioinvasion is easily identified (c). There is a marked inflammatory response which is neutrophilic and granulomatous between the viable brain tissue and necrosis (d). a (Periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain) and b (Grocott\u2013Gomori methenamine silver stain): Irregular, broad-based, pauciseptate thick fungal hyphae branching at right angles in the necrotic focus (original magnification, \u00d7400). c Angioinvasion or invasion of the vessels by hyphae. d (Hematoxylin\u2013eosin stain): Granulomatous inflammatory response (original magnification, \u00d7400).\n\nThe patient suffered from central diabetes insipidus and neurological deficits including left-sided hemiparesis and persistent fluctuations in mental status. Weekly head imaging was performed for disease surveillance and showed progression of disease despite maximal antifungal therapy. On postoperative day 6 (day 16 of admission), brain MRI  showed extension of intracranial infection to the contralateral hemisphere and brainstem involvement. Given these findings, no further neurosurgical intervention was recommended. Progression of the disease continued, and subsequent imaging  showed worsening midline shift (1.5 cm on postoperative day 15) with evidence of early temporal lobe herniation. Hospital course was additionally complicated by nephrotoxicity, aspiration pneumonia, and venous catheter-associated thrombus formation requiring anticoagulation therapy. Nasal amphotericin irrigations were discontinued on hospital day 20 due to severe nosebleeds during the procedure.\n\nSupportive care was offered for the aforementioned complications, and the patient continued maintenance therapy with liposomal amphotericin B and isavuconazole. Dose adjustments were made to the antifungals due to renal impairment. Despite these challenges, her clinical status steadily improved. She was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility on hospital day 79 for ongoing medical management and intensive therapies to maximize functional status. After 104 days total of inpatient management, the patient was discharged home and transitioned to outpatient care. Amphotericin B was discontinued at time of discharge, and she remains on isavuconazole monotherapy. As of 10 months from initial diagnosis, she continues showing improvement in functional domains as she can fully ambulate and perform activities of daily living with minimal assistance.",

Four patients, all Asian female, aged between 26 and 71 years old, with average age of 49.25 \u00b1 18.38 were included in this study. To protect the privacy of the patients, we hid their real names, visiting department, hospitalization number, bed number, and other related information. Cases 1 and 2 were previously healthy, while cases 3 and 4 were accompanied by hypertension and renal insufficiency. There was no obvious abnormality in their family or psychosocial history, including related genetic information. Investigations on admission showed no history of pancreatic/salivary gland-related diseases or trauma, neoplasms, genital tract diseases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) operation history, or abdominal surgery. In addition, patients were not diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, common drug factors (such as amino salicylic acid, thiopurine, and asparaginase), or megaamylasemia that can cause elevated serum amylase levels. Basic information and clinical data of the four patients are presented in .  \n Clinical data  \nFull size table  \nClinical manifestations  \nCase 1 showed persistent upper abdominal pain and right abdominal tenderness, with no episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or rebound pain following high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL. Case 2 had abdominal distension, persistent epigastric pain, with no other concomitant symptoms, either. Meanwhile, cases 3 and 4 did not show any significant symptoms. The positive physical examination results of the four cases were all related to the primary disease, and the abdominal physical examination showed no apparent abnormality.  \nClinical findings  \nAfter high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL, serum amylase (AMY) levels increased in four patients, peaking at 193.1 to 340.4 U/L. In addition, increases in urine amylase and serum lipase were also observed. Abdominal enhanced CT scan performed after the occurrence of elevated serum amylase levels in case 1 showed sand-like stones in the gallbladder, with a normal shape of pancreas. In cases 2, 3, and 4, abdominal ultrasound performed prior to high-dose mPSL indicated gallbladder sediment-like stones, rough gallbladder wall, and gallbladder stones, respectively. Notably, the CT scans in cases 2, 3, and 4 did not reveal any abnormalities of the pancreas. The AMY fluctuations of the four patients over time are shown in Fig. 1.  \nFig. 1  \nAMY fluctuations of the four cases and the corresponding course of disease. The four cases started to use high-dose mPSL on the 3rd day, 6th day, 8th day, and 9th day of the disease course. AMY elevation was noted on the 19th day, 9th day, 14th day, and 13th day, respectively. AMY peak appeared on day 22, day 17, day 18, and day 34, respectively. Amylase was monitored for five consecutive days in cases 1 and 2 and weekly in cases 3 and 4.  \nFull size image  \nDiagnostic assessment and diagnosis  \nThe above clinical manifestations, physical examinations, and clinical data were to be not very specific for diagnosis. Only cases 1 and 2 experienced epigastric pain, while enhancement CT in case 1 revealed gallstones. We were able to identify elevated serum amylase levels on the basis of the fact that the four patients had different elevations of AMY that exceeded the normal reference values of our hospital system. We speculate about the possibility of elevated serum amylase levels caused by high doses of intravenous GC through the adverse drug response evaluation described below. We considered whether this can be attributed to drug-induced pancreatitis, but imaging did not reveal any pancreatic abnormalities and therefore diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis were not met. The overall prognosis of the four patients is good.  \nInterventions and outcomes  \nCase 1 and 2 underwent fasting. Then, they were given omeprazole to inhibit gastric acid, phloroglucinol as antispasmodic, somatostatin to inhibit pancreatic enzyme secretion, and anti-infection and nutritional support treatment. Two patients were discharged after a significant decrease in AMY levels, and case 3 and 4 were discharged after improvement of the primary disease. At outpatient review, they indicated that mPLS was effective for the primary disease and that, despite the unexpected increase in AMY, subsequent active interventions led to normalization of AMY. Unfortunately, they have not been followed since then.",

In addition, patients were not diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, common drug factors (such as amino salicylic acid, thiopurine, and asparaginase), or megaamylasemia that can cause elevated serum amylase levels. Basic information and clinical data of the four patients are presented in .  \n Clinical data  \nFull size table  \nClinical manifestations  \nCase 1 showed persistent upper abdominal pain and right abdominal tenderness, with no episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or rebound pain following high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL. Case 2 had abdominal distension, persistent epigastric pain, with no other concomitant symptoms, either. Meanwhile, cases 3 and 4 did not show any significant symptoms. The positive physical examination results of the four cases were all related to the primary disease, and the abdominal physical examination showed no apparent abnormality.  \nClinical findings  \nAfter high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL, serum amylase (AMY) levels increased in four patients, peaking at 193.1 to 340.4 U/L. In addition, increases in urine amylase and serum lipase were also observed. Abdominal enhanced CT scan performed after the occurrence of elevated serum amylase levels in case 1 showed sand-like stones in the gallbladder, with a normal shape of pancreas. In cases 2, 3, and 4, abdominal ultrasound performed prior to high-dose mPSL indicated gallbladder sediment-like stones, rough gallbladder wall, and gallbladder stones, respectively. Notably, the CT scans in cases 2, 3, and 4 did not reveal any abnormalities of the pancreas. The AMY fluctuations of the four patients over time are shown in Fig. 1.  \nFig. 1  \nAMY fluctuations of the four cases and the corresponding course of disease. The four cases started to use high-dose mPSL on different days, and AMY elevation and peak values varied across cases. Amylase was monitored at different intervals for each case.  \nFull size image  \nDiagnostic assessment and diagnosis  \nThe above clinical manifestations, physical examinations, and clinical data were not very specific for diagnosis. Only cases 1 and 2 experienced epigastric pain, while enhancement CT in case 1 revealed gallstones. We were able to identify elevated serum amylase levels on the basis that the four patients had different elevations of AMY that exceeded the normal reference values of our hospital system. We speculate about the possibility of elevated serum amylase levels caused by high doses of intravenous GC through the adverse drug response evaluation described below. We considered whether this can be attributed to drug-induced pancreatitis, but imaging did not reveal any pancreatic abnormalities and therefore diagnostic criteria",

The cutaneous nodules had progressed over time and were visible on both legs. The patient had no significant medical history, was a former smoker, used 14 units of alcohol per week, and had done office work. She had not experienced abdominal discomfort or weight loss. Both her parents had died from lung cancer, and there was no further family history of gastrointestinal or pancreatic cancer. She was the mother of three children and used the following medications: allopurinol, metoprolol, omeprazole, perindopril/indapamide, and pravastatin. \n\nPhysical examination revealed three cutaneous nodules ranging in diameter from 1 to 4 cm on both legs . One was slightly red, while the other two were dark red to purple\u2013blue. All were painful during palpation. According to the dermatologist, the skin lesions were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of panniculitis. Further neurological and physical examination was not performed. \n\nFig. 1 Cutaneous nodules on both legs during presentation Full size image \n\nThe skin biopsy obtained showed a predominantly lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis of which the aspect was highly suspicious for pancreatic panniculitis . Based on this finding, further diagnostic analyses were performed including blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scan followed by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and fine-needle biopsy. A lipase serum level of >\u20093000 U/L (normal range <\u200960 U/L) and a mass located between the stomach and the left side of the pancreas, with a diameter of 7.4 cm, was seen . There were no signs of metastases. EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy was obtained, and the histopathological diagnosis was made. \n\nFig. 2 Skin biopsy showing the subcutis with local saponification of fat Full size image \n\nFig. 3 Mass located in the left pancreas, in contact with the stomach Full size image \n\nThe patient was discussed during the pancreatobiliary multidisciplinary team meeting. Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy including splenectomy was advised. Upon hospital admission, pulse, blood pressure, and temperature were normal. The patient underwent this procedure laparoscopically including en bloc wedge resection of the stomach owing to tumor in-growth. Operation time was 7 h. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 4 after an uncomplicated hospital stay. During the hospital stay, she received paracetamol, oxycodone, pheneticillin because of the splenectomy, and magnesium hydroxide. Her renal and liver function were normal. No additional urinalysis or microbiology was performed. The cutaneous nodules on both legs had disappeared 1\u20132 days after surgery. \n\nThe diagnosis on the resection specimen was made, the resection margins were free of tumor (R0 resection), and there were no lymph node metastases found in 12 examined lymph nodes. The postoperative multidisciplinary team meeting advised the patient to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the added value of adjuvant chemotherapy for this rare form of pancreatic carcinoma has not been well researched. Based on the available data, the patient rejected adjuvant chemotherapy. \n\nDuring the first and second outpatient visit, at 4 and 6 months postoperatively, no long-term complications were reported, and the patient had recovered well. One year after surgery, the patient presented to the emergency room with similar symptoms as preoperatively. CT scan showed both local recurrence and distal metastases, which were subsequently confirmed by biopsy. She started with palliative folinic acid\u2013fluorouracil\u2013irinotecan\u2013oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) chemotherapy but stopped after two cycles because of disease progression.

Echocardiography findings were highly suggestive for precapillary pulmonary hypertension: severe right chambers dilation, D-shaped left ventricle, severe tricuspid regurgitation, high velocity of tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary pressure estimated at 100 mmHg, dilated and not collapsing inferior vena cava, and pericardial effusion. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest excluded pulmonary embolism; high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) ruled out parenchymal diseases and mediastinal lymphadenopathy; capillaroscopy documented a scleroderma pattern; antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-centromere antibodies (ACA), and anti-mitochondrial antibodies tested positive; HIV serology tested negative; hepatic echo-Doppler ruled out portopulmonary hypertension. Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was not tested because of severe hypoxemia. Right heart catheterization (RCAT) documented a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 58 mmHg, cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m\u00b2, right atrial pressure (RAP) of 8 mmHg, pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) of 8 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 16 Woods units (WU). Laboratory tests showed a monoclonal spike of IgG-\u03bb. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (34 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (34 U/L) and bilirubin levels (1 mg/dL) tested within normal ranges. N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) tested positive for possible heart failure (4534 ng/L). Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was ruled out as a cause of PAH by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Continuous intravenous treatment with epoprostenol was proposed but refused by the patient, who was therefore treated with a high dose of furosemide before starting a specific oral therapy for PAH. At first, suspecting PVOD, sildenafil 20 mg BID was prescribed and titrated to 20 mg TID over 1 month, without reported adverse effects. After this, macitentan was prescribed at 10 mg OD. After 1 month, a significant increase in AST (485 U/L) and ALT (451 U/L) levels was found on routine analyses. Macitentan therapy was therefore suspended, with a gradual decrease in levels of transaminases. Liver ultrasound and complete viral serology showed no signs of specific diseases. After suspending macitentan administration, the patient\u2019s clinical condition worsened and sildenafil was replaced with tadalafil 20 mg OD, which was then titrated to 40 mg OD. In February 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases, selexipag therapy was introduced with slow titration. After 2 months, at the dose of 800 mcg BID with selexipag, AST and ALT levels were increased (201 and 232 U/L).

She also complained of having bilateral lower limb weakness that started 20 days back. Initially, the patient showed a good response to prokinetic drugs and changes in the diet, but gradually her condition deteriorated. She recorded a 20 kg weight loss. On arrival at our department, the patient was hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, she appeared cachectic and had a burn injury scar on her face. Her abdominal examination and cardiovascular examination were normal. On neurological examination, she was well oriented in time, place, person, and perception. She had decreased tone in bilateral lower limbs with a power of 2/5. She had absent reflexes with downgoing plantars in bilateral lower limbs. Her sensory examination of lower limbs revealed diminished vibratory and proprioception sensations; however, pain, temperature, and touch sensations were intact. The rest of her central nervous system examination was normal. Additionally, an ophthalmologist was taken on board as she had limitations in gaze across all four quadrants consistent with complex ophthalmoplegia. The rest of the ophthalmic examination was normal. Previously, the patient had undergone laboratory workup and imaging studies to investigate her gastrointestinal symptoms. All the investigations done, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen as well as pelvis, duodenal, and jejunal mucosal biopsies, were unremarkable except for upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, which revealed reflux esophagitis. Her stool routine examination was unremarkable. A review of the patient\u2019s past record did not reveal the procedure used to obtain the aforementioned biopsies. Her celiac serology was negative as well. Furthermore, her gastroparesis was confirmed with gastric emptying scintigraphy. Her repeated complete blood profile and smear showed blood hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL with a microcytic and hypochromic picture. The rest of her investigations including basal metabolic panel, hemoglobin A1c, and lipid profile were normal (). Nerve conduction studies (NCS) revealed peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, demyelinating in type with secondary axonal degeneration. Electromyography (EMG) was advised, which revealed myopathic discharges in proximal as well as distal muscle groups, most prominent in lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed extensive lesions suggestive of leukoencephalopathy . On the basis of the classic clinical signs and symptoms observed along with the imaging studies, a specific syndrome was suspected and the patient was advised to undergo genetic testing and blood nucleoside studies. These investigations, however, were not possible. Owing to financial constraints and limited laboratory genetic testing capabilities in our setup, the patient\u2019s plasma thymidine level was not assessed.

She was the fourth child in the family and was born as a result of a full-term, well-controlled pregnancy. No history of drug use or exposure to radiation during pregnancy was reported. Delivery was completed at the Gynecological center at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo, with a birth weight (BW) of 3600 g. Cholecalciferol (D3) for prevention of vitamin D deficiency was administered regularly. She was vaccinated regularly as per national vaccination calendar. She was breastfed for 1 year and a half, and supplementary food was introduced at 6 months of life. Her growth and development were normal. No relevant family history was reported. She was diagnosed with epilepsy 4 years ago. She initially presented with generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, and antiepileptic therapy, valproic acid, was initiated by pediatric neurologist. Despite treatment and compliance with therapy, seizures continued; therefore, a second antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, was introduced, and she continued to be on both antiepileptic drugs and comply with therapy. However, recently, she started to manifest hallucinations, emotional disturbances, and irritability, and the psychiatrist put her on fluoxetine. Later, she experienced cognitive decline, behavioral change, dysarthria, and difficulty walking. At admission, she weighed 40 kg and was disoriented, irritable, and unable to communicate. Physical examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed no erythema or swelling, but difficulty walking independently. Other system examination revealed no pathologic findings. Overall, the results of routine blood tests showed normal values; hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count was 156,000/mm3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein was negative. Furthermore, liver enzymes, urea, and creatinine, as well as acid\u2013base status of the blood, were within normal values. Other investigations, including urinalysis, were negative, too. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses excluded infectious and immune-mediated etiology. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed, and the psychiatrist was consulted. Owing to progressive neurological status deterioration and lack of response to therapy, it was decided to send the child to a more advanced center abroad for genetic testing because of the inability to perform genetic testing in the country. At the same time, axillary skin biopsy was performed and inclusion bodies were detected. The results of genetic testing also confirmed the diagnosis by detecting a mutation on the NHLRC1 gene. Therefore, parental testing to confirm their carrier status was recommended, as well as genetic counseling. By the time the diagnosis was confirmed, the child had almost lost the ability to walk and speak. She could walk with great difficulty with the help of both parents on each side (the rest of the time via wheelchair) and could articulate a few sentences with difficulty. She still remains in this condition (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).",

Lafora disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive myoclonus epilepsy, cognitive decline, and polyneuropathy. It is caused by a mutation in the NHLRC1 gene, which leads to the accumulation of polyglucosan inclusions in various tissues, including the brain and spinal cord. The disease is typically diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, and the symptoms can vary widely between individuals. The most common symptoms are seizures, myoclonus, cognitive decline, and polyneuropathy. Other symptoms may include hallucinations, behavioral changes, and sleep disturbances. The disease progresses rapidly, and most patients become wheelchair-bound within a few years of diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, genetic testing, and brain imaging, which may show characteristic lesions in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Treatment is focused on managing symptoms and may include anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and physical therapy. Prognosis is poor, and most patients die within a decade of diagnosis due to complications such as",

The patient complained of recurrent urethral tract infection UTI accompanied with purulent discharge from urethra and fever. He was also referred to other clinics several times over the years and underwent urethra dilatation owing to bulbar tract stenosis. In his last combined voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and retrograde urethrogram (RUG), stenosis was observed in the proximal bulbar urethra . On main urethral cystoscopy, the mucosa was relatively pale and the opening of the second urethra was not visible in the penile and bulbar urethra. Stricture and paleness of the mucosa was also seen in the proximal bulbar urethra. On flexible cystoscopy, the opening of the second urethra was visible at 12 o\u2019clock and a distance of 3 cm from the verumontanum in the bulbar urethra.

Fig. 1 Patient\u2019s RUG before operation, showing stenosis in the proximal region of the bulbar urethra Full size image The patient was taken to the operation room and underwent general anesthesia in lithotomy position. Then a longitudinal incision was made in the perineal area, and the urethra was dissected from one side. Owing to the stenosis and adhesions caused by previous surgeries, it was released from the dorsal surface and from the corpus cavernosum. The guidewire was then palpated from the dorsal side of the urethra, a plane was taken between the two urethras, and the urethral duplication was dissected from the main urethra. It was removed from the proximal opening of the urethra, and its orifice was repaired with 4\u20130 vicryl suture. The distal urethra in the dorsal region was completely closed, so it was dissected and the double urethra (secondary) was removed with operation. The patient was followed for 1 month after surgery .

At presentation, her vital signs were stable (pulse rate 80 beats/minute, blood pressure: 115/60 mmHg, temperature: 36.9 \u00b0C), and baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 3/10 in both eyes. Anterior segment examination using slit-lamp biomicroscopy was unremarkable, and intraocular pressure was within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination revealed parafoveal telangiectatic vessels with capillary dilatation, as well as barely visible sclerotic vessels temporal to the macula, in both eyes. There was also dense circinate exudation and edema in the macula of the right eye. In the left eye, irregular perifoveal graying discoloration was evident . Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula in the right eye demonstrated aneurysms of various sizes located within inner retinal layers as well as exudation and retinal thickening. Retina in the macular area of the left eye was atrophic with disorganization of retina inner layers (DRIL).

He denied any allergies, history of sexually transmitted infections, smoking, and drinking, and had had no surgeries in the past. He had been administered broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone 2 g) intravenously following the suture, with no improvement. Untreated, such symptoms rapidly destroy the gliding mechanism, causing adhesion formation and giving rise to necrosis. Afterward, the patient began to experience pain and swelling at the injured finger, later over his entire hand and wrist area. The middle finger had blisters and started to blacken (Figs. 1 and 2).\n\nFig. 1 Swelling, blackening, and swelling of the hand, in dorsal and palmar aspect Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Swelling, blackening, and swelling of the hand, in dorsal and palmar aspect Full size image\n\nOn physical examination, the initial wound was nowhere to be found. The middle finger had necrosis and blisters at the level of proximal phalanx of the palmar aspect. There was swelling and redness at both the palmar and dorsal aspect of the hand; the latter had tensed swelling. There were blisters and fusiform swelling at the index, middle, and ring fingers with the position of slight flexion. Passive extension and palpation of the middle finger caused severe pain. Consciousness and vital signs of the patient were within normal limits. No visible edema was found on the forearm. Laboratory studies demonstrated a total leukocyte count of 9100/mm3, C-reactive protein level of < 0.5 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 42 mm per hour, D-dimer of 0.24 \u00b5g/ml, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.30. On radiographic examination, there was no evidence of phalangeal fracture, bony involvement, or foreign body. He was treated empirically with ceftriaxone.\n\nEmergency surgical debridement and fasciotomy were performed. Multiple incisions were made at the dorsal aspect of the hand with two longitudinal incisions over the second and fourth metacarpals and at ulnar and radial sides of the second to fifth fingers, opening the flexor tendon sheath. Minimal purulent discharge was revealed, and cultures for aerobic, anaerobic, acid-fast bacilli, and fungus were taken. The wound was irrigated with saline and left open with a modified shoelace suture for gradual closure (Figs. 3 and 4). Follow-ups were performed daily (1\u201310 days) to assess the wound healing. The smear culture collected from the wound had tested negative. Afterward, the antimicrobial was subsequently changed to meropenem 1 g twice daily. On the 10th day of follow-up, the swelling was decreased. On the 20th day of follow-up, re-debridement and the primary suture were performed to evaluate the wound healing. A clear boundary of necrosis at the level of the middle phalanx of the right middle finger was found; subsequently, disarticulation at the level of the distal phalanx was performed. At the latest follow-up, 1 month after the initial surgery, examination of the affected distal phalanx was within normal limits, and there was no evidence of infection, inflammation, or swelling (Figs. 5 and 6).\n\nFig. 3 Condition after fasciotomy at dorsal aspect and finger Full size image\n\nFig. 4 Condition after fasciotomy at dorsal aspect and finger Full size image\n\nFig. 5 Condition after ray amputation of the middle finger Full size image\n\nFig. 6 Condition after ray amputation of the middle finger Full size image\n\nTo avoid the gap at the middle finger, the patient agreed to perform a ray amputation.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed shift of the descending and sigmoid colon toward the right side with dilation , but there were no significant findings suggestive of the reason for acute abdominal pain. The patient revisited hospital the next day with continuous lower abdominal pain and bloody stool. Vital signs were oxygen saturation 97% under room air, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, pulse 106 beats/minute, blood pressure 173/97 mmHg, and body temperature 37.6 \u00b0C. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension and tenderness. Blood examination showed white blood cell (WBC) 11320/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 3.81 mg/dL, and hemoglobin (Hb) 8.7 g/dL. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.467, pO2 94.2 mmHg, pCO2 34.9 mmHg, HCO3 24.6 mmol/L, base excess (BE) 1.1 mmol/L, and lactate (Lac) 0.7 mmol/L (). Secondary abdominal CT showed strangulation and dilation of the sigmoid colon in the pelvic space, although there was no perceptible free air or ascites . The descending colon was running more to the medial side, similar to in the first CT image . The patient underwent endoscopic reduction with PDM . Endoscopic reduction failed to release the volvulus, however, and emergency surgery was performed.\n\nFig. 1 First abdominal CT shows dilated sigmoid colon on the right side (arrows) and shifted descending colon towards the medial side (arrowheads) (a). Second abdominal CT shows strangulation (arrows) and the oral dilated sigmoid colon (arrowheads) (b).

The patient presented with PDM (d) Full size image  preoperative blood examination and blood gas analysis Full size table\n\nOperative findings The procedure was performed laparoscopically. Dilated sigmoid colon with partial poorly colored region was seen within the pelvic cavity . Strangulation of the sigmoid colon was detected (Fig. 2a, b) and released as soon as possible . The descending colon was running more to the medial side with adherence to small intestinal mesentery , suggesting PDM. The sigmoid colon had shortened mesentery . Detachment of the adhesion between the descending colon and small intestinal mesentery, dissection of the sigmoid colonic mesentery toward the root of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), and identification of the root of the IMA, were by medial approach. There was no Toldt\u2019s fusion fascia at the descending colon, so the abdominal cavity at the lateral side of the descending colon was reached directly . PDM was therefore diagnosed due to abnormality of fixation of the descending colon. Detaching the partial adhesion between the colon and the abdominal wall, we dissected the sigmoid colon while preserving the superior rectal artery (SRA). Elongating the wound site and pulling out the sigmoid colon, we resected the sigmoid colon including the poorly colored segment. The left colonic artery (LCA) was not dissected because there was a possibility of colonic ischemia due to shortened sigmoid mesentery. Colon\u2013colon anastomosis was made by circular stapler. Inserting the drain into the pelvic bottom and washing the abdominal cavity, we finished the operation. The operation time was 182 minutes and the amount of blood loss was 108 mL.\n\nFig. 2 Operative findings revealed dilated sigmoid colon (arrows) and strangulation of the sigmoid colon (arrowheads) (a).

Physical examination revealed a pelvic mass touched on the dorsal side of the uterus. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a 6 \u00d7 5 cm cyst with solid parts on the left side of the uterus. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a multilocular cyst tumor, with solid components and a diameter of 6 cm, in the left ovary, and small-volume ascites. The tumor showed heterogeneity on the T2-weighted image and mostly low signal, but some high signal, which was not fat suppressed in T1-weighted images after fat suppression . Computed tomography (CT) showed no distant metastasis and no obvious abnormal accumulation in the thyroid gland. The patient\u2019s preoperative serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) was elevated to 84.9 U/ml (normal range <35.0), whereas the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC) were within their respective normal ranges.\n\nFig. 1 Magnetic resonance imaging findings.

C In T1 fat-suppressed and contrast imaging, the tumor showed heterogeneous staining in the low-signal part in T1-weighted image.\n\nTotal abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and omentectomy were performed without any residual tumor because the intraoperative rapid histological diagnosis of the left ovarian tumor was suspicious for low-grade malignancy. The postoperative course, as well, was uneventful. Upon gross examination of the surgically resected specimen, the left ovary was whitish with tough elasticity, and the split surface was composed of polycystic formations with a solid area. Histologically, there were two patterns of histological subtypes: papillary carcinoma and poorly differentiated carcinoma . About 70% of the tumor was composed of follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland growing in a papillary fashion, while about 30% of the tumor had poorly differentiated carcinoma. In the area of the papillary carcinoma, the nuclei of the tumor cells were like \u201cground glass\u201d with coffee bean-like grooves . In the other area, full, nodular, and insular structures were observed, and nuclear fission images were confirmed .

The patient had no classical risk factors for the development of opportunistic infection, prominent history of trauma, cosmetic lip tattoo, or burning in her lips. She had taken corticosteroid nasal spray for bronchitis. The clinical examination revealed an ill-demarcated, kissing ulcer associated thick, crusted area with a size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 cm on her lower lip. The ulcer was tender and discharged when pressed . There were no symptoms of interdigital intertrigo involvement nor signs of onychomycosis. The patient was not febrile, and there was no regional lymphadenopathy. The oral mucosa and tongue tissues were normal. Systemic general examinations were not noticeable. The results of screening for human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab), hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) were negative.

The clinical differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, other malignant lesions, ulcerative leishmaniasis, ulcerative mycobacterial infection, erosive lichen planus, immunobullous disorders, and opportunistic fungal infection was considered. Following these clinical manifestations, incisional skin biopsy samples were collected from the lower lip twice. Histopathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, severe acanthosis, spongiosis, and exocytosis of inflammatory cells in the epidermis accompanied by edema in papillary dermis with several inflammatory cells around blood vessels which were nonspecific . Direct immunofluorescence evaluation was negative for immunobullous diseases. The direct smear for leishmaniasis was negative. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test was negative.

Her father had a history of ESRD of unknown etiology and died from a myocardial infarction in his forties. She worked at T Mobile as a salesperson. She had not traveled outside of Illinois, which is where she was born and had lived her whole life. She denied alcohol or tobacco use and her only medication was loratadine as needed for allergic rhinitis. She underwent a renal biopsy and nine out of the twenty sampled glomeruli featured segmental or global scarring. In the non-globally sclerotic glomeruli, the glomerular tufts showed marked visceral epithelial cell proliferation and the glomerulus showed global collapse. Diffuse foot process effacement was present on electron micrography . Work-up for secondary causes was negative. She received oral prednisone and cyclosporine for about 2 years (dose unknown), achieved partial remission (defined as a reduction in proteinuria by 50% or more and stable renal function), and was maintained on oral losartan 100 mg daily.\n\n Patient characteristics at various timepoints of disease course\nFull size table\nFig. 1 a A silver stain showing parietal epithelial cell proliferation and collapse of the glomerular tuft. b An electron micrograph showing diffuse foot process effacement Full size image\n\nAt the age of 27, she presented to the hospital with several weeks of fever, sore throat, chest pain, and body aches. Outpatient testing for influenza, streptococcus, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus was negative. On admission, her temperature was 104.4 F, blood pressure 117/76 mmHg, and heart rate 114 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed a cooperative female in no acute distress, normal conjunctiva, unremarkable oropharynx without pharyngeal erythema, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, sinus tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs, clear lung fields, benign abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, diffuse joint tenderness but no joint swelling, no rash, normal gait, and intact cranial nerves, motor strength, sensation, and reflexes. Laboratory examination was significant for leukocytosis, acute on chronic kidney disease, nephrotic range proteinuria, and mild transaminitis. Serologies showed antinuclear antibodies (ANA) of 1:80, negative dsDNA, normal complement levels, rheumatoid factor (RF) of 60 IU/mL, negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type A (SSA) > 8, and negative anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type B (SSB). Ferritin was > 40,000 ng/mL (). Electrocardiogram (EKG) was noted to have diffuse ST segment elevations , troponin was 2 ng/mL, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild pericardial effusion ; this constellation was consistent with pericarditis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, pelvis (CAP) showed a small left sided pleural effusion . CT of the neck showed enlarged bilateral lymph nodes without evidence of abscess.\n\nFig. 2 Electrocardiogram with diffuse PR segment depression and ST segment elevation consistent with pericarditis Full size image\nFig.3 Transthoracic echocardiogram with mild pericardial effusion Full size image\nFig. 4 Computed tomography chest, abdomen, pelvis with small pleural effusion and atelectasis at left lung base Full size image\n\nAfter no underlying infectious or malignancy causes were identified, a primary rheumatological process was considered. She was given a trial of oral prednisone (60 mg daily), with resolution of fever and leukocytosis and symptomatic improvement. Oral colchicine (0.6 mg daily for 1 month) was added to treat the pericarditis. Repeat renal biopsy re-demonstrated the previous findings and, specifically, absence of SLE features. Her rheumatological presentation was felt to be most consistent with AoSD, given the fevers, arthralgias, leukocytosis, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, elevations in aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT), and the markedly elevated ferritin. Although she had a positive RF, her clinical presentation was not compatible with rheumatoid arthritis. Given her low titer ANA and positive SSA, the possibility of SLE was considered. She was maintained on oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily) and monitored closely in the rheumatology clinic, but over years of follow-up her presentation remained more consistent with AoSD rather than SLE. Additionally, she lacked signs or symptoms to suggest a diagnosis of Sjogren\u2019s disease.\n\nDuring follow-up in the rheumatology clinic, attempts to wean oral prednisone below 10 mg daily were unsuccessful, resulting in flares characterized by fevers, sore throat, facial swelling, arthralgias, myalgias, urticarial rash, flank pain, chest pain, and associated elevated inflammatory markers. Oral methotrexate (15 mg weekly) was added in August 2018 as a steroid sparing agent, with initial improvement. Due to a recurrence of pericardial effusion and inability to increase her methotrexate dose due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 4 weeks) was added in December 2018. Given continued disease activity, the patient was switched to subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg daily) in January 2020 and methotrexate and tocilizumab were discontinued. During this time, her condition remained stable on oral losartan (100 mg daily).\n\nHer rheumatologic disease was quiescent for several months on anakinra, but then the patient developed fever and dry cough requiring admission in March 2020. Infectious work up was negative. Laboratory work-up was concerning for flare of her AoSD although she lacked her usual symptoms of joint pain, sore throat, chest pain, and rashes (). She improved with an increased dose of oral prednisone to 30 mg daily. Shortly after that admission, she developed acute on chronic kidney injury with nephrotic range proteinuria and progression to ESRD. Her anakinra dose was reduced to every other day dosing to account for her ESRD.\n\nShe was admitted to the hospital in September 2020 for fever, malaise, headache, dyspnea, cough, and diarrhea. On presentation, her temperature was 101.4 F, blood pressure 97/55 mmHg, and heart rate 119 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing female, normal conjunctiva, unremarkable oropharynx without pharyngeal erythema, sinus tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs, clear lung fields, benign abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, unremarkable joint examination without evidence of synovitis, malar rash, chest hyperpigmentation, intact cranial nerves, left arm weakness, intact sensation, and intact reflexes. Anakinra was held due to her fevers and ongoing infectious work-up. Laboratory work-up was significant for leukocytosis, worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, and CK 4000 U/L (). CT CAP showed new splenomegaly as well as lymphadenopathy. The patient rapidly deteriorated, resulting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and death within a few days of admission. There was concern that she may have progressed to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (new cytopenia, splenomegaly, high-grade fevers, profoundly elevated ferritin) but additional supportive laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy were not obtained. Autopsy revealed bilateral lung consolidation with red hepatization of all five lobes, green\u2013black mucosal discoloration around the gastric fundus, and hepatosplenomegaly with liver weight of 211 g (expected 1500\u20131800 g) and spleen weight of 414 g (expected 125\u2013195 g). It was concluded that the cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.",

AoSD is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder that affects young adults and children. It is characterized by recurrent fevers, arthritis, and salmon-pink skin rashes. The disease can involve multiple organ systems, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system. The diagnosis of AoSD is based on a combination of clinical criteria, including fever, arthritis, and elevated inflammatory markers, as well as histopathologic findings of active inflammation in affected tissues.",

His oncological history included immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as a paraneoplastic syndrome with 7000 platelets/mcL, associated with a 4.6-cm lung carcinoma as an incidental diagnosis. Diagnostic testing was performed, ruling out syphilis, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, without gamma alteration in serum protein electrophoresis or any blood smear findings. No further autoantibody tests were performed. Corticosteroids were administered during 1 week at 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone doses together with intravenous immunoglobulins during 5 days, with complete resolution of ITP.\n\nAfter surgery, stage IIB (pT2aN1), moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed. Surgical margins were affected, thus treatment was completed with concurrent weekly docetaxel with radiotherapy with good tolerance. Six months after initial presentation, early progression was evidenced with pleural thickening and pleural effusion. The pathological study was completed with no targeted mutations found and with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) <1% in tumor cells and 25% in stroma cells by 22C3 immunohistochemistry assay. First-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel was started, with partial response after receiving six cycles. Eighteen months after finishing first-line chemotherapy, with maintained response, new pleural progression was evidenced, as confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan. It was thus decided to start a second line with atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody).\n\nTwo weeks after receiving immunotherapy, he presented to the emergency room with severe dyspnea accompanied by intense asthenia, myalgia, and fever of 39 \u00b0C. He denied contact with people suffering coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) infection. Upon presentation, he was conscious and alert with all neurological functions preserved, hemodynamically stable, tachypneic, with 93% oxygen saturation in room air. He looked pale and had bruises on both arms on physical examination. Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly stood out, and auscultation revealed an abolition of left lung sounds. A blood test confirmed moderate pancytopenia, glomerular filtration rate of 50 ml/minute (previously normal), an increase in acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein and ferritin), and elevated levels of D-dimer >20 times normal value (). A computerized angiotomography was performed with no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, neither lung infiltrates nor pleural effusion.\n\nDuring the next 24 hours, he started vomiting with an altered level of consciousness with drowsiness. He had miotic pupils, without other signs of neurological dysfunction. On examination, he had developed progressive jaundice with abdominal pain in the right flank. A few hours later, he suffered a tonic\u2013clonic seizure. Initially, COVID-19 was rejected, and blood tests were repeated at 24 hours, revealing pancytopenia, hyperbilirrubinemia, and hypertransaminitis. Head computed tomography (CT) was performed with no alterations, and a blood smear showed anisocytosis with some elliptocytes. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated due to neurological deterioration with a score of 8 on the Glasgow scale. After assessing the risks and benefits, no lumbar puncture was done. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started, but the possibility that it was a hemophagocytic syndrome was raised and a differential diagnosis was started. Serologies were negative for HSV1-2, CMV, EBV, HIV, HBV, HCV, and HLTV-1 viruses. Elevated IL-6 (19.4 pg/mL) and CD25 (6516 U/m) were found with normal angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. He had 110 CD4 and 620 CD8 lymphocytes with very low CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.18. H-score for hemophagocytic syndrome was 256 points (> 99% probability). Given the high suspicion, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was initiated using 20 mg dexamethasone bolus as 1 mg/kg equivalent of methylprednisolone since day 1. Finally, bone marrow biopsy was performed, showing reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis, and dysplastic signs in megakaryocytic and erythroid reactive lines.\n\nFig. 1 A Bone marrow biopsy with reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis (red arrow), and dysplastic signs in megakaryocytic and erythroid reactive lines. B, C Hepatic and spleen tissue with hemophagocytosis Full size image Severe pancytopenia persisted despite transfusions, so it was decided to initiate tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg, without success, so we continued with anakinra without analytical or neurological improvement during day 2. Treatment with mycophenolate mofetil was added on day 3 for the next two days and finally, 5 days after admission, etoposide 100 mg/m2. Without any clinical improvement, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, showing extensive white matter damage . To study the degree of brain involvement, an electroencephalogram was done and revealed symmetrical background activity consisting of a 2\u20134 Hz, bilateral, irregular, low-voltage rhythm with no reactivity to eyelid closure\u2013opening, corresponding to diffuse and severe degree brain involvement. Hence, it was decided to limit the therapeutic effort.\n\nFig. 2 MRI T1 and T2 sequences with extensive involvement of supra- and infratentorial white matter, with bilateral and asymmetric damage, deep and superficial, of corpus callosum and internal capsules.

One and a half years ago, he underwent radical unilateral orchiectomy. Pathology revealed malignant mixed germ cell tumor with abundant necrosis, comprising 50% teratoma, 45% embryonal carcinoma, and 5% yolk sac tumor. The mixed germ cell tumor was limited to the testicle without evidence of invasion. Lymph nodes were not examined pathologically. Alpha fetal protein (AFP) was mildly elevated at 9 ng/mL (reference range: 0\u20136.7 ng/mL) and normalized postoperatively. The patient opted for surveillance instead of chemotherapy after consultation with an oncologist. Three months prior to admission, the patient started experiencing fatigue and weight gain of 18 kg over 2 months. He was diagnosed with hypogonadism based on a low testosterone level of 127 ng/dL and started testosterone supplementation. Three weeks prior to admission, he began experiencing difficulty with upward and downward gaze. His fatigue continued to worsen, and he stopped working. One week prior to admission, he developed confusion, which manifested in difficulty remembering his dogs\u2019 names and asking questions in strangely worded ways. He also developed bilateral tremor and ataxia, causing him to fall on a daily basis. The worsening of these neurological symptoms led him to present to the emergency department. While hospitalized, he had an episode of syncope. As this was being evaluated, he was noted to have hypovolemia due to polyuria, which was concerning for diabetes insipidus and, consequently, hypothalamic involvement of his underlying disease. Ultimately, the patient did not meet criteria for diabetes insipidus but did have elevated prolactin of 52.0 ng/mL, concerning for some hypothalamic injury. Due to suspicion that his condition could extend to the pituitary, the patient underwent testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The decreased levels of the above hormones revealed probable panhypopituitarism, with TSH of 0.11 mcIU/mL, free T4 of 1.0 ng/dL, ACTH of <2 pg/mL, LH of 0.5 pg/mL, and FSH of 1.3 mIU/mL. Of note, he was placed on high-dose steroids immediately and has consistently been on these higher-dose steroids, so he has been unable to undergo a cosyntropin test to confirm central adrenal insufficiency. He also underwent a neurologic work-up, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI imaging of the pituitary, which showed T2 prolongation involving the bilateral mesial temporal lobes, hippocampi/fornices, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies and mammillothalamic tracts, and midbrain including periaqueductal gray with normal pituitary (Figs. 1 and 2). His presentation was concerning for encephalitis involving subcortical white matter, deep brain structures, and dorsal midbrain. A lumbar puncture showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and was positive for oligoclonal bands. A broad infectious work-up was otherwise negative. He received high-dose steroids, five sessions of plasmapheresis, and 5 days of intravenous immunoglobulin, without significant improvement in his physical examination or mental status. Repeat ultrasound of the testes, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans, and AFP levels were all normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer. He was discharged with close follow-up.

Unfortunately, the patient did not make significant improvement after his hospitalization, losing the ability to walk and to clear his nasopharyngeal secretions. A few months later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) for progression of his condition, which was complicated by thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, sepsis, and worsening neurological status. During this hospitalization, the patient underwent tracheostomy and placement of a gastric tube. Repeat brain MRI showed similar areas of signal abnormality from prior brain MRI but with mildly decreased intensity . Repeat PET/CT scans and ultrasound of the testes were once again normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer or metastases. However, the patient was initiated on cyclophosphamide and lacosamide. Upon discharge, the patient continued with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, lacosamide, and levetiracetam. Now, 8 months after his initial hospitalization, the patient is closely followed by neurology and endocrinology and remains disoriented with fluctuating levels of alertness.

Gorlin syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and other developmental anomalies. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the PTCH1 gene, which is located on chromosome 9q22.3. The PTCH1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that acts as a receptor for the hedgehog signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in embryonic development and cell proliferation.",

His initial birth weight was 2381 g (25\u201350th percentile). He failed his newborn pulse oximetry cardiac screen and was first seen by cardiology at 2 weeks of age. He was followed in the cardiology clinic again at 1 month of age. At that time, an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a sinus tachycardia of 200 beats per minute and hypertension. An echocardiogram was significant for left ventricular hypertrophy with septal wall thickness in diastole of 7 mm and a posterior wall measurement of 5 mm consistent with left ventricular noncompaction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype. He was also noted to have different skin tones and pigmentation from trunk to lower extremities. He was started on a beta-blocker with plans to follow up in clinic in 2 months and was referred to dermatology for evaluation of the skin lesions.  \nAt 6 weeks of age, he presented to the cardiomyopathy clinic owing to left ventricular hypertrophy and was also having difficulty feeding. He was then admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive. At admission, his weight was 3100 g (<\u20092nd percentile), length was 48 cm (3rd\u201310th percentile), and head circumference was 34 cm (<\u20092nd percentile). His physical examination findings were significant for hypertension (101/68 mmHg), tachycardia, facial fullness, hyperpigmented lesions on his skin, marked hypotonia, and hepatomegaly. He had irregular hyperpigmentation characterized as a swirling pattern over the back measuring approximately 5\u2009\u00d7\u20092 cm in area under the right axilla and extending to the right portion of the anterior trunk, stopping at the midline.  \nLaboratory findings demonstrated transaminitis: aspartate transaminase (AST) 99 U/L (normal 22\u201363 U/L); alanine transaminase (ALT) 250 U/L (normal 13\u201339 U/L); total bilirubin 2.3 mg/dL (normal 0.2\u20131.0 mg/dL).  \nA chest radiograph raised concern for cardiomegaly, and an osseous x-ray showed multiple lesions of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia . Genetics was consulted during the hospital admission. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the findings of adrenal fullness on a renal ultrasound in conjunction with the hyperpigmented lesion, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cardiomyopathy, and elevated liver function tests (LFT). Repeat echocardiograms showed persistent concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, with initial thickness of the left ventricular wall of 4.7 mm (Z-score 2.6) reaching a maximum of 7.1 mm (Z-score 1.7) (). Systemic hypertension was confirmed with systolic pressures up to 130 mmHg and diastolic pressures up to 77 mmHg.  \nFig. 1  \nSkeletal survey demonstrating polyostotic fibrous dysplasia; top left, right upper extremity; top right, left upper extremity; bottom left, left femur  \nFull size image  \n Measurement of left posterior wall thickness (LV PW) on each echocardiogram  \nFull size table  \nA renal ultrasound was negative for renal vein anomalies, and metanephrines were also found to be normal.

Her presentation at the hospital was driven by worsening of these symptoms. She had history of intermittent burning type of epigastric pain prior to pregnancy. She also had contraction and leakage of liquor of 2 hours duration which started while on the way to our hospital. There was no history of vaginal bleeding. Upon arrival, the patient was in acute distress, with the following vital signs: blood pressure, 95/60 mmHg; pulse rate, 132 beats per minute (bpm); respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 35.9 \u00b0C. Abdominal examination showed a grossly distended, rigid, and diffusely tender abdomen, which showed limited movement with respiration. Uterine fundal height was consistent with the gestational age. There were three uterine contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting for 35\u201340 seconds. The fetal heart beat (FHB) ranged from 120 to 158 bpm.

A decision was made to perform a laparotomy after delivery. The patient received resuscitation, antibiotics, and underwent vaginal delivery of a male neonate. A subsequent laparotomy revealed a perforated duodenal ulcer, which was repaired. The patient was transferred to the ICU and discharged in stable condition with a prescription for omeprazole.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nAssistant: The most likely diagnosis is acute duodenal ulcer perforation. The patient's symptoms of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and inability to tolerate oral intake are consistent with duodenal ulcer disease. The presence of a perforation is supported by the patient's acute distress, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. The perforation was confirmed by imaging and laparotomy.",

    "original_case": "We present a rare and interesting case of a 68-year-old White male. His past medical history included hypertension, prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy, and a benign parotid tumor status post-parotidectomy 20 years prior. He was retired from working in corporate management, and family history was significant for lung cancer in his father and breast cancer in a sister. Comorbid illnesses included gastrointestinal reflux disease, for which he took ranitidine 150 mg daily and omeprazole 20 mg daily; hypertension, for which he took lisinopril 12.5 mg daily; hyperlipidemia, for which he took atorvastatin 20 mg daily; and seasonal allergies and asthma, for which he took montelukast 150 mg daily and loratadine 10 mg daily. He was also using naproxen and cannabis for cancer-related pain at time of presentation. He was a lifelong non-smoker and did not drink alcohol to excess. He first noticed his right neck mass while shaving 3 months prior to presentation. He reported some mild pain with swallowing, weight loss of unknown amount, right neck sensitivity to light touch, increased hoarseness, and a raspy voice. He was initially diagnosed by his primary care physician as having lymphadenopathy secondary to a sinus infection and received two rounds of antibiotics. The mass failed to improve and, as a result, a fine needle aspiration of the lesion was performed. Evaluation of the biopsy material demonstrated dysmorphic cells containing cytoplasmic keratin, which stained positively for CK5/6, consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma. Monoclonal PAX-8 (Biocare Medical, BC12) staining was also focally positive . Subsequent laryngoscopy revealed no mucosal lesions, but right vocal cord paralysis was observed. A CT of the neck with contrast revealed a 4.8 cm peripherally enhancing hypodense mass with central necrosis lateral to the right hyoid bone, emanating from the thyroid gland . Multiple smaller nodular lesions within the prevertebral space, right paraesophageal region, and superior mediastinum were also identified. A staging PET scan showed a hypermetabolic right thyroid lobe with extensive conglomerate pathologic adenopathy at the right cervical lymph node chain, extending inferior to the right thoracic inlet, as well as a left retropharyngeal hypermetabolic lymph node, but no evidence of distant metastasis (Fig. 2B and C). On initial physical and neurologic examination, the oncology team noted a large, firm, fixed right medial neck mass without overlying skin changes, and a normal cranial nerve exam.\n\nFig. 1 H&E stained cell block slides (A and B, 60X) demonstrating dysmorphic cells (arrows). CK5/6 immunohistochemical stain (C, 60\u00d7) with cytoplasmic staining highlighting cells of squamous differentiation.

Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Pre-treatment diagnostic CT neck (A) and staging PET/CT (B, C) scan revealed a large right necrotic and PET-avid thyroid mass. Full size image\n\nThe patient\u2019s case was discussed at the head and neck multidisciplinary tumor board, with a consensus opinion that this squamous cell carcinoma was indeed of thyroid origin. Extensive surgical resection including a laryngectomy, thyroidectomy, and reconstruction followed by adjuvant chemoradiation as a potential curative course was recommended. However, due to the morbidity and lifestyle implications associated with surgery, the patient declined surgery and instead chose to pursue concurrent chemoradiation with weekly chemotherapy. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was used to treat the right thyroid mass to 70 Gy in 35 fractions at 200 cGy per fraction, as well as bilateral retropharyngeal nodes cervical neck nodal levels IB, II, III, IV, and V to 63 Gy in 35 fractions at 180 cGy per fraction . The patient completed radiation with weekly concurrent carboplatin-paclitaxel over 7 weeks. During treatment, he developed grade 2 fatigue, grade 2 mucositis, grade 2 dermatitis, grade 3 dysphagia, and grade 3 dry mouth with thickened secretions with excessive mucus. The skin desquamation was treated with silver sulfadiazine and mineral oil-hydrophil petrolat. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed during the first week of treatment due to nutrition and oral intake difficulties at baseline, and the patient lost less than 15 lbs throughout the treatment. Long-term toxicity was significant for chronic xerostomia and dysphagia, requiring a permanent gastrostomy tube. He also developed treatment-related hypothyroidism and was started on levothyroxine approximately 3 months after completion of treatment, when his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was found to have gone up from 1.63 (baseline, normal) to 21 mIU/mL (elevated).\n\nFig. 3 Axial view of patient\u2019s CT-based radiation treatment plan. 6 MV photon beams were utilized, and patient was prescribed to 7000 cGy in 35 fractions to the isocenter. Dose color wash is represented as a percentage relative to the prescribed 7000 cGy dose. Thyroid mass contours are delineated in red and are treated to 7000 cGy, while retropharyngeal and cervical neck nodal levels IB, II, III, and IV are delineated in yellow and treated to 6300 cGy. Full size image\n\nAfter receiving concurrent chemoradiation, the patient underwent two additional cycles of high-dose carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel every 3 weeks. Follow-up imaging after concurrent chemoradiation suggested a partial therapeutic response. PET (18-fluorodeoxyglucose/18-FDG)/CT of the neck demonstrated that the thyroid mass had decreased in size from 5.0 \u00d7 5.2 cm, with maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) of 35.3, to 3.8 \u00d7 2.1 cm, with maximum SUV of 19.4 (Fig. 4A\u2013C). This was also apparent on physical examination, where the tumor was smaller, softer, and less tender to palpation. The right and left neck lymph nodes were also notably smaller and demonstrated less PET-avidity. Imaging of the chest, however, revealed pulmonary metastases up to 9 mm in size, as well as multiple bilateral hypermetabolic nodules (Fig. 4D and E).\n\nFig. 4 Post-concurrent chemoradiation PET/CT imaging with carboplatin/paclitaxel reveal a smaller thyroid tumor size (A) and decreased PET-avidity (B, C), but show new bilateral pulmonary metastases (D, E). Full size image\n\nIn light of the new pulmonary metastatic disease, additional systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel was recommended to the patient. However, he opted for immunotherapy instead due to previous chemotherapy side effects and subsequently completed nine cycles of pembrolizumab. Imaging studies obtained after the third cycle of pembrolizumab demonstrated an interval decrease in the size of multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally, suggesting a positive response to therapy . At the same time, however, a CT scan demonstrated an increase in the size of the thyroid mass . Additionally, new encasement of the distal common carotid artery, carotid bifurcation, and proximal internal carotid artery was present, and erosion of the thyroid cartilage was also identified. After the sixth cycle of pembrolizumab, imaging continued to demonstrate enlargement of the thyroid mass with increased extension to the tracheoesophageal groove, while the pulmonary nodules continued to get smaller (Fig. 5C and D). Following the ninth cycle of pembrolizumab, the thyroid mass had continued to enlarge, eroding the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, extending into the paraglottic space, and invading the cervical esophagus. No new or worsening pulmonary metastatic disease was identified at this time (Fig. 5E and F). The tenth cycle of pembrolizumab was halted due to leukocytosis (WBC 21.81 and ANC 19.05) and the patient\u2019s desire to pursue supportive care. Fifteen months after his initial diagnosis, the patient was transitioned to comfort care and died 3 months later. Autopsy was not performed as the patient\u2019s desire was to donate his body to science.\n\nFig. 5 Post-immunotherapy CT imaging demonstrates enlarging thyroid tumor but stable (white arrows) or decreased pulmonary metastases (dotted arrows) after three cycles (A, B), six cycles (C, D), and nine cycles (D, E) of pembrolizumab.

    "original_case": "The first case was a 49-year-old Saudi man who was found unconscious by his brother. He was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical services (EMS). On arrival, he showed decreased consciousness, hyperventilation, low-grade fever, and tachycardia. His family initially suspected that his condition was attributable to a drug overdose. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated because his Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score remained 9 despite efforts to stimulate and resuscitate him. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 136/84 mmHg; heart rate, 145 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 56 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 10 mmol/L. His physical examination was unremarkable apart from the presence of bilateral pinpoint pupils. After initial stabilization in the ED, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of low GCS and unstable vitals. He was maintained on mechanical ventilatory support and vasopressors because of hypotension. During the second day of his stay in the ICU, he started to show signs of worsening mental status and his computed tomography (CT) scan showed evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. His stay was complicated by ongoing evidence of sepsis and end organ damage represented by acute kidney impairment, worsening coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and positive blood culture screen, with evidence of infective endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography. This was managed by antibiotics and aggressive fluid and inotropic support. One week after admission, he showed no improvement in mental status and worsening neurological weakness. His repeated magnetic resonance imaging showed new middle cerebral artery infarction and the possibility of multiple infarcts. Attempts at weaning him from ventilatory support were unsuccessful and ended with placement of tracheostomy insertion. The patient was discharged on nasogastric and tracheostomy tubes in a stable condition but with poor functional state.\n\nOur second patient was a 24-year-old man who was brought to our institution by EMS after a road traffic accident. Upon initial assessment, he was found to be intoxicated and agitated. His GCS score was 13. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 114/61 mmHg; heart rate, 95 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% on room air; and glucose level, 5.7 mmol/L. His initial examination showed a red left eye but was otherwise unremarkable; furthermore, his extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST) examination was negative. Apart from agitation, the findings of the patient\u2019s physical examination were normal. The patient was hemodynamically stable upon assessment, with no signs of bleeding or other obvious injuries. He was acidotic with a pH of 7.25, and his HCO3 level was 10 mEq/L, as determined by analysis of the initial venous blood gas sample. Serum osmolality was 290 mOsm/kg. He received a fomepizole infusion; however, soon after sobering and admission, he discharged himself against medical advice.\n\nThe third patient was a 26-year-old man with no history of serious diseases, who presented to the ED complaining of blurry vision, vomiting, and hyperventilation that started the previous day after the consumption of an unknown amount of alcohol. He was alert and oriented to time, place, and person, with a GCS score of 15. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 141/75 mmHg; heart rate, 92 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 100% in room air; and glucose level, 5.2 mmol/L. Analysis of his venous blood sample showed a pH of 6.9, and the HCO3 level was 5.7 mEq/L. The anion gap in his serum sample was 20 mEq/L, with a measured osmolality of 310 mOsm/kg (reference range, 275\u2013295 mOsm/kg). His vision continued to diminish after admission. His management included fomepizole infusion, hemodialysis, thiamine infusion, and application of sodium bicarbonate boluses. Two days after admission, his laboratory markers normalized and he was discharged back to his normal condition, except for his vision derangement where he was referred to an ophthalmology specialized clinic where follow-up was lost.\n\nOur fourth patient was a 25-year-old woman with a history of iron deficiency anemia who presented to the ED complaining of shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, left flank pain, blurry vision, and palpitations. These symptoms had progressed over the last 3 days with alcohol consumption before she presented at our institution. The patient was conscious and oriented to time, place, and person. Her initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 138/94 mmHg; heart rate, 104 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 4.7 mmol/L. Her venous blood gas pH was 7.32 and HCO3 level was 15 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 280 mOsm/kg and the anion gap was 15 mEq/L. During admission, she received four doses of fomepizole infusion as per the institution poison control center protocol (0.9 g intravenous loading dose then 0.6 g q 12 hours). After completion of therapy, she was discharged home in her normal baseline condition.\n\nThe fifth patient was a 20-year-old woman who had been admitted and treated in another hospital for 1 week for acidosis and intoxication. She presented to our ED complaining of a 2-day history of bilateral complete vision loss. She had no other complaints. Her initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 107/55 mmHg; heart rate, 54 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 99% in room air; and glucose level, 6 mmol/L. Her venous blood gas pH was 7.3 and HCO3 level was 14.9 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 278 mOsm/kg, and the anion gap was 15 mEq/L. Upon admission, the patient received fomepizole infusion and was admitted for 3 days, during which time her condition improved, and she regained her vision. No hemodialysis was required. Patient was lost to follow-up after referral to ophthalmology.\n\nOur sixth patient was a 27-year-old man who presented with complaints of vomiting and severe abdominal pain, restlessness, and blurry vision after alcohol consumption 2 days prior to his visit to our institution. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 134/90 mmHg; heart rate, 84 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 4.7 mmol/L. His venous blood gas showed a pH of 7.1, and the HCO3 level was 5 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 296 mOsm/kg and the anion gap was 33 mEq/L. Fomepizole, thiamine, folic acid, sodium bicarbonate infusion, and hemodialysis treatment were started. During his hospital stay, he received fomepizole as per the poison control center institution protocol (15 mg/kg intravenous loading dose of fomepizole followed by 10 mg/kg q 6 hours during his dialysis). He remained on continuous renal replacement therapy for 24 hours. He was discharged the next day after improvement and resolution of all his symptoms.\n\nThe seventh patient was a 36-year-old man who presented with complaints of fatigue, loss of appetite, and chest pain after consumption of alcohol 2 days prior to his visit to our institution. He had no visual symptoms and his GCS score was 15. The initial pH of his venous blood gas was 7.2, and the HCO3 level was 15 mEq/L. Serum osmolality was 277 mOsm/kg. He was administered fomepizole, folic acid, and sodium bicarbonate treatments and was soon discharged in good condition.\n\nOur eighth patient was a 19-year-old woman with no history of serious diseases, who presented with acidosis, abdominal pain, vomiting, and blurred vision 2 days after the consumption of contaminated alcohol. The pH of her venous blood gas was 7.1, and the serum osmolality was 278 mOsm/kg. She was started on continuous renal replacement therapy upon admission, and given fomepizole, folinic acid, bicarbonate infusion until resolution of her symptoms was achieved. She was discharged back to her normal healthy baseline, with a referral to ophthalmology for follow-up.\n\nThe ninth patient was a 20-year-old woman who developed abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and blurred vision after attending a party. Analysis of her venous blood sample showed a pH of 7.34 and HCO3 level of 18 mEq/L. She was started on continuous renal replacement therapy upon admission and started on fomepizole infusion as per the poison control center institution protocol (15 mg/kg intravenous loading dose of fomepizole followed by 10 mg/kg q 6 hours during dialysis).

Our patient was descended from a nonconsanguineous parent. Her mother was completely asymptomatic, while her father had been diagnosed with the same condition when he was 42 years of age, and he had been on hemodialysis for the last few years because of chronic renal failure. The pattern of this disease inheritance in her family suggested an X-linked type, as her brothers were asymptomatic. At the same time, her only sister had shown hematuria since she was a teenager. Genetic testing was offered to the patient and her offspring but declined as the test was not insured financially.\n\nAfter three successful pregnancies and 3 years from her last delivery, the patient is normotensive, had a normal kidney function test, and was not undergoing any specific treatment. However, recently she had been found to have some auditory changes from tinnitus, mild neurosensory hearing loss, and mild lenticular myopia caused by her anterior lenticonus.\n\nFirst pregnancy (2009)  \nAt the age of 23, the patient came to the antenatal clinics at 7 weeks of gestation, and an early ultrasound examination confirmed a pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and the blood pressure was 90/70 mmHg. Her baseline investigations showed a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dl, 2+ protein from urine analysis, and serum creatinine of 41 \u00b5mol/l (62.0\u2013106.0 \u00b5mol/l). Twenty-four-hour urine collection measured 1.870 g protein. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth assessment, proteinuria, and kidney function testing. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted to the obstetric unit for monitoring because of rising proteinuria of 4.300 g in 24 hours and a borderline amniotic fluid index at 34 weeks. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg.\n\nAt 37 weeks of gestation, 24-hour urine collection measured 5.694 g protein, creatinine 49 \u00b5mol/l, total protein 53.4 g/l (60\u201380 g/l), and albumin at 27.8 g/l (35\u201352 g/l). She had a cesarean section at 37 completed weeks for an obstetric reason (breech presentation) and delivered a healthy, 2530 g female newborn baby. Proteinuria dropped down to the early pregnancy levels shortly after delivery. The patient recovered smoothly after surgery and was discharged home with her newborn infant. The patient had a follow-up visit at the nephrology clinic after 2 weeks of her puerperium, which revealed proteinuria of +2 and creatinine of 52 \u00b5mol/l. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the second pregnancy.\n\nSecond pregnancy (2015)  \nAt age 30, the patient came once more to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 13 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg. There was a +1 protein in the urine, and the creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth and fetal well-being assessments, as well as the recording of proteinuria and creatinine levels. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted at 30 weeks of gestation so that her borderline amniotic fluid index could be assessed. At 34 weeks of gestation, the patient had an elevated blood pressure of 140/89 mmHg, for which she was again admitted to the hospital for observation. Proteinuria was 3.900 g in a 24-hour collection, serum creatinine was 44 \u00b5mol/l, hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dl, and the platelet count was 222 \u00d7 10^3/mm^3. The total serum protein was 51 g/l, albumin was 27.0 g/l, normal levels of alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase being 8.9 U/l and 15 U/l, respectively. She had a cesarean section due to a suspected dehiscence scar and gave birth to a male newborn infant weighing 2300 g, who was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The mother\u2019s proteinuria and blood pressure dropped shortly after 2 weeks of her delivery. The mother and the newborn infant were discharged home in good health. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the third pregnancy.\n\nThird pregnancy (2017)  \nAt age 32, the patient presented to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 12 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. A 24-hour urine collection showed 1.010 g in 2400 ml. The serum creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetrics and nephrology care was established with serial growth and fetal well-being assessment. At 28 weeks, during a routine antenatal visit, a dipstick for protein showed +3, while the 24-hour urine collection revealed 2.400 g in 1300 ml. Her blood pressure was normal all through her antenatal period. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. At 34 weeks, the protein in the 24-hour urine collection measured 2.900 g in 1200 ml, while serum creatinine was 45 \u00b5mol/l and hemoglobin level 9.1 g/dl. A cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks for obstetric reasons, and a male newborn of 2500 g was delivered and sent to the nursery. After 2 days, the mother and her newborn infant were discharged home. After 4 weeks, the patient was reevaluated once more, and she was doing well, with a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg and a 24-hour urine collection measuring 1.700 g in 2200 ml. There were no auditory or ophthalmological complaints. Late follow-up was lost apart from a few visits documented to the auditory and ophthalmology clinics.",

She had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 5 weeks before her visit, which was detected because she was in close contact with her husband who had COVID-19. She remained asymptomatic for 10 days during the COVID-19 isolation period; however, she began to feel general fatigue and back pain 3 days later. She complained of bilateral upper back pain without irradiation. This condition was moderate in severity and was not relieved by rest. Her appetite was hindered owing to abdominal bloating, frequent belching, and constipation. She lost 4 kg of weight in 3 weeks and was admitted to the hospital. She had a history of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and oral allergy syndrome to melon and watermelon with eosinophilia. Absolute eosinophil count was 1645/\u00b5L, 26% of white blood cell count, on the laboratory data 1 year before. Although she had been experiencing numbness in her bilateral hands for 3 months, she did not take it seriously, assuming it was due to her daily manual labor. A month before, she had been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome at another clinic. She was given a budesonide/formoterol inhaler, montelukast, theophylline, mirogabalin, and methyl-cobalamin, which is conventionally prescribed for peripheral neuropathy in Japan. Her blood pressure was 142/115 mmHg, pulse rate was 113 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on ambient air. Physical examination revealed slight inspiratory fine crackles on the left chest but no wheezing. Cardiac auscultation revealed no gallops or murmurs, and cervical inspection showed no jugular venous distention. A pale rash was observed, which changed to palpable erythema on the entire back  in a week. No eruptions were observed on the chest, abdomen, and extremities. She presented with sensory disturbances in the bilateral median nerve territories, as well as a positive Phalen test and Tinel sign. Lower limb hypoesthesia and weakness of the left tibialis anterior muscle were observed. Generalized hyperreflexia was also observed, but it was not accompanied by pathological reflexes. The eyes, nose, thyroid gland, abdomen, and superficial lymph nodes showed no abnormalities. Fig. 1 Palpable erythema, without pruritic or painful sensation, was present on the whole back in a reticulated pattern, colored light brown to light red. Laboratory results revealed an absolute eosinophil count of 11,956/\u00b5L, as well as elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, positive rheumatoid factor, and negative anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). Liver and kidney function tests were normal, and urinalysis revealed no proteinuria, hematuria, or cast.  summarizes the major laboratory data. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia. Left ventricular ejection fraction was normal, and there was no evidence of ventricular hypertrophy, dilation including the right ventricle, valvular abnormality, or pericardial effusion on echocardiography. Bilateral patchy ground-glass opacity areas were observed on chest computed tomography (CT), which were indistinguishable from the residual COVID-19 lesion . There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism, or abnormal findings of abdomen on the contrast-enhanced CT. A nerve conduction study revealed signs of axonal injury, namely reduced amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials and normal sensory nerve conduction velocities in the bilateral median nerve and the right-sided ulnar and sural nerves. Normal distal latencies on the bilateral median nerves ruled out carpal tunnel syndrome. The physical examination findings, including anterior tibialis muscle weakness, indicated a mononeuritis multiplex pattern. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated normal cellularity with increased eosinophil count of 65.2% without dysplasia, and FIP1L1\u2013PDGFRA fusion gene was negative on fluorescence in situ hybridization. A biopsy of the skin lesion showed perivascular and perineural eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation. There was no evidence of necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis or extravascular granulomas. Although the patient presented abdominal discomfort, there were no abnormal findings in gastrointestinal investigations with upper endoscopy and colonoscopy.  Clinical laboratory results.

GBS is an acute inflammatory polyneuropathy that can be triggered by various infections, including viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The patient's recent history of COVID-19, along with the presence of sensory disturbances, muscle weakness, and hyperreflexia, are consistent with GBS. The patient's symptoms, including back pain, abdominal discomfort, and loss of appetite, may be related to the post-COVID-19 syndrome, which can manifest in various ways. The patient's eosinophilia, elevated immunoglobulin E levels, and positive rheumatoid factor may indicate an underlying autoimmune condition, which could be exacerbated by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient's history of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and oral allergy syndrome may be related to an allergic reaction, which could also be a contributing factor to the development of GBS.

He had also fallen down and needed help getting back up. The patient was a retiree who had previously worked in law enforcement. He had no significant past medical history and did not take regular medications. He had a long-term history of smoking (80 pack-years) and consumed three alcoholic drinks daily. His general practitioner had noted a new diabetes mellitus with a glucose of 28 mmol/L when the patient presented in his practice 5 days earlier, but had not started treatment. The patient did not report coughing, chills, or chest pain. On physical examination, he appeared dyspneic and had an altered mental status but could still speak complete sentences. He had a blood pressure of 141/105 mmHg, pulse rate of 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% without supplemental oxygen, and temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. He had cold extremities with a capillary refill < 3 seconds. No other signs such as peripheral edema, heart murmurs, pericardial friction rub, or pulmonary crackles were present. Excepting the altered mental status, the global neurological examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 341 mg/L, neutrophilic leukocytosis with leukocyte count of 12.6 \u00d7 10^9/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 96 mmol/mol, mildly elevated hepatic transaminases, and low serum myocardial markers. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed partially compensated respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.49, pCO2 3.5 kPa, pO2 12.6 kPa, HCO3 19.4 mmol/L, base excess \u22122.4 mmol/L, sO2 97%) (see Additional file 1 for all laboratory values at first presentation). Chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis but no evident pleural effusion or infiltration . Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a QS pattern in V1\u20134, suggestive of an old anterior wall myocardial infarction. Point-of-care echocardiography was performed and visualized large, circumferential pericardial effusion . Also, wall motion abnormalities were seen that supported the theory that the patient had experienced an out-of-hospital anterior myocardial infarction in the weeks to months before the current presentation. The day after admission, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed with immediate drainage of 600 mL of purulent fluid. Analysis of the fluid indicated a leukocyte count of 267 \u00d7 10^9/L, total protein of 51 g/L, and lactate dehydrogenase pericardial fluid-to-serum ratio of 8.7. As Gram stains of blood revealed Gram-positive diplococci, antibiotic therapy consisting of continuous, intravenous infusion with 6 million international units benzylpenicillin daily was initiated. At admission, blood culture specimens for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria had been collected and directly transported to a BacT/Alert Virtuo system (BioM\u00e9rieux). Later on, these blood cultures as well as pericardial fluid cultures grew (serotype unknown). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that the isolated strain was susceptible to a variety of antibiotics including penicillin, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.016 mg/L. Initially, insulin and metformin were started for the newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Acetylsalicylic acid and low-molecular-weight heparin were started to prevent occlusive vascular events. Moreover, during the admission, several other medications were started for cardiovascular protection, to treat electrolyte imbalances, and to supplement vitamins because of the previous alcohol use (see Additional file 2 for all medication administered during admission). \n\nFig. 1 Chest X-ray showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis with mild volume loss.

LV left ventricle, RV right ventricle Full size image \n\nIn the days following pericardiocentesis, a further 635 mL of purulent pericardial fluid was drained through the pericardial catheter and the patient\u2019s clinical condition improved markedly. Daily, bedside transthoracic echocardiography confirmed adequate drainage of the pericardial effusion. The patient did not develop any symptoms that pointed us in the direction of a primary focus (for instance, no coughing, urinary complaints, or back pains). Repeated chest X-rays did not show signs of pneumonia or empyema. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody assay was negative, as were tests for other microorganisms (ELISpot for detection of M. tuberculosis; hepatitis C virus serology; and feces assays for C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and norovirus). The CRP level dropped to 102 mg/L. However, 6 days post-admission, the patient\u2019s condition suddenly deteriorated with a blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg, sinus tachycardia of 131 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute. A small amount of sanguineous fluid drained through the pericardial catheter. Echocardiography revealed reaccumulation of pericardial fluid including blood clot formation at the level of the right chamber in the pericardial cavity. Moreover, the wide inferior vena cava, right ventricular compression, and increased respiratory inflow variation (> 25%) over the mitral valve were indicative of cardiac tamponade. Attempts to clear the drain blockage by flushing with saline and adjusting the catheter\u2019s location in the pericardial cavity did not lead to evacuation of any pericardial fluid. Thus, as removal of the obstructing blood clot through the pericardial catheter proved impossible, the patient was transferred to a tertiary hospital to undergo emergent cardiothoracic surgery. Immediately before transfer, the patient went into cardiac arrest and he was ultimately transported with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Unfortunately, surgical removal of the clot proved unsuccessful, and the patient died only hours after onset of his sudden hemodynamic deterioration. In consultation with the family, no autopsy was performed.",

He had a recent fall and required assistance to get back up. The patient, a retired law enforcement officer, had a significant smoking history (80 pack-years) and consumed three alcoholic drinks daily. His general practitioner had noted new-onset diabetes mellitus with a high glucose level of 28 mmol/L during a recent visit but had not initiated treatment. On examination, the patient appeared dyspneic with an altered mental status but was able to speak full sentences. Vital signs showed a blood pressure of 141/105 mmHg, pulse rate of 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% without supplemental oxygen, and a temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. The patient had cold extremities with a capillary refill < 3 seconds. Laboratory results revealed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 341 mg/L, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.6 \u00d7 10^9/L, and a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 96 mmol/mol. Imaging studies showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis on chest X-ray. Electrocardiogram findings were suggestive of an old anterior wall myocardial infarction. Echocardiography displayed a large, circumferential pericardial effusion with associated wall motion abnormalities, supporting a previous myocardial infarction. \n\nThe patient underwent pericardiocentesis, draining purulent fluid with analysis showing high white cell count, total protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. Blood and pericardial fluid cultures grew an unknown serotype, sensitive to various antibiotics including penicillin. Treatment with benzylpenicillin was initiated.

The swelling was small initially and progressively increased in size to attain the current size. She had visited a nearby health center on multiple occasions for this complaint and took unspecified antibiotics, but experienced no improvement. Apart from the local mild pain and discomfort, there was no history of cough, fever, weight loss, night sweating, or other constitutional symptoms. She has no family history (first-degree relatives) of diabetes, hypertension, or any other remarkable noncommunicable disease including cancer. Her past medical history is not significant, except for occasional mild dyspeptic symptoms; she took unspecified over-the-counter anti-acids a couple of times for her dyspepsia as the symptoms arose. She has no history of admission to hospital. She has no history of any form of surgical procedure. She has no history of smoking. Except for the mild-to-moderate amount of local alcohol beverages she consumed on holidays, she has no history of excess alcohol consumption. She is a janitor in a public school. She is unmarried and lives with her parents. She has a fianc\u00e9 and uses a combination of natural calendar method and male condom for contraception. She has no history of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or injectable or intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) use. She has no history of pregnancy. She reported that she has regular menstrual cycles and no significant past obstetric or gynecologic history. On physical examination, her general appearance was stable, healthy looking, and ambulating. Vital signs were as follows: pulse rate, 82 beats per minute; blood pressure, 110/80 mmHg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; temperature, 36.2 \u00b0C. She has pink conjunctiva, non-icteric sclera, and no abnormal finding on head and neck examination. On lymphoglandular system (LGS) examination, there was an approximately 5\u2009\u00d7\u20094 cm solitary mass in the left axilla . It was firm in consistency, nontender, well defined, mobile, and completely separated from the left breast. Skin over the mass was normal with no nipple, areola, or ulceration. There were no clinically significant findings detected on examination of breasts, right axilla, or the other externally accessible lymph node regions. On chest examination, it was symmetrical and moved with respirations, and clear breath sounds were heard on auscultation. On precordial and cardiovascular examinations, the normal S1 and S2 heart sounds were heard, there was no murmur or gallop, and all the peripheral arterial pulses were palpable with strong and regular pulse. Abdomen was soft to palpation. No hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or mass was detected, and there were no signs of fluid collection. No costovertebral angle tenderness or abnormal finding was detected on genitourinary system (GUS) examination. No pedal or other subcutaneous edema was identified on musculoskeletal examination. No palmar pallor or skin lesions were seen on integumentary system examination. On neurologic examination, she was conscious, alert, and fully oriented to time, place, and person. Cranial nerve examination revealed normal findings. No motor or sensory deficit was detected, and deep tendon reflexes were normal. On the basis of the above findings, a provisional clinical impression of axillary lymphadenopathy due to either lymphoma or tuberculosis was considered. Fig. 1 Firm nodular mass in the left axilla Full size image Laboratory investigations done on the same day of her presentation including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and chest X-ray were noncontributory. On CBC, white blood cell (WBC) count was 5900/mL with 53% granulocytes, 42% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 4% monocytes. Platelet count was 247,000/mL. Hemoglobin was 13.4 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 89 fL. ESR was 13 mm/hour. Renal function test revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 13 mg/dL, and serum creatinine level was 0.78 mg/dL. On liver function test, total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL, serum albumin was 4.4 g/dL, and serum aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT/SGPT) were 29 and 33 IU/L respectively. All of these laboratory test results were within the normal reference range of our laboratory. Urinalysis was also done, and it was normal. Owing to the limited number of pathologists and long waiting list of patients, she was scheduled for fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Two weeks after her initial presentation, FNAC from the mass was done and smears were stained with Wright\u2019s stain following the standard procedures. Microscopic examination revealed cellular aspirates of tight cohesive clusters of bland ductal cells in branching stag-horn-like pattern along with numerous scattered bare nuclei on the background and fibromyxoid stromal fragments . Lymphoid cells were not seen. Abdominopelvic ultrasound and echocardiography were normal.

The mass first appeared as a small induration and progressively increased in size. She had menarche at age 14 years, with 3 days of menstruation in a 28-day cycle. There was no history of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and bowel or urinary change, and no significant past medical history although she was taking the antihypertensive amlodipine (tablet, 10 mg daily) for hypertension. She had a surgical history of open myomectomy for symptomatic fibroids 3 years prior to presentation. There was no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus, asthma, cancer or sickle cell disease. She defined herself as a social drinker and non-smoker (no history of smoking). The results of a prior ultrasound examination at a different hospital suggested a condition, and based on this scan, she was offered a hysterectomy at that hospital prior to her presentation at our own facility. General and neurological examinations were unremarkable, with a pulse rate of 74 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, and a body temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. Abdominal with bimanual pelvic examination revealed a giant abdominopelvic mass, equivalent to a 36-week gestational uterus, extending in all directions to fill the abdominal cavity. It was not attached to the overlying structures but seemed to have originated from the pelvic cavity. Subsequently, based on evidence of this abdominopelvic mass, we carried out a preoperative work-up, with the results showing a packed cell volume (PCV) of 36%, fasting blood sugar of 80 mg/dl, blood group O+ (positive), sero-negativity for hepatitis B and C, and normal values for urinalysis, electrolytes, urea, and creatinine. The abdominopelvic scan revealed an anteverted, empty, and markedly bulky uterus that measured about 283 \u00d7 156 mm, with the fundus close to the xiphisternum. The endometrial stripe measured about 4 mm in thickness, with what appeared to be diffuse enlargement of the uterine myometrium with no succinct myometrial mass.

In addition, there was no specific medication, smoking history, or alcohol consumption. The cause of the accident was a methanol-based paint spill on his clothes that ignited; this incident occurred at a plating factory (Fig. 1: day 1). He was transferred to our hospital for emergency treatment. On arrival, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 165/102 mmHg, and pulse rate of 90/minute. His body temperature was 37.3 degrees Celsius. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was E4 V5 M6, and there was no motor or sensory paralysis. Physical examination revealed 25% total-body-surface-area flame injuries (7% partial thickness on the trunk and right hand and 18% full thickness on the right arm, both legs, and chest). There were no problems with hand function. On day 2 after admission, the wounds on his two thighs and right arm were debrided, and Integra dermal regeneration templates (Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA) were applied. On day 9 after admission, the wounds on his right lower leg, right arm, and chest were debrided, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. On day 16 after admission, the Integra silicone sheet was removed, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. Epithelialization had occurred in most parts of the injury; however, the graft failed in the proximal one-third portion of the left thigh, resulting in an ulcer. With topical treatment with a silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing (Aquacel\u00ae Ag BURN: ConvaTec, Princeton, NJ, USA) for 6 days, petroleum gel (PROPETO\u00ae; Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 6 days, a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb, Maruho, Osaka, Japan) for 3 days, and silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh; ALCARE, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 days, the ulcer was covered with healthy granulation tissue (Fig. 1: day 36).

The meshed split-thickness skin graft (STSG) was fixed, and NPWT was applied to both the donor and recipient sites Full size image On day 37 after admission, an operation was performed. The ulcer surface was debrided, and an 11/1000-inch (0.28 mm) skin graft was taken from the ipsilateral thigh and meshed, using a 1:1.5 ratio. A slightly larger skin graft was taken, and the excess skin graft was immediately regrafted to the donor site. The regrafted skin was meshed using a 1:1.5 ratio, the same as the recipient site. NPWT (INFOV.A.C.\u2122 Therapy System, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) was then applied to both the donor and recipient sites with a continuous negative pressure of 125 mmHg. A silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh) was inserted between the skin graft and polyurethane foam dressing (V.A.C. GranuFoam Dressing, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) to avoid damage to the skin graft (Fig. 1: day 37). On days 37 and 38 after admission, 1 g of cefazolin was administered intravenously every 8 hours as perioperative prophylaxis. On day 43 after admission, the polyurethane foam dressing was removed from both the donor and recipient sites. Although the regrafted skin at the donor site was taken completely, the skin graft was not found at the recipient site, and the entire area was covered with granulation tissue (Fig. 2: day 43, left). No granulation tissue overgrowth was observed at the donor site. The staples that had held the grafts in place were embedded in the granulation tissue and were removed. On the same day, the wound was cleaned under running tap water, and small islands of epithelialization were visible under the granulation tissue. NPWT was ceased, and topical treatment with a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb) was applied (Fig. 2: day 43, right). Rapid epithelialization of the ulcer was observed as the granulation tissue regressed, and epithelialization of both the donor and recipient sites was almost completed on day 48 after admission (5 days after NPWT cessation) (Fig. 2: day 48). No significant change was observed between pre- and postoperative laboratory findings (). In addition, no significant findings were observed in urinalysis on day 17 (), and no further urinalysis was performed during hospitalization because no specific symptoms appeared.

The patient had a history of alcohol and tobacco use but otherwise no significant medical history. His left forearm was caught between the motor vehicle and the road, and became highly compressed and retracted. The patient was hemodynamically stable with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15, a blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, body temperature of 36.1 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Laboratory test results were as follows: hemoglobin 16.3 g/dL; hematocrit 46%; white blood cells 8100/mm3, with no left shift; platelets 195,000/mm3; urea 14.5 mg/dL; creatinine 0.8 mg/dL; total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL; direct bilirubin 0.07 mg/dL. Major vascular and visceral injuries were not suspected. Physical examination and radiography showed an open radial shaft fracture with marked swelling of the left forearm . The patient was given 0.5 mL of tetanus toxoid vaccine intramuscularly and administered prophylactic antibiotic using intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g. Compartment pressure was measured in three different areas of the forearm, showing 40 mmHg in the volar component and 30 mmHg in the dorsal forearm compartment. Five hours after the injury, surgery was performed under general anesthesia. First, we made a curvilinear skin incision on the volar aspect of the forearm from the biceps tendon to the palm of the hand for carpal tunnel release . We performed a debridement of the involved muscles; however, we could not perform an internal fixation or immediate reconstruction owing to the risk of advancing the myonecrosis of the forearm muscles. After release of the superficial and deep flexor compartments, pressure in the dorsal compartment decreased. The wound was closed with vessel tape, utilizing the shoelace technique. After the release, the patient was not able to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. At second-look operation (3 days after the initial release), swelling of the left forearm had reduced with no evidence of infection. Therefore, we performed open reduction and internal fixation for the left radius fracture and PL tendon transfer to the FPL tendon. Intraoperatively, the presence of the intact PL tendon was confirmed. The PL tendon was advanced to the FPL tendon, and an interlacing suture was performed thrice. The tendon was transferred with the wrist in 30\u00b0 of dorsiflexion and the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the thumb in 45\u00b0 of flexion. The wrist and thumb were immobilized in a slightly flexed position using a splint for 3 weeks, following which active flexion and extension exercises of the thumb were started. The patient was discharged 32 days after hospital admission in a relatively good state of health. Six weeks after the reconstruction, passive extension exercises of the thumb were started. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had no complaints and had returned to his former job, despite slight residual muscle weakness of the FPL. The patient regained the full range of thumb interphalangeal joint flexion\u2013extension. At 2-year follow-up, the patient had acquired 88% of pinch strength compared with the contralateral hand and scored 11.4 on QuickDASH score.",

She developed lung disease and was started on pembrolizumab. After 3 months, her lung disease progressed, and she was switched to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and nivolumab 1 mg/kg for four cycles with concurrent radiotherapy to a dominant lung lesion. Her maintenance nivolumab was halted after 2 months as she required steroids for radiation pneumonitis. She subsequently received anti-PD-1 directed therapy with anti-LAG-3 on a clinical trial, but her disease progressed after two cycles with progressive bilateral pulmonary and pleural based masses, increase in a right pericardial deposit, enlargement of a soft tissue mass adjacent to the spleen and a nodule adjacent to the right kidney with an unchanged lytic lesion within the L3 vertebral body. She received 18 Gy in one fraction of palliative radiation to the L3 spinal lesion 3 days prior to HD IL-2 for pain (day 1). She was then admitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses on days 4 through 7. Treatment was held for colitis and atrial fibrillation. She was administered nivolumab 480 mg on day 19. The patient was subsequently admitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses on days 22 through 25. Therapy was held due to colitis and shortness of breath, with atrial fibrillation after dosing that resolved in a few days per usual after stopping HD IL-2. CT scans on day 53 showed an 8% decrease in target lesions and overall stable disease per RECIST v1.1. The patient elected to receive a second course of nivolumab and HD IL-2 therapy with nivolumab 480 mg given on day 53 followed by standard bolus HD IL-2 on day 58 (7 doses) and day 77 (8 doses), both limited by fatigue. Usual side effects from HD IL-2 included colitis, renal insufficiency, shortness of breath, electrolyte issues, hepatitis, and mucositis all resolving to grade 1 or better at the time of dismissal from the hospital. She received two more doses of nivolumab 480 mg on schedule every 4 weeks with scans on day 73 and day 122 showing disease stability. Two months after her last dose of HD IL-2, she elected to change therapies to chemotherapy due to progressive pain. Scans on day 182, 6 months after the initiation of therapy, showed progression of disease due to growth of nontarget lesions.\n\nPatient 2 is a 56-year-old Caucasian male with NF1 mutated cutaneous melanoma (tumor mutation burden 1.3 mutations/megabase) who originally presented with a left finger stage IIIC melanoma. He was treated with surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Scans showed extensive lymph node disease, and he was started on ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which was discontinued after three cycles due to hypophysitis ultimately requiring thyroid and adrenal hormone replacement. His cancer subsequently progressed, and he was started on a clinical trial of nivolumab with an anti-LAG-3 antibody, but after one cycle had clinical progression with extensive chest wall disease. He was started on palliative radiation to the chest wall mass and received 45 Gy in ten fractions on days 1 through 11. He received 480 mg of nivolumab on day 6. He was admitted for HD IL-2 course 1 cycle 1 and received 11 doses on days 12 through 16. Treatment was held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. He also experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, hyperbilirubinemia, colitis, and recurrent fevers after completion of HD IL-2 dosing, which resolved by discharge. He was admitted for cycle 2 of HD IL-2 and received 10 doses on days 33 through 36. Treatment was held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. Nivolumab 480 mg was administered on day 39. Digital photography on day 72  and CT scans on day 71  showed dramatic improvement of disease in the chest wall and lungs (not irradiated). He had clinical improvement in a left upper arm lesion, which was not in the imaging field. The patient received further nivolumab on day 72 and was admitted for a second course of HD IL-2 on day 77 (10 doses). Treatment was again held for thrombocytopenia and altered mental status. He was admitted again on day 90 and received nine doses before therapy was held for altered mental status and abdominal pain. Nivolumab was administered on day 108, and subsequent scans on day 127 confirmed response to therapy with further decrease in target lesions. Scans on day 197 showed no evidence of disease. Follow-up scans on day 266, day 350, and day 454 also showed no evidence of disease. He later developed progressive anemia, and subsequent endoscopic evaluation on day 547 showed a bleeding mass in his stomach that was biopsy proven. He elected to enroll into hospice and died on day 566.\n\nPatient 3 is a 55-year-old Caucasian female with BRAF wild type cutaneous melanoma (tumor mutation burden 4 mutations/megabase), aortic stenosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient had excisions of two melanomas 20 years prior, followed by adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, cisplatin, IL-2, and IFNa. She had recurrent melanoma 2 years prior to presentation and received ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg for four cycles followed by nivolumab maintenance with no clear benefit. She had talimogene laherparepvec injections, which were poorly tolerated, followed by resection, and an additional four doses of ipilimumab and nivolumab without benefit. The patient subsequently received arginase on a clinical trial with progression followed by a dose of carboplatin and paclitaxel for a progressive malignant pericardial effusion. She received 39 Gy in 13 fractions of palliative radiation to her pelvic disease from day 1 until day 21. She had nivolumab 480 mg on day 19. The patient was admitted for HD IL-2 and received eight doses on days 22 through 25. Dosing was interrupted at dose number 4 due to fevers, rigors, and chest ache during red blood cell transfusion, possibly secondary to transfusion reaction. Therapy was resumed after 8 h and was stopped after her eighth dose due to worsening respiratory status with increased oxygen requirements and respiratory rate. The patient was dismissed 48 h after the last dose of HD IL-2 and symptoms resolved. The patient was readmitted for HD IL-2 and received nine consecutive doses from day 41 through 44. Therapy was held after dose 9 due to abdominal pain secondary to colitis and worsening respiratory status. The patient received nivolumab 480 mg on day 55. CT scans on day 71 showed decreased tumor burden in bilateral pelvic masses, with the right pelvic mass being the primary radiation site. Formal response assessment for this patient is not possible due to the inclusion of measurable lesions in the radiation field. Further cycles were not given as she fractured her arm while working and subsequently chose to pursue other treatments.",

    "original_case": "A 51-year-old female of African ethnicity was referred to our oncology center for adjuvant therapy. She had a chief complaint of occipital headache which was associated with dizziness and projectile vomiting for over a year. She had no history of chronic illness. She had three children, and all childbirths were done by cesarean section. She had no previous history of blood transfusion. She had no history of malignancy or cancer within her family. She worked as a nurse. She was married. She denied a history of use of tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs. All vitals were within normal limits. Physical examination was essentially normal. Neurological findings showed that all cranial nerves were within normal limits, and there was no motor or sensory deficit, but she had poor coordination of movement. Basic laboratory investigations were done and included: complete blood count (WBC-4.92\u2009\u00d7\u200910^3/uL, Hb-12.3 g/dl and platelet-165.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910^3/uL), urea (5.5 mmol/L), serum creatinine (85.19 micromol/L), alanine aminotransferase (23.1 IU/L), Aspartate aminotransferase (30.1 IU/L), total bilirubin (0.19 mg/dl), and albumin (38.45 g/L) essentially normal with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test. Brain MRI was conducted  and showed a left posterior fossa mass, which had an iso-hypointense appearance on T1-weighted images, an inhomogeneously enhanced appearance on T1-weighted contrast images and iso-hyperintensity on T2-weighted images .\n\nA ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedure was conducted before surgery to overcome hydrocephalus. Craniotomy for the posterior fossa tumor was done . The patient was placed in prone position with her head supported on the Mayfield head holder. A posterior midline suboccipital approach was used. Through the displaced left cerebellar, a grayish solid mass, with an undefined border, was identified and dissected carefully with cauterization of the feeder vessels. Subtotal tumor resection (STR) was done, and hemostasis was achieved. Dura closure was achieved with a dura patch, and the bone flap was returned. Wound closure was done in layers. A histopathology sample from the mass was obtained. The postsurgery phase was uneventful. Histopathology revealed cells with minimal cytoplasm and dense basophilic nuclei present in diffuse sheets (Figs. 3 and 4). Reticulin staining was not done because it was not available. Immunohistochemical analysis and molecular subgroup were also not performed because they were not available.\n\nWe did not carry out CSF analysis to investigate the leptomeningeal spread of the tumor due to concerns about transtentorial herniation.

We stratified the tumor as high risk, and the staging was modified to Chang stage M0. \n\nShe was simulated by using CT\u2013Simulator in supine position. The headrest and a thermoplastic head and neck mask were used to restrain the head. Contouring was done for the target and the organs at risk. Laterally parallel opposed fields with photon energy of 6 MV were used to treat the brain , and two direct posterior adjacent fields were used to treat the spinal cord . Collimator rotation was used to match the cranial and spinal fields, and a feathering maneuver was used in the two adjusted spine fields to avoid hotspots. The radiotherapy technique was 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) using a linear accelerator (LINAC). The patient underwent two phases of treatment. The first phase was craniospinal radiation therapy (CSRT) whereby 36 Gy in 20 fractions was delivered, and the second phase was the posterior cranial fossa boost, whereby a boost dose of 18 Gy in 10 fractions was delivered. A weekly dose of 2 mg vincristine was administered intravenously with radiation therapy. \n\nUpon completion of radiotherapy, she was put on a monthly course of adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy (etoposide 50 mg/m^2 D1\u2013D4 and cisplatin 20 mg/m^2 D1\u2013D4) for a total of six cycles from June to September 2021. \n\nPost-treatment brain MRI showed a significant decrease in the posterior fossa tumor .",

    "original_case": "A 65-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital with a 12-hour history of diffuse colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain had arisen suddenly and presented a gross localization to the upper quadrants. He had failed to pass feces and gas for the last 2 days and reported no significant abdominal symptoms before the event except for mild stypsis. His past medical history included a previous thoracoscopic mitral valve repair and mild renal insufficiency secondary to ectopic hypoplastic left kidney located in the pelvis. He had no history of previous abdominal surgery. Upon physical examination, we found significant abdominal distension, severe spontaneous pain in the upper abdomen without guarding or positive Blumberg sign, and tympany on percussion. The body temperature was 37 \u00b0C, and all vital parameters were normal. Digital rectal examination revealed empty ampulla with normal fecal residues. A nasogastric tube was positioned, and about 400 ml of biliary effluent was drained.\n\nBlood tests revealed neutrophilia (leukocytes 9.98 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl; neutrophils 9.08 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 65 mg/L). Abdominal X-ray, in turn, showed diffuse abdominal distension of both small and large bowel with multiple air\u2013fluid levels. The small bowel presented valvulae conniventes without mucosal thickening, while the large bowel showed coprostasis and regular haustration. Cecum diameter measured about 6 cm .\n\nFig. 1\nAbdominal X-ray\nFull size image\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was thus performed showing an anatomical abnormality of the colon and diffuse dilation of both the small bowel and colon. The sigmoid colon was elongated and formed a distended loop in the subhepatic recess above the right flexure. Cecum and ascending colon were in their normal position, while the left ectopic kidney was found on the left side of the pelvis. Pancreas, duodenum, right kidney, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric artery had no significant abnormalities .\n\nFig. 2\nCoronal view of abdominal Computed tomography scan (from anterior to posterior): (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery\nFull size image\nImportantly, the lack of left kidney bulk in the left flank altered the course of the colonic portions corresponding to the splenic flexure and descending segment. The splenic flexure was twisted counterclockwise on the frontal plane, causing the descending colon to be more medial and posterior. The latter therefore crossed posteriorly to the body of pancreas near the L2 vertebral body and descended anteriorly to the psoas muscle. From there onward, the course of the sigmoid colon could be divided into four segments. The first segment began in the left iliac fossa, turning right and crossing the midline at the level of the L5\u2013S1 intervertebral disc near the upper pole of the left ectopic kidney. The second segment turned sharply upward directed to the subhepatic recess running anterior to the inferior vena cava and crossing the right common iliac artery anteriorly and the ileocolic vessels and proximal transverse colon posteriorly. The third segment formed a dilated loop in contact with the gallbladder and the lower aspect of the right hepatic lobe. The fourth segment continued in an inferior direction running along the right side of the inferior vena cava, crossing the right side of the promontory, and terminating in the rectum. Since the third part was dilated to 5 cm in diameter and the second and fourth parts were compressed, the sigmoid colon appeared to be involved in a closed-loop occlusion. A C-shaped fluid-filled loop of ileum with beak-like proximal and distal narrowing was found near the fourth part of sigmoid colon, resembling a closed-loop small bowel obstruction. Both the ileal loop and the sigmoid colon appeared to be incarcerated in a narrow space behind the ileocolic vessels.\n\nThe inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was also characterized by an abnormal course. This originated from the aorta 2.5 cm above the aortic bifurcation and ran rightward, giving rise to a long recurrent left colic artery and some directed upward sigmoid branches. It then turned downward into the pelvis as the superior hemorrhoidal artery. The left colic artery had an extremely long course: it originated from the IMA via a common trunk with the first sigmoid artery to the right side of the aorta and crossed it running left and upward. The left renal artery originated on the anterior face of the aortic bifurcation and flowed downward to the ectopic kidney located on the left in the small pelvis .\n\nFig. 3\nSchematic drawing of the anatomical abnormalities. (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery; (12) first sigmoid artery; (13) inferior vena cava; (14) aorta; (15) ectopic left kidney\nFull size image\nGiven the complex anatomy, we opted for exploratory laparoscopy, which revealed a recess on the right posterior peritoneum traversed by the sigmoid colon. An ileal loop was trapped within this space, resulting in an internal hernia with upstream bowel dilation. This recess was limited anteriorly by Toldt\u2019s fascia, the ascending colon and adhesions spanning between the ascending colon and the abdominal wall. These adhesions were similar to the Ladd\u2019s bands described in malrotations. The ileal loop was extracted from the recess and did not appear ischemic, with deflation ensuing shortly after this procedure. The sigmoid colon was then extracted, revealing thick adhesions between the sigmoid colon and the posterior abdominal wall forcing the sigmoid colon to recoil inside the recess once traction from laparoscopic clamp was eased. Given the inability to safely lyse these adhesions, we decided to convert to open surgery. The adhesions of the sigmoid colon and its mesosigmoid with the retroperitoneum were partially lysed, allowing the sigmoid colon to remain in natural position without tension. Thereafter, a suture of the hernial breach was performed between the lower edge of Toldt\u2019s fascia and the retroperitoneum. We did not perform complete lysis of sigmoid colon adhesions as this would have led to the complete mobilization of a dolichosigma with significant risk of volvulus. The procedure was completed with appendicectomy and positioning of abdominal drainage in the pelvis .\n\nFig. 4\nIntraoperative images:\na ileal loop and sigmoid colon in the hernia breach.\nb Ileal loop was extracted from the hernia breach, and the sigmoid colon was carefully extracted.\nc Complete extraction of sigmoid colon shows fixation with the retroperitoneum (1) sigmoid colon; (2) incarcerated ileal loop; (3) adhesions between ascending colon and abdominal wall; (4) ascending colon; (5) adhesions between sigmoid colon and right peritoneum; (6) hernial breach.\nS cranial, I caudal, L left, R right\nFull size image",

There was maternal history of normal healthy live birth in the first pregnancy and spontaneous miscarriages in second and fourth pregnancies in early trimesters. The fourth pregnancy was associated with Down syndrome. The mother was given antenatal progesterone for excess bleeding in the first trimester. From 2 weeks of age, she presented with lethargy, sweating, and breathlessness on feeding. Later on, she presented with recurrent episodes of aspirations with severe lower respiratory infections. Cardiac examination revealed a holosystolic murmur suggestive of ventricular septal defect (VSD). Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with features suggestive of pneumonia . Echocardiography (ECHO) showed moderate VSD (6\u20137 cm subaortic perimembranous VSD), dilated left atrium and left ventricle, trivial aortic regurgitation with aortic cusp collapse, dilated pulmonary artery system with flow acceleration across pulmonary valve, and half-systemic pulmonary artery pressure with normal left ventricular systolic function . There was no pericardial effusion or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. She was managed medically with decongestive medications and antibiotics for lower respiratory infections. She was noted to have laryngomalacia. At 3 months of age, decreased motor movements were noted. She was gaining weight till 5 months of age, after which there was flattening of the growth curve and failure to thrive. At 6 months, she had developmental arrest followed by progressive neuroregression. She also had severe startle response since 8 months of age. Then, she started having generalized recurrent seizures from 9 months onward. The epileptic episodes were mostly focal with secondary generalization, with the most severe event reported as having frequency of ten seizure episodes within 2 hours time period despite anticonvulsant therapy. She had also macrocephaly with coarse facial features, persistent laryngomalacia, and hyperacusis. There was no muscle atrophy. Central hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, and a positive Babinski reflex were elicited. Organomegaly was absent. Ophthalmological examination showed bilateral macular cherry-red spots and an inability to fixate the eyes. At 12 months, she developed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as reactive airway disease. Gastrostomy tube feeding was also commenced.

Ultrasonography of abdomen did not reveal any hydronephrosis or other anatomic abnormalities. Computerized tomography scan of brain without contrast was suggestive of mild bilateral symmetric hyperdensity of thalami . Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slowing of delta frequencies associated with drowsiness. Video-fluoroscopic assessment for swallowing function was suggestive of aspiration on both fluoroscopic runs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed extensive high signal within the supratentorial white matter involving subcortical and deep white matter structures. There was evidence of T1-increased signal in the thalamus and a relatively large head shape. Bilaterally, the thalami demonstrated symmetric reduction of T2 signal and increase in the T1-weighted signal. There was marked delay in myelination as demonstrated on T1-weighted imaging.

Imaging studies showed brain abnormalities consistent with Sandhoff disease. Metabolic workup confirmed the diagnosis with genetic testing revealing a homozygous deletion in the HEXB gene.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nAssistant: The most likely diagnosis is Sandhoff disease. Sandhoff disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzymes hexosaminidase A and B. It is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, seizures, and cardiomyopathy. The disease is caused by mutations in the HEXA and HEXB genes, which encode the enzymes hexosaminidase A and B, respectively. The enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of undegraded substrates in the lysosomes, which can cause cellular dysfunction and damage. The disease is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, and the symptoms can vary widely depending on the severity of the enzyme deficiency. The most common symptoms include developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, and cardiomyopathy. Other symptoms can include macrocephaly, coarse facial features, laryngomalacia, and gastrointestinal problems. The diagnosis of Sandhoff disease is typically made based on a combination of clinical symptoms, family history, and laboratory tests. The laboratory tests may include enzyme ass",

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Japanese man with a chief complaint of hoarseness visited the Otolaryngology Department at our hospital. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a tumor, with its major axis measuring approximately 40 mm in the left upper lobe of the lung. The hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were also swollen . Primary lung cancer was suspected, and the patient was directed to the Department of Respiratory Medicine on the same day that he was admitted to the Otolaryngology Department. He was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by bronchoscopy. We performed transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) for the primary lesion in the left upper lobe and endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the mediastinal lymph nodes 1 week after the first visit. Genetic mutation testing was not performed because the sample was insufficient. Subsequently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) was performed, and abnormal accumulation was observed in the longitudinal hilar lymph nodes (#4L, #5, #10L), vertebral body, and left pleura. The results of the 18F-FDG PET/CT and other findings led to the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma [cT2bN2M1c (PUL, OSS); stage IVB]. We recommended rebiopsy considering the possibility of a genetic mutation, but the patient refused the examination because of strong coughing during the first bronchoscopy and progressive symptoms of hoarseness. The patient strongly desired an early treatment, so we initiated first-line therapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) 3 weeks after the first visit. However, the patient developed grade 2 renal dysfunction [creatinine, 1.83 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 31.23 mL/min/1.73 m2], making it difficult to continue the therapy . We informed the patient about the need for a second bronchoscopy for consideration of further treatment and obtained his consent. Bronchoscopy was performed again, and the patient was diagnosed with ALK-positive NSCLC (immunohistochemistry, 3+; fluorescence in situ hybridization, 56%). In addition, progressive disease was noted . Development of progressive disease required approximately 9 months, and cisplatin and pemetrexed were administered over four cycles, after which pemetrexed alone was administered over five cycles. Thereafter, second-line therapy with alectinib (300 mg/day) was initiated. Three months after starting alectinib, chest CT showed that the primary lesion had shrunk, and we judged it to be a partial response, but the ground-glass opacities and infiltration continued to spread on both sides (Figs. 1d, 2). At this time, the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion, and his saturation of percutaneous oxygen was approximately 82% in room air. Blood gas analysis showed that the partial pressure of arterial oxygen was 58.2 torr, indicating respiratory failure. A pulmonary function test revealed restrictive ventilatory impairment, with a vital capacity (VC) of 2.11 L and a %VC of 57.1%. A diffuse lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 4.84 mL/min/mmHg and a %DLCO of 22.8% indicated diffusion disorder. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)  and TBLB samples  were obtained at this time. The BALF showed an increased lymphocyte ratio (34.4%), and pathological analysis of the TBLB specimen revealed an organizing pneumonia (OP)/nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) overlapping pattern. On the basis of the chest CT results, we suspected alectinib-induced DILD. However, we also considered respiratory infection or cancerous lymphangiopathy with cancer progression in the differential diagnoses. Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 9300/\u00b5L and a C-reactive protein level of 1.41 mg/dL. The BALF culture results were negative. The BALF was lymphocyte dominant, and no findings suggestive of cancer infiltration were observed in the TBLB specimen. On the basis of these results, we excluded the other conditions evaluated in the differential diagnosis. On the basis of the results of chest CT and bronchoscopic pathology, methylprednisolone was prescribed (1 g/day for 3 days). The patient then received oral prednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day), which was gradually reduced, and he was administered steroids for about 3 months. Third-line therapy with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) (100 mg/m2) was initiated after treatment with steroids. However, 3 months later, obstructive pneumonia associated with an increase in the size of the primary lesion was observed . Moreover, mild renal dysfunction persisted (creatinine, 1.63 mg/dL; eGFR, 35.45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Because of this complication and upon the patient\u2019s request for oral medication, lorlatinib (100 mg/day) was administered as fourth-line therapy. Treatment with antibiotics and lorlatinib reduced the lesion\u2019s shadow, and no recurrence of DILD was observed. Thirty-three months after the start of treatment, stable disease has been maintained, and lorlatinib has been continued (Figs. 1f, 4).",

He had a prior episode of suspected convulsion of which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic nodular lesion measuring approximately 60 mm in diameter, located in the left parietal lobe of the cerebrum. The patient was administered medication, and symptoms were subsequently relieved. However, 12 days later, he experienced worsened symptoms and was transferred and admitted to the emergency department of the University of Miyazaki Hospital. MRI showed a mass of 70\u2009\u00d7\u200953\u2009\u00d7\u200957 mm in the left temporoparietal lobe (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). A solid element with slight hypointensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images along the dura mater was noted. Cystic changes were likely associated with the sanguineous fluid. A peritumoral band with hyperintensity on T2-weighted image was observed at the periphery of the lesion, suggesting an extra-axial lesion . A dural tail sign was also noted on the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image . The lesion appeared to be focally infiltrative to the brain surface, but no apparent connection to the ventricle was observed (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). Preoperative clinical diagnosis included hemangiopericytoma and ependymoma as differential diagnoses. Left parietotemporal craniotomy was performed. The tumor was an extra-axial mass and had partially infiltrated the dura mater and surface of the brain parenchyma in the left temporal lobe. Small pieces of tumor tissue were removed for intraoperative diagnosis. Under an emergency setting, near-total resection was achieved even if the lesion was in the eloquent area. The patient received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (total dose 54 Gy). However, within 1 year postsurgery, the tumor recurred and a second resection surgery was performed. Four years after the first surgery, the tumor metastasized to the spinal cord and the patient eventually died (total postoperative follow-up period was 4 years and 4 months).

She has a history of migraine, for which she had been taking diclofenac sodium SR. Two months prior to this episode, she had developed itching of her palms after taking a diclofenac sodium SR tablet, which had resolved spontaneously. Apart from one incident of food allergy to northern pilchard, she had no food or drug allergy. She had no history of asthma. At the onset of her symptoms, the patient had taken 4 mg of chlorpheniramine for itching and continued to do household chores. Although the itching subsided after about 15 minutes, she felt lightheaded and weak on standing, which prompted her to lie down. Her postural symptoms resolved within 5 minutes of lying down. Over the next 20 minutes, she developed a dry cough with difficulty breathing. Her chest symptoms were relieved after taking two puffs of salbutamol from a metered-dose inhaler prescribed for her daughter. Subsequently, as the itching recurred with hives, she decided to seek medical care. The patient again felt dizzy and lightheaded on getting up and therefore remained supine while traveling to the hospital. On admission to the emergency department, she was conscious and rational, with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and supine blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 99% on room air. Examination revealed skin erythema, cutaneous edema, mild urticaria, and scattered rhonchi in both lungs. The rest of the system examination was normal. She was given intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg and chlorpheniramine 10 mg. Her vital parameters were monitored continuously. Intramuscular (IM) adrenaline and intravenous fluid were withheld because of high blood pressure. As the patient was tachycardic, nebulized adrenaline or salbutamol was not given. Her cutaneous and respiratory symptoms improved with treatment, but pulse rate and blood pressure remained persistently high. Forty minutes later, she felt the need to pass urine and was advised to use a bedpan. However, as the patient insisted on using the washroom, she was asked to sit up on the bed without standing immediately. Her dizziness and lightheadedness recurred within minutes of sitting up, and a dramatic drop in her blood pressure from 198/100 mmHg to 80/60 mmHg was observed. She was put back in the supine position, and her legs were elevated. Intramuscular adrenaline 0.5 mg was administered immediately, and a fluid bolus was given. As the blood pressure remained low (80/62 mmHg), IM adrenaline was repeated twice, 5 minutes apart, until the systolic blood pressure was more than 100 mmHg. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further observation. Her postural symptoms resolved completely after the administration of adrenaline. Her blood pressure fluctuated over the ensuing 24 hours with frequent high readings, and she remained tachycardic. Noteworthily, her blood pressure readings after treatment with adrenaline were not as high as the blood pressure at presentation. There were no hypotensive episodes. All her basic laboratory investigations, including full blood count (FBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and renal function tests were normal. Serum tryptase was not done as the clinical criteria for the diagnosis were met. Two days later, when she was discharged from the hospital, her blood pressure was 165/95 mmHg. On discharge, a diagnosis was made with a probable diagnosis of essential hypertension. She was prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector for emergency use and advised not to take diclofenac sodium or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Upon reviewing 2 weeks later, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed that she had previously undiagnosed hypertension. Interestingly, the highest recorded pretreatment systolic blood pressure (BP) was 170 mmHg, which was lower than her blood pressure on admission. All relevant imaging and hormonal investigations to identify a secondary cause for hypertension were found to be normal. She was commenced on telmisartan 40 mg and amlodipine 2.5 mg in the night and showed a good response to treatment. The timeline of events is summarized in Fig. 1.

She has a history of migraine, for which she had been taking diclofenac sodium SR. Two months prior to this episode, she had developed itching of her palms after taking a diclofenac sodium SR tablet, which had resolved spontaneously. Apart from one incident of food allergy to northern pilchard, she had no food or drug allergy. She had no history of asthma.\n\nAt the onset of her symptoms, the patient had taken 4 mg of chlorpheniramine for itching and continued to do household chores. Although the itching subsided after about 15 minutes, she felt lightheaded and weak on standing, which prompted her to lie down. Her postural symptoms resolved within 5 minutes of lying down. Over the next 20 minutes, she developed a dry cough with difficulty breathing. Her chest symptoms were relieved after taking two puffs of salbutamol from a metered-dose inhaler prescribed for her daughter. Subsequently, as the itching recurred with hives, she decided to seek medical care.\n\nThe patient again felt dizzy and lightheaded on getting up and therefore remained supine while traveling to the hospital. On admission to the emergency department, she was conscious and rational, with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and supine blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 99% on room air. Examination revealed skin erythema, cutaneous edema, mild urticaria, and scattered rhonchi in both lungs. The rest of the system examination was normal.\n\nShe was given intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg and chlorpheniramine 10 mg. Her vital parameters were monitored continuously. Intramuscular (IM) adrenaline and intravenous fluid were withheld because of high blood pressure. As the patient was tachycardic, nebulized adrenaline or salbutamol was not given. Her cutaneous and respiratory symptoms improved with treatment, but pulse rate and blood pressure remained persistently high.\n\nForty minutes later, she felt the need to pass urine and was advised to use a bedpan. She was unable to void and developed sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. She was unable to lie down because of the pain and was therefore placed in a sitting position. She was given oxygen via a face mask and intravenous aminophylline. Her blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg. She was then transferred to the resuscitation room for further management.",

However, 3 weeks later, she started experiencing pain in her lower extremities (hyperalgesia), followed by tingling sensation and gradual weakness in all four limbs. Within a few days, she was also unable to urinate and defecate.

He had no odynophagia, dyspnea, fever, rash, constitutional symptoms, or other neurological symptoms. His medical history included only an episode of pneumonia 5 years earlier, and he took no regular medications. He worked as a butcher, was a smoker with a history of 50 pack-years, and did not consume alcohol. There were no significant occupational or environmental exposures. He was born in China and migrated to Australia in his mid-30s. There was no family history of neurological diseases. He had received the scheduled age-appropriate vaccinations in China, not including the chickenpox or varicella vaccines. On examination on his presentation, he was afebrile and the rest of his observations were within normal limits (blood pressure 160/80 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 100% on room air). His speech was normal, and voice was not hoarse. Cranial nerves were intact, there was preserved motor and sensory function in all limbs, and he was normoreflexic throughout. Cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. His throat was not inflamed, with no obvious masses, goiter, or neck lymphadenopathy. He was able to swallow a small amount of water on sip testing, but appeared to have to force-swallow, and choked when trying to sip a larger amount. A neurological examination 3 days later showed an absent right gag reflex, leftward uvula deviation, and absence of elevation of right side of palate with phonation (Additional file 1: Video S1).

The initial symptoms appeared 3 weeks prior to admission, consisting of fatigue, occasional headache, and loss of appetite. Meanwhile, 1 week before hospitalization, fever appeared up to 40 \u00b0C, recurring every 4\u20136 hours. He had previously been treated for a nasopharyngeal inflammation with antipyretics and antibiotics. However, the fever continued, and the illness progressed with vomiting and abdominal pain, fatigue, and refusal to eat. The day before admission at the intensive care unit, his family became concerned by a new onset of bilateral eye redness, swelling, redness of hands and feet, rash, irritability, and photophobia. At admission, he had fever of up to 40 \u00b0C, arterial hypotension with blood pressure (BP) of 70/40 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate (HR) of 130/min, tachypnea with a respiratory rate (RR) of 45/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%, paleness, and dehydration, with a chest capillary refill time (CRT) of 5 seconds. Signs of hyperinflammatory syndrome were also present, with mucocutaneous inflammation signs such as swollen and red eyelids, bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, oral mucosal lesions, dry lips, strawberry-red tongue, and oropharyngeal hyperemia. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Redness and swelling were also present on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (Figs. 1 and 2).\n\nFig. 1\nPalmar erythema on the first day of hospitalization\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nRedness and swelling from the upper surface to the sole of the foot\nFull size image\nThe child\u2019s mental status and level of consciousness were also altered. He was lethargic and irritable, with photophobia during the examination. His lungs were clear and had no murmurs or cardiac friction rub. The abdomen was soft without hepatosplenomegaly, but was painful during palpation. Based on a height of 120 cm and a weight of 34 kg, he had obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 23.6, placing his BMI for age at greater than the 99th percentile. There was a history of positive COVID-19 contact 3 weeks ago when his uncle had a brief febrile upper respiratory infection and was tested and confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Meanwhile, his asymptomatic father had a negative PCR test for SARS COV-2 but positive serology with a high immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to SARS COV-2 on the day of the child\u2019s admission. The child remained at home with his immediate family during this period but was not tested for SARS COV-2 infection. There was no personal or family history of allergic reactions, vasculitis, autoimmune disorders, cardiac disease, diabetes, or hereditary disease. This was the third hospitalization of the child; the first one at the age of 2 due to gastroenteritis; and the second one, at the age of 4, due to a urinary tract infection. Initial laboratory results revealed a high level of inflammatory markers, including a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 156.8 mg/l, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 100 mm/hour, procalcitonin (PCT) of 13.84 (), leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and lymphopenia (). Liver and renal functions were also altered, manifested by hypoalbuminemia (30.6 g/L), hypoproteinemia (60.3 g/L), hyperuricemia (602.77 umol/L), uremia (15.81 mmol/L), and an increased level of serum creatinine (114 umol/L) as a consequence of renal dysfunction (acute kidney injury), which resolved with hydration (). There was a mild elevation of cholesterol and significant elevation of triglycerides (5.29 mmol/L) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT, 79 U/L) with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) levels (). The capillary blood electrolytes (Na, K, Ca) were also altered, with hyponatremia (129 mmol/L), a low level of bicarbonates (19.7 mmol/L), a base excess (BE) of 4 mmol/L, and hypoxemia with capillary blood gas of pO2 of 63 mmHg and pCO2 of 29 mmHg (). A lumbar puncture was performed owing to fever, irritability, altered level of consciousness, and photophobia. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was slightly turbid, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 128/mm3 (80% mononuclear cells and 20% polymorphonuclear), CSF protein of 1.14 g/L (normal range 0.10\u20130.45 g/L) and CSF glucose of 3.84 mmol/L (simultaneous blood glucose level of 5.45 mmol/L). The bacterial culture of CSF was negative. The findings from the CSF examination were consistent with aseptic meningitis. Normal fundus findings were found on ophthalmoscopy examination. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was negative, while SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing was positive. D-dimer was high, at 464 ng/mL and 833 ng/ml by two measurements (reference range \u02c2 200), while the coagulation tests were within the normal range (). The urinalysis revealed proteinuria (30\u2013100 mg/dl), which was confirmed by 24-hour urine collection. Leukocyturia and occasionally bacteriuria were also present, but the urine culture was negative. Moreover, no other obvious microbial cause of inflammation was found, including two blood cultures for bacterial sepsis, three urine cultures, and nasopharyngeal and CSF cultures. \n\n Laboratory values and trends during hospital stay\nFull size table\n Complete blood cells count (CBC) and trends during hospital stay\nFull size table\n Capillary blood gases and electrolytes\nFull size table\nThe chest radiography showed bilateral minimal peripheral patchy opacities but no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax .\n\nFig. 3\nFrontal chest radiography shows bilateral minimal peripheral patchy opacities.

Her mother had noted an absence of tears when crying since birth, diffused pigmentations since birth, especially on the cheeks and genitals, repeated vomiting of both solid and liquid foods, and asthma. The mother also mentioned that the child\u2019s cousin had had similar symptoms. On physical examination, the child showed fatigue with pigmentation on her lips, hyperpigmentation on the nose and under the right eye, signs of growth failure (weight: 25.5 kg; height: 133 cm), dyspnea with a respiratory rate of 40\u201345 breaths per minute, substernal intercostal retractions, hyperpigmentation on genitals, digital clubbing, and hyperkeratosis on the palms and soles. Results of the neurological examination were normal, and the patient\u2019s psychomotor development was also normal. The blood tests results were: Na+, 136 mmol/l; creatinine, 0.6 mg/dl; and urea, 21 mg/dl. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax showed massive dilation of the esophagus and bilateral pulmonary infiltration. Barium swallow test showed massive dilation in the esophagus associated with a tightening in the lower esophageal sphincter (bird beak sign). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed severe dilation in the esophageal lumen with a contraction in the lower esophageal sphincter that continues to the stomach, which confirmed the diagnosis.

She had a history of schizophrenia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She had no previous history of fractures. She first visited an emergency department because of her low back pain that had occurred 4 months earlier and suddenly worsened. However, her low back pain was treated conservatively, because a duty doctor found no significant findings on plain X-ray of her lumbar spine . At the same time, she also complained of dysuria, and a urologist diagnosed neurogenic bladder and cystitis. One month later, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for exacerbation of schizophrenia. At the hospital, she had a urethral catheter inserted because of difficulty urinating on her own. She spent 3 months in bed until her schizophrenic symptoms improved.\n\nFig. 1 X-ray lateral image. a Lateral image of the lumbar spine on admission to the emergency department. Sacral fracture is not evident. b Lateral image of the sacrum on admission to the orthopedic department. A transverse fracture of the third sacral vertebra with displacement is shown.\n\nShe was referred to our orthopedic department because a gait disorder was discovered after her mental condition improved and she was permitted to walk. At the first visit to our department, she could not walk and had loss of sensation from the buttocks to both posterior thighs and around the anus and perineum. Manual muscle testing of her lower limbs showed mild weakness of about 4 in bilateral flexor hallucis longus and gastrocnemius, and bilateral Achilles tendon reflexes were lost. Her anal sphincter was unable to contract, and urinary retention continued after removal of the urethral catheter. Her plain X-ray on admission to the orthopedic department showed a transverse fracture of the third sacral vertebra with displacement, which was not observed in the first X-ray of her lumbar spine on admission to the emergency department . An H-shaped sacral fracture (Rommens classification: type IVb) consisting of a transverse fracture with displacement of the third sacral vertebra and vertical fractures of the bilateral sacral wings was seen on computed tomography (CT) (Figs. 2a, b, 3).

TN had been diagnosed 12 years previously at another hospital, where microvascular decompression (MVD) was carried out but failed to expose the trigeminal nerve. Neurological examinations showed no other abnormalities of the cranial nerve. Three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D-TOF) magnetic resonance (MR) and three-dimensional constructive inference in steady state (3D-CISS) imaging showed obvious neurovascular conflicts (NVCs) due to PTA and the trigeminal nerve and that the PTA originated from the junction of the C3 and C4 segments of the ICA and went up around the inner margin of Meckel\u2019s cave, eventually to terminate into the right superior cerebellar artery (SCA) which anastomosed with the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) .

Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve, which innervates the face. It is characterized by sudden, brief, electric shock-like pains that occur on one side of the face. The pain is usually triggered by touch or movement and can be severe and debilitating. The most common cause of trigeminal neuralgia is neurovascular compression, which can occur when a blood vessel compresses the trigeminal nerve as it passes through the brainstem. This can lead to inflammation and irritation of the nerve, which can cause the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia. Other causes of trigeminal neuralgia include multiple sclerosis, tumors, and infections. The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is typically made based on a combination of medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies such as MRI.",

On physical examination, bilateral well-defined masses were detected in the subscapular area, of which the right-sided mass was larger. Both masses were rubbery and mobile. Also, shoulder movements were not restricted in the examination; however, the patient expressed pain during movements. Contrast material-enhanced CT demonstrated a soft-tissue mass. The borders of the mass were indistinct, but adjacent fat planes were preserved. The majority of the mass had an attenuation similar to that of the adjacent skeletal muscle; however, scattered microscopic linear fat attenuation was seen centrally throughout the mass. There were no nodular areas of contrast enhancement, no calcification, and no adjacent osseous destruction. No tissue sampling or further imaging was deemed necessary for diagnosis, since these were classic imaging findings and the location was typical. Figure 1 shows the CT scan of our patient.  \nFig. 1 Computed tomography of a case (yellow indicator)  \nFull size image  \nSurgical excision was performed owing to the symptomatic nature of the mass at the right side.

The resection was done until the margin where the rubbery consistency of the mass was palpated. It is possible that some parts of the surrounding fibrous tissue remained. A Jackson\u2013Pratt (JP) drain was inserted, and subsequently, the chest wall was closed. Also, the mass was sent for pathological evaluation.  \nThe mass was halved during resection, and two irregular, semi-ovoid, gray-yellowish, rubbery, solid masses were received by the pathologist: one was 5.5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2.5 cm with attached soft tissue of 5.5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 cm, and the other one was 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cm with attached soft tissue of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 cm. The cut section of the larger mass showed a white-yellowish solid area, and the cut section of the smaller mass showed a homogeneous yellowish area without hemorrhage or necrosis.

    "original_case": "With a clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition, a 7-year-old, Turkish male was referred to the Department of Oncology at Hacettepe University for the recurring tumor after local excision of the lesion over his nose. The lesion was a rapidly growing lesion, this time measuring 8 \u00d7 4 cm in size . Physical examination revealed that he also had hemorrhagic crusted plaques and nodules over both eyelids and upper lip, as well as multiple hypo- and hyperpigmented punctate lesions all over his body. Fig. 1 Clinical photograph showing a rapidly growing lesion on dorsum of nose and pigmented macules on sun-exposed regions of the body Full size image Perinatal and early postnatal histories were unremarkable. He had no symptoms before 2 years of age when hyperpigmented spots were first recognized. The parents were first cousins. There was no history of other family members having a similar disorder. There was no known disease in his two siblings, either. The child was regularly immunized. The developmental milestones were normal. Systemic examination, including neurological functions, was essentially normal. Starting at the age of 2 years, the patient had hyperpigmented spots all over his face and arms, more prominent on his forearm, and bilateral widespread hypopigmented areas over the thighs. This abnormal pigmentation progressively worsened on exposure to sunlight, particularly in overexposed areas. With these complaints, the patient received a clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition. When he was 2 years old, a crusted erythematous lesion appeared on the edge of his left eye, as well. Following facial lesion excision, the pathology result was found to be consistent with a tumor. After a year, lesions on one side of his nose and two other parts of his face also were excised and reported again as consistent with a tumor (4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 cm in nasal region, 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 cm in left zygomatic, 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 satellite lesion in maxilla). At the age of 6 years, the patient was admitted to our hospital for a rapidly growing nasal lesion (Figs. 2 and 3). Incisional biopsy was done from the lobulated giant mass that caused narrowing of the right nasal aperture with external pressure. Pathological examination revealed the tumor as being medium to well differentiated. The right submandibular and preauricular metastatic lymph nodes (LN) were noted during the postoperative period. Chemotherapy was started with reduced doses with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil owing to metastatic LN and unresectable primary tumor. Surgical excision could be performed after six cycles of chemotherapy, and the large mass of 9.5 cm in longest diameter was excised from the nose with positive surgical margin. After two more cycles, progressive disease was noted with enlarged submandibular LN and a new lesion on the right eyelid causing blurred vision. Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment was planned with concomitant radiotherapy (66 Gy to the primary nasal mass, 60 Gy to preauricular LN, and 54 Gy to bilateral neck). He received the antibody every 3 weeks for 4 months, and his vision was improved. However, after 4 months, the treatment had to be stopped owing to financial reasons. Control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed improvement in LN, and no new skin lesion was detected. He was followed up without any systemic chemotherapy, but local fluorouracil cream was used for new superficial lesions that appeared on the scalp, tongue, and right auricle.

Invasion of the mass into the nasal passage or ethmoid cells was not detected Full size image After 18 months of follow-up, relapse was observed on a new lesion on his nape. The excised lesion was diagnosed as recurrent tumor. The antibody was planned, but owing to refusal of financial approval of the antibody, another treatment was given for 5 months. Partial response was noted in periorbital lesions, but auricular lesions were stable. The antibody was approved and was given for 15 months. No new lesions or active complaints have been observed in the current situation, and complete remission has been achieved. Owing to the condition\u2019s genetic heterogeneity, WES was performed with Ion Proton next-generation sequencing platform, and the c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation of the gene was detected in the homozygous state. The variant was then validated by Sanger sequencing . This gene was associated with the genetic condition. This homozygous c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation is a mutation not yet reported in the ClinVar database. The parents of the patient were carriers (heterozygous) for the relevant mutation.

NBCCS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by multiple sebaceous adenomas, multiple trichoadenomas, and pigmentary abnormalities. The condition is caused by a mutation in the PTCH1 gene, which is located on chromosome 9q22.3. The PTCH1 gene encodes a transmembrane receptor that is involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. The PTCH1 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated in a two-hit mechanism. The first hit involves a mutation in one allele, and the second hit involves loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing of the remaining allele. The clinical features of NBCCS include sebaceous adenomas, trichoadenomas, multiple pigmented and unpigmented skin lesions, and multiple trichofolliculomas. The skin lesions are typically located on the head, neck, and upper trunk. NBCCS is a rare condition, with an estimated",

He lived alone in a house surrounded by hills. He used the train for transportation, including taking the train station stairs to the second floor to buy the tickets. He was a private driver of a company car. On T + 3 days [T: day patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C)] in 2020, an employee at workplace was diagnosed with an infectious disease, and this was the occasion when our patient came in contact with an infected person. Present medical history The patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C) on day T in 2020, followed by development of dyspnea on day T + 4; on day T + 6, he decided to visit the emergency room of our hospital where he was checked but sent home the same day after receiving a PCR test. On day T + 8, he returned to the same hospital with worsening dyspnea and general malaise. Blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 3500/\u03bcL; lactose, dehydrogenase (LDH) 646 U/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 6.32 mg/dL; ferritin, 2291 ng/mL, and a positive PCR test for the infectious disease. He was admitted to our hospital. Plain chest X-ray on the same day showed extensive frost shadows in the upper and lower lung fields with bilateral peripheral predominance. Chest CT confirmed these findings, showing a broad range of ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening and bilateral peripheral dorsal base predominance . Respiratory function deteriorated rapidly after admission, with the patient requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation on day T + 9. He was transferred to another hospital after considering the potential need for ECMO. On day T + 13, he developed aspiration pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, with further worsening of ventilatory dysfunction, that progressed to bilateral dorsal atelectasis on day T + 14, leading to the initiation of ECMO. He was kept in prone position during the treatment. Following gradual improvement, ECMO was discontinued on day T + 22 as was mechanical ventilation 2 days later. At the last evaluation of the effects of rehabilitation therapy on day T + 29 during the previous hospitalization, the muscle strength was 2 for shoulder abduction, 3 for elbow flexion, 3 for wrist dorsiflexion, 2 for hip flexion, 3 for knee extension, and 3 for ankle dorsiflexion, based on manual muscle testing (MMT). Due to low levels of activities of daily living (ADL), he was transferred back to our hospital on day T + 30 for rehabilitation therapy. Fig. 1 A Plain radiograph of the chest (day T + 8).

Figure is taken from Kashiwabara et al. [5], with permission Full size image On first admission to our Rehabilitation Department he was given a clinical examination and underwent laboratory tests. These showed a height of 171 cm and body weight of 62 kg; full consciousness; no edema; body temperature, 36.8 \u00b0C; heart rate, 86 beats per minute; blood pressure, 114/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 19 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation (SpO2, 97% (on room air). Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.416, partial pressure CO2 (pCO2) 30.2 mmHg, and partial pressure O2 (pO2) 77.7 mmHg. Further tests included those for total protein (6.8 g/dL), albumin (2.9 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 26 mg/dL), creatinine (Cr; 1.32 mg/dL), creatinine clearance (CrCl; 59 mL/minute) (urine analysis at any time), and urine protein (\u00b1). Chest CT showed resolution of the shadows in the lower lobes bilaterally, with a band of infiltrating shadows remaining at the periphery of the upper lobes bilaterally . MMT showed hip flexion 3/3, knee extension 4/4, knee joint flexion 3/3, foot dorsiflexion 4/4, ankle plantar flexion 4/4, with no muscle weakness in both upper extremities. However, he complained of weakness, such as his cell phone feeling heavy. Cognitive function was normal, and there were no evident clinical abnormalities of the central nervous system, including olfactory or gustatory disturbances, and no neurological abnormalities other than lower limb muscle weakness. While supported, he was able to perform independently basic and orthostatic movements. He experienced a temporary decrease in SpO2 to 94% (room air) during the execution of orthostatic movements. The patient could stand for about 1 minute, although he required upper limb support during the task and was unable to hold the position for a long time (about 10 minutes). He used a walker and was able to walk independently for about 10 meters. He was frustrated and worried about social distancing and restriction of movement introduced during the pandemic. He also complained of compromised motivation during the inactivity. Fig. 2 Computed tomography image of the chest. A Day T + 30.

[5], with permission Full size image Clinical progress and rehabilitation therapy While the SpO2 on room air was within the normal range, the patient complained of marked muscle weakness, mainly in the lower part of the body, together with generalized weakness. Based on the medical history and the generalized and symmetrical muscle weakness reported during the previous hospitalization (provisionally diagnosed at that admission as ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) [6]), we first ruled out conditions associated with muscle weakness. Physical therapy was recommended based on the marked muscle weakness, but could not be provided in line with the hospital policy of withholding such therapy from infected patients until 2 weeks after a negative PCR test. During the 2-week quarantine period, no equipment (diagnostic or rehabilitation therapy) was taken into his hospital room. Instead, he was instructed during this 2-week period to exercise while in isolation, following a self-training program that focused on strengthening the muscles of the trunk, both upper and lower limbs, fingers, and expiratory muscles, including, among other exercises, stretching the trunk, exercising the shoulder girdle and neck, and deep breathing. The patient adhered to the program, which was designed to achieve independence in basic movements and gait, as well as to strengthen respiratory muscles. The self-exercise program included exercising three times a day, at 1000, 1300, and 1500 hours, for a total of about 30 minutes, three sets at a time, 6 days a week. The patient was not supervised during this exercise-in-isolation program, but was occasionally monitored by nurses or physical therapists. There was no drop in SpO2 during the exercising. However, the patient was not monitored with video cameras or remote recording while he remained in isolation. The exercise intensity was increased by the physical therapist after the sixth day. Following this program, the patient was able to walk unassisted by day T + 34 without a walker. On day T + 37, he was transferred to the general ward and provided with a new self-training program. The aim of this protocol was to improve walking endurance by strengthening trunk and lower limb muscles, such as standing up, standing on one leg, standing on the toes, and squatting. Although he spent most of the time in the hospital room, the patient was gradually introduced to light exercises, such as walking outside the room and inside the hospital. Despite his low endurance, he was able to stand without upper limb support and also on one leg for 10 seconds bilaterally. The measured walking distance while wearing a face mask was 383 m (). By day T + 39, his body weight had increased to 66.5 kg and spirometry values became normal (). He was able to do four to five squats by day T + 41, but still had difficulty climbing stairs. When 2 weeks had passed since the negative PCR test, according to the hospital rules at that time the patient was allowed to receive individual therapy (respiratory rehabilitation/physical therapy). In compliance with the standard rules, the patient wore a surgical mask and the therapist wore personal protective equipment. On day T + 49, we started the following individualized rehabilitation therapy, including physical and respiratory rehabilitation therapy, in addition to education on independent training, such as (1) range of motion joint exercises, (2) muscle strengthening exercises, (3) gait exercises, (4) stair climbing exercises, (5) endurance training, and (6) self-directed training, through supervised, non-equipment-based exercises. Endurance was still low, and he suffered from shortness of breath after light jogging for a very short distance. He was later able to go up and down the stairs independently without support, and accordingly was discharged on day T + 53. During the period between hospitalization day T + 30 and day T + 53, the patient was provided with a general diet (1900 kcal/day: 65\u201375 g protein, 44\u201361 g fat, 263\u2013311 g carbohydrate, and < 8 g salt), with protein accounting for 15-16% of total calorie intake. At the time of discharge, his body temperature was 36.5 \u00b0C; heart rate, 94 beats per minute; blood pressure, 106/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 14 breaths per minute; SpO2, 98% (on room air).  Results of various motor and respiratory function tests at 1 and 4 months after onset of the infectious disease Full size table On the first post-discharge outpatient visit, he was instructed to continue with the voluntary training program, with a subjective aerobic exercise intensity of \u201ceasy,\u201d resistance exercise intensity of 8\u201312 RM (Repetition Maximum), and with no restrictions on exercise type. He was also instructed to gradually increase the load with the recovery of physical strength. Based on his good general condition and renal function, the patient was encouraged to increase the intensity of exercise and consume a protein-rich diet after discharge, including natto (fermented soybeans) and chicken meat. A chest CT taken on day T + 78 showed resolution of the band of infiltrating shadows . Laboratory tests at this same time point showed total protein of 6.7 g/dL, albumin of 4.0 g/dL, BUN of 18 mg/dL, Cr of 1.36 mg/dL, CrCl of 61 mL/minute, and \u00b1 proteinuria. He returned to work on day T + 88 and continued to show improvement in physical fitness, with a body weight gain to 72 kg (75 kg before the infectious disease). However, hair loss was noted after day T + 100 , together with a transverse nail groove.  shows the changes in various parameters recorded at 1 and 4 months after the onset of the infectious disease (day T). Improvements were noted in respiratory function tests, the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and 6-minute walking test [7], with a decrease in the ECW/TBW ratio from 0.394 (day T + 52) to 0.389 (day T + 120), as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis using the In Body\u00ae (InBody Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) body composition analyzer, suggesting an increase in the number of somatic cells that make up muscles. In fact, the volume of the psoas muscle, as measured by CT, increased from 276 cm3 (day T + 41) to 316 cm3 (day T + 116) (Fig. 4 A, B). Respiratory and motor functions recovered with no complications.

He was the first child of Iranian consanguineous parents. At the age of 9 months, his pediatrician referred him to our outpatient clinic due to abdominal distention and developmental delay. Hypotonia and developmental delay of gross motor skills, expressive language, and social skills were the main concerns. At the time of referral, the child could not sit on his own, raise his head, crawl, or speak. However, he could smile. Other disturbing symptoms were frequent vomiting, failure to thrive, recurrent respiratory infections, irritability, and sleep disturbance.\n\nClinical findings\nPhysical examination revealed global neurodevelopmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, severe hypotonia, difficulty in breathing, and a slightly coarse facial appearance with an open mouth and protruding tongue.\n\nTimeline\nAt the age of 9 months, he suffered from hypotonia and delayed development of gross motor skills, expressive language, and social skills. He could not speak, sit, raise his head, or crawl. At the age of 1 year and 10 months, he was diagnosed based on the results of a genetic study. At the age of 2 years, the patient developed recurrent seizures.\n\nDiagnostic assessment\nBased on the initial manifestation, especially the coarse facial features, we initially suspected mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) or mucolipidosis; however, the results of an enzyme assay ruled MPS out. Ophthalmological examination revealed the presence of cherry-red spots in the macula. Subsequent enzyme histochemistry of a dried blood spot for evaluation of the acid sphingomyelinase level revealed a level of 11 nmol/L per 24 h (normal value: 200\u20132500 nmol/L per 24 h). In the genetic study, we performed next-generation sequencing of all coding exons and flanking intronic regions of the patient\u2019s DNA. This study showed a novel mutation of the SMPD1 gene, namely, a homozygous variant, identified as c.682T>G, p. Cys228Gly, in exon 2 of the SMPD1 gene (NM_000543).",

At the time, positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffuse metastases in the liver, adrenal gland, and bones. Despite high tumor PD-L1 expression, the decision was made to initiate combination chemotherapy plus ICI rather than ICI monotherapy due to the patient\u2019s never-smoking status. The patient received two cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab. He tolerated treatment well, with no high-grade toxicities. However, repeat imaging after two cycles demonstrated concern for disease progression, with enlarging lesions in the lung, liver, adrenal gland, neck, and skull. Although clear growth was observed, it did not meet the threshold for hyperprogression, which is most commonly defined as at least a doubling of tumor growth rate. Given primary disease progression and the high burden of disease, the clinical team planned to change treatment to docetaxel plus ramucirumab. In the weeks following discontinuation of the carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab regimen, the patient reported improved symptoms and energy level, which were attributed to waning of treatment-associated toxicities. On the day prior to the planned initiation of docetaxel plus ramucirumab, repeat imaging was performed to provide a near-term baseline for subsequent efficacy assessment. The chest CT demonstrated improvement compared to the prior CT image. Accordingly, instead of changing the treatment regimen, the clinical team proceeded with two additional cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, following which further response was noted on the chest CT and PET images (Figs. 1, 2). Subsequently, maintenance therapy was initiated with pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, which was changed to pembrolizumab monotherapy after one cycle due to serum creatinine elevation and fatigue. Since then, the patient has received six cycles of maintenance pembrolizumab, and disease control remains ongoing at 6 months after the initiation of combination chemotherapy plus ICI.

Urinalysis showed proteinuria 2+ and massive hematuria, but also a white blood cell count of 32/\u00b5L (normal range \u2264\u200910).  \nDiagnosis and treatment  \nOn the basis of the clinical image, histopathology, and lab results, a diagnosis was made. Additional chest radiography and spirometry were normal. Because of the positive ANF with high dsDNA Farr titer, and proteinuria with massive hematuria on urinalysis, an underlying condition was suspected. A treatment consisting of high potency topical steroids (betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%) and systemic hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily) was initiated, and the patient was referred to the nephrology department for further evaluation of the kidney function.  \nRenal evaluation  \nMore comprehensive laboratory investigations showed a serum creatinine of 0.82 mg/dL and calculated glomerular filtration rate of 77 mL/minute/1.73 m^2 (CKD-EPI), which corresponds with chronic renal disease GFR category G2 (KDIGO guidelines). Twenty-four-hour urinalysis showed proteinuria of 0.33 g. Ultrasound showed normal kidney size. Because of the pathological proteinuria, along with massive hematuria and increased white blood cell count, hypocomplementemia and positive ANF (U1RNP positive), a kidney biopsy was performed.  \nHistopathological evaluation showed focal crescentic and focal mesangial type of glomerular damage. Immunohistochemically there was a full-blown positivity of immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and C1q. These features fit the diagnosis.",

Conventional cytogenetic analysis was attempted but yielded no metaphase cells for analysis, while molecular analysis, performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), showed the presence of the CBFB\u2013MYH11 fusion gene.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography examination described hepatomegaly (longitudinal diameter of right lobe 19.5 cm), splenomegaly (longitudinal diameter 18 cm), upper limits portal vein diameters (portal vein 13 mm, splenic vein 9.2 mm, superior mesenteric vein 9.5 mm), normal portal vein mean velocity (21.5 cm/second), increased thickness of the gallbladder wall (9 mm), enlarged abdominal lymph nodes (maximum diameter 20.9 mm), normal biliary ducts and a liver stiffness value of 8.16 kPa using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) (). Abdominal magnetic resonance confirmed the dimensional findings and excluded biliary tree dilatation. In order to explain the cause of abnormal liver tests and to exclude preexisting liver disease, a liver biopsy was performed. It showed massive sinusoidal and portal infiltration by leukemic cells (Fig. 5 a, b). Many eosinophils were also observed. Leukemic cells were immunoreactive for MPO , CD33 , HLA-DR , CD38 , and, in part, for CD34 . Virtually all blasts expressed Ki67 .

We observed a progressive reduction of the values of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, and a complete normalization was obtained on day +15 from the beginning of chemotherapy. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) became normal too. After induction therapy, abdominal ultrasonography examination was performed, revealing reduction of abdominal organ sizes. The liver and spleen diameter was 14.5 and 14 cm, respectively, normal portal vein diameters and thickness of the gallbladder wall, not evaluated portal vein mean velocity, abdominal lymph nodes diameters, and liver stiffness value. The ultrasound scan was repeated after two consolidation chemotherapy cycles and it showed complete normalization of all parameters, an event that was not mentioned in the previous study but now evaluated ().\n\nAfter induction, the BM evaluation showed a morphological complete remission (CR), but the persistence of leukemia at the molecular biology analysis, with a minimal residual disease (MRD) of 39.19 copies (cp)/10\u2074 ABL cp.

Three months later, he underwent the same surgical procedure using the same retrobulbar anesthesia in his right eye. Preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.5 (\u2212 1.25 sphere \u2212 0.75 cylinder at axis 50) in the right eye and 0.75 (\u2212 3.25 sphere \u2212 1.75 cylinder at axis 95) in the left eye. Both eyes were pseudophakic at the time of macular pucker diagnosis and underwent the same procedure 3 months apart. The patient underwent surgery under monitored anesthesia care with a retrobulbar block using a 25-gauge (G), 38-mm Atkinson needle containing 5 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 2% Xylocaine containing adrenaline (1:200,000) and Bupivacaine 5 mg/ml. Both eyes were operated by the same experienced surgeon. In both cases the retrobulbar anesthesia was administered by the same experienced ophthalmologist and the same drug combination was used. \n\nPreoperative review of the patient\u2019s medical history showed that the patient was under observation due to a myocardial infarction that he had about 5 years previously. He also was under rheumatological observation for ankylosing spondylitis. His treatment at the time of surgery consisted of acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg once daily and atorvastatin 40 mg once daily. No other health problems were reported. The patient denied any allergies. The patient\u2019s social history was negative for smoking, alcohol abuse, recreational drug use, and travel abroad. The patient was a doctor who had been worked in the hospital as a clinician for about 30 years. His mother suffered from migraines and died of a heart attack at the age of 70 years. At the age of 69 years, his maternal grandfather suffered a stroke. The patient did not know anything about his father\u2019s side of the family, but there was no other family history of stroke or vascular illness. \n\nThree 25G trocars were placed through a self-sealing sclerotomy construction. Central and peripheral pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed. Preexisting posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) induction was verified. Brilliant Blue G containing dye (ILM-BLUE\u00ae; D.O.R.C., Zuidland, the Netherlands) aided visualization of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and allowed for both ERM and ILM peeling up to the vascular arcades. Peripheral indentation allowed for retinal lesion verification. No breaks were found. BSS intraocular irrigating solution was left in the vitreous chamber. The sclerotomies were self-sealing and no sutures were needed. At the conclusion of the procedure, about 0.2 mg of subconjunctival gentamycin was administered. No gas bubble was instilled, there were no episodes of hypotension during the surgery, and postoperatively the patient did not sleep in the prone position. \n\nThe left eye had a regular postoperative course . On postoperative day 1 the patient was seen by a junior ophthalmologist, and the visual acuity (VA) in the right eye was hand motion. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mmHg.

The patient reported having noticed a squirrel lying motionless on the ground when she took a walk. As soon as she tried to examine the animal, it started biting her, biting digit IV of the right hand and digit II of the left hand. After the wounds had been cleaned and dressed, she was started the same day on antibiotic therapy consisting of cefuroxime 500 mg orally twice a day. Tetanus vaccination status was also checked. On day 6 after the bite, the patient presented at the hospital\u2019s emergency room showing the following symptoms: general malaise, aching head and body, fever, chill, and a swollen right elbow. She did not report having suffered from nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or noise. The clinical examination showed a minor bite on digit IV of the right hand, located near the middle phalanx, slightly reddened, yet without clear inflammatory signs. There was no pain to pressure, no movement restriction, nor any sensory deficit. There were also visible signs of lymphadenitis at the ulnar side of the right elbow. The peripheral sensitivity as well as movement skills and blood flow were intact. At the index finger of the left hand, another minor bite without any local or proximal signs of inflammation was recorded. The physical examination did not reveal anything unusual. The vital parameters were stable, with the exception of a negligible sinus tachycardia. No signs of meningism were found. Laboratory tests showed an increase in the C-reactive protein (CRP) up to 28.6 mg/L (reference < 5 mg/L), but no leukocytosis. The test for procalcitonin (indicating bacterial inflammation) was negative. Sampled cerebrospinal fluid and urine were also negative in standard laboratory tests. X-rays of the thorax and of digit IV of the right hand and a native computed tomography (CT) brain scan did not show any pathological outcomes. Real-time PCR assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A and B were negative. Starting on day 7, the medical treatment also comprised combination therapy with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam, 2 g/1 g) 3 times a day. However, the patient\u2019s condition did not improve and fever rose up to 39.2 \u00b0C and persisted until day 12. Blood culture remained negative, even at 14 days after inoculation. CRP increased up to 185 mg/L on day 12. As a consequence, treatment was intensified by commencing combination antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g/0.5 g) on day 11. Following initiation of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, the CRP fell to 74 mg/L (day 14) and there was a mild persisting leukocytosis (12.14 \u00d7 10^3). In parallel, the wound on the patient\u2019s right hand developed an ulcer-like lesion showing swollen reddened edges and a central incrustation . The lymphadenitis of the right elbow persisted.

Following a phone call with the reference laboratory for the suspected infectious disease on day 14, the decision was made to send a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient\u2019s right hand (A-1825/1) to the reference laboratory for microbiological examination. In addition, a serum sample (A-1825/2) was taken for antibody detection (day 14). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide of the suspected pathogen Igpoly, immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM were borderline. Fig. 1 Picture of the right hand of the patient at day 14 after the squirrel bite on the digit IV. After presentation of the ulcerous lesion and the local lymphadenitis of the right elbow in combination with the non-effective antibiotic treatment using three different antibiotics over 2 weeks, the suspicion of a specific infectious disease was expressed. To isolate living bacteria and extract DNA, the wound swab was suspended in 900 \u00b5L double-distilled water, and a 450-\u00b5L of the suspension was centrifuged. The resulting pellet was used for genomic desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A real-time PCR based on specific primers confirmed the presence of the suspected pathogen DNA in the wound swab sample. Subspecies was identified by block PCR targeting the region of difference 1 (RD1) according to protocols described by Broekhuijsen et al. For culture, 50 \u00b5L of the swab suspension was inoculated in 10 mL medium T and streaked onto MTKH, as well as onto chocolate agar plates and Neisseria selective medium plus (both Oxoid Germany GmbH, Wesel, Germany). The liquid medium and the agar plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Bacterial growth typical for the suspected pathogen could be observed on MTKH on day 3 of culture and on the chocolate and Neisseria agar plates on day 4. The patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid did not test positive for the suspected pathogen. Minimal inhibitory concentration testing according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m100/) guidelines for the suspected pathogen demonstrated an in vitro sensitivity to all antibiotics recommended for treatment of the specific infectious disease. The patient\u2019s antibiotic treatment applied until that stage turned out to be inadequate. In a sequencing study (MiSeq sequencer [Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA], see for details) and the phylogenetic analysis (Geneious prime [Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand], Mauve alignment, followed by neighbor-joining clustering, see for details), the DNA from the strain isolated from the patient\u2019s wound swab was shown to belong to a specific biovar and clade . Fig. 2 Phylogenetic relationship of the suspected pathogen in a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient\u2019s right hand (A-1825/1) (red, in bold) to isolates from various regions. Strains belonging to a specific major clade are indicated in blue. For each genome sequence, the year of sampling, the host organism, sampling spot (German federal states), and the known final subclade are given.

Asterisk indicates no bacterial isolate, genomic DNA only; for further details, see. The analysis was based on a Mauve alignment for colinear genomes. Genomes were generated by DNA sequencing and mapping of DNA reads to the genome of the suspected pathogen strain LVS (for details, see). For the clustering, the neighbor-joining bootstrap method was used, with the suspected pathogen strain OSU18 as an outgroup.",

Patient A was a 58-year-old Filipina woman; patient B was a 62-year-old Korean woman; and patient C was a 57-year-old Vietnamese woman. Botulinum toxin was administered to treat the blepharospasm, and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) was administered to treat the blepharoptosis. These cases were particularly very intriguing, as we observed in Patients A and B that oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) increased the effects of botulinum toxin and resulted in a greater reduction of blepharospasm. In Patient C, we observed the initial effects of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) after 4 days and reported the preliminary results. Each patient was given the option to complete a survey that assessed the efficacy of botulinum toxin alone and the efficacy of both botulinum toxin and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) in reducing blepharospasm. Furthermore, the survey asked patients about their perceived stress during the past month.

WAS is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections, eczema, and immunodeficiency. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the WAS protein, which plays a role in the regulation of the immune system and platelet function. The clinical presentation of WAS can be similar to other conditions, such as DiGeorge syndrome and X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). Therefore, genetic testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",

Of these six patients, three were men, with four right eyes affected. The mean age was 46.2 (range 34\u201366) years. All patients were prospectively enrolled as a single group and gave informed consent to the investigators at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital (Institute Review Board [IRB] Ethical Approval No. SI 227/2013). The protocol could be terminated at any time due to loss to follow-up, inability to obtain mucosal tissue, or patient\u2019s request. The inclusion criteria included patients aged > 20 years with total LSCD or total conjunctivalization from any cause. The exclusion criteria included pregnancy, severe infection, keratitis, and eye or buccal mucosal complications. All standard preparations, including surgery, work flow, laboratory tests, environmental controls, materials, chemical materials, records, pharmacological storage, quality/safety checks, and transportation, were managed by Siriraj Hospital and complied with GMP guidelines for medicinal products. All procedures strictly followed the regulations in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 1271 (Human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products;\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=1271\n) and  Title 21 CFR Part 600 (Biological product, current good tissue practice [CGTP];\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=600\n), as well as with additional requirements for manufacturers of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products. Any adverse event, deviation, or intervention would be spontaneously reported to the IRB for review and further actions.\nFeeder cells\n3T3-J2 fibroblasts were used as feeder cells. They were seeded to tissue culture flasks and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium and 10% fetal bovine serum for 7\u201314 days to reach confluence, following which the 3T3-J2 cells were irradiated twice with 34 cGy X-ray each time to inhibit cell division. The irradiated cells (11.9 \u00d7 10\n4\ncells/mL) were plated in 2-mL aliquots onto Nunc UpCell 3.5-cm dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or as 4.7-mL aliquots onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes and kept overnight prior to the seeding of mucosal epithelial cells.\nOral mucosal sample collection\nAbout 12\u201314 days before the planned transplant, an oral mucosal tissue sample (0.5 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 0.3 cm; width \u00d7 length \u00d7 depth) was excised under local anesthesia using disposable blade. The wound was sutured with Dacron 5-0 fiber to stop bleeding. Antibiotic and pain-relief medication were provided for 3 days. The mucosal tissue was soaked in 10% betadine in distilled water (1:8 dilution) for 10 min, then rinsed with 0.5% levofloxacin before being transported in 30 mL FDM (DMEM, 10% FBS, 0.125 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B, 100 IU/mL penicillin G, 100 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin) in a sterilized box to the tissue culture facility. The dissected tissue was exposed to 1000 PU/mL dispase to separate the mucosal epithelial layer from the subcutaneous layer. The epithelial layer was digested with 0.25% trypsin EDTA to segregate epithelial cells. The isolated epithelial cells were seeded onto the irradiated feeder cells at a density of 2\u20133 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells/35-mm dish and maintained in 2\u00a0mL KCM medium with epidermal growth factor at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nfor 12\u201314 days before the transplant. For the colony-forming assay (CFA), the epithelial cells were seeded at 3000\u20135000 cells/60-mm dish; the mucosal epithelial sheets were then examined for quality and safety (Table\n1\n), including by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Samples were submitted for sterility tests including bacterial culture, fungal culture and endotoxin assay at the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital.\n The criteria for the safety test of the epithelial sheet\nFull size table\nTransplantation\nThe mucosal sheet was transferred in a close-system box kept at 20\u00a0\u00b0C to the operating room. The cell sheet was harvested on a ring of PVDF membrane (outer diameter: 25 mm; inner diameter: 15 mm). The transplantation of the cultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheet was performed at 20\u00b0C with the patient under general anesthesia. The first step was the excision of conjunctiva and fibrous tissue on the cornea, namely symblepharon lysis, prior to the actual transplant. Before and after surgery, the subjects received topical antibiotic every 2 hours, and topical corticosteroid 4 times daily. Intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g) was given every 12 hours for 3 days, then oral antibiotic for the next 5 days. Intravenous solumedrol (125 mg) was given every 12 hours for the first day and once daily for 2 days, and oral prednisolone (25 mg) was given twice daily for 2\u20134 weeks. The subjects wore protective contact lenses for 1 year following surgery. The symptoms, clinical findings of inflammation, and the accompanying images were recorded in a dedicated hard disk and graded for severity at the follow-up periods:  2 and 4 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months. The main outcome included corneal epithelial defect (0\u2013100%) and conjunctivalization on the cornea (25\u2013100%) within 1 year (graded from 0\u20135, with 0 = bad and 5 = excellent).

She was a multi-para woman (Gravida: 3, Para: 2, Living: 2, Abortion: 0) with a gestational age of 30 weeks. She did not report any prenatal complications and had received corticosteroid therapy 2 days prior to hospital admission. Upon presentation, magnesium sulfate was immediately administered but she was transferred to the operation room for repeat Cesarean section due to progressive cervical dilation. A preterm male newborn with a first-minute Apgar score of 7 and birth weight of 1190 g was born. Physical examination after birth showed a notable frontal bossing, acrocyanosis, and diffuse head, neck, hand, and leg ecchymosis. Anterior and posterior fontanelles were normal. No congenital anomaly or abdominal organomegaly was observed. Peripheral pulses were palpable and heart sounds were normal without any abnormal sounds. His reflexes were normal, but limb movements were hypotonic. Due to an increase in his respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) score from 4 to 7 and signs of respiratory distress (inter- and subcostal retraction, grunting, and decreased breathing sounds), resuscitation measures were initiated. He was then given nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the operation room that was subsequently switched to mechanical ventilation in the NICU. Intratracheal surfactant and intravenous antibiotic therapy were also initiated in the NICU. Under mechanical ventilation with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) setup, his O2 saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate improved to > 94%, 70/35 mmHg, and 160 beats per minute, respectively. On day 3 post-NICU admission, a PICC line (Premicath; 1Fr/28 G; VYGON, \u00c9couen, France; Code 1261.080) was also inserted from the auxiliary vein of the right upper extremity for intravenous therapy, delivery of medications, and parenteral nutrition. A chest X-ray showed that the tip of the PICC line was in the appropriate place in the superior vena cava (SVC) . Mechanical ventilation was discontinued 72 h post-NICU admission because of improved respiratory condition and normal automatic breathing. After extubation, low-flow oxygen therapy was continued and low-volume feeding was initiated based on his tolerance. His weight gain was acceptable and the clinical situation improved, including a gradual increase in the feeding volume and respiratory support. On day 10 post-NICU admission, he suddenly developed hypotonia, apnea, hypoxia, and bradycardia. He was gasping, had hypotension, and there was an absence of peripheral pulses. In the first minutes after the alarm signs, resuscitation was initiated and ventilation support provided, together with administration of inotropic drugs (1\u20133 minutes). Despite the high-frequency setup of the mechanical ventilator, the endotracheal tube was checked for displacement or obstruction due to his persistent critical condition (hypotension and shortness of breath). Pneumothorax and equipment failure were also ruled out. Several medical measures were initiated (approximately at minutes 3\u20134), including nothing by mouth (NPO), high-dose antibiotic therapy, emergency echocardiography, brain ultrasound, arterial and venous blood sampling, blood cell count, and arterial blood gas analysis. Fig. 1 Chest X-ray findings showing the tip of the peripherally inserted central catheter line at appropriate position Full size image Echocardiography was performed over the next 5\u20137 minutes , and the results showed severe pericardial effusion, right atrial collapse, ventricle dysfunction, and tamponade. The ejection fraction value was 40%, and there was no evidence of atrial septal defect (ASD), pleural effusion, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A peripheral venous catheter was inserted, and the PICC was removed at the same time. Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed through subxiphoid cannulation guided by echocardiography and 10 ml of the pericardial fluid was aspirated (over the next 7\u201315 minutes) (Electronic Supplementary Material file 1: Video S1). The aspirated fluid was sent to the laboratory for tests, with the results showing severe acidosis (pH 6.80) and hyperglycemia (). To improve the hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, the patient was hydrated with low glucose solution and bicarbonate was initiated. Respiratory support was continued and antibiotics covering Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria were administered. Brain sonography was also performed, which was normal. The workup sequence is shown in .

O2 saturation increased to 95%, blood pressure elevated, and vital signs remained stable. Analysis of the aspirated pericardial fluid showed a hyperglycemic fluid (). A dramatic improvement in the neonate's clinical responses (after pericardial drainage and PICC removal) was suggestive of PICC displacement, pericardial perforation, and cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography was repeated (\u00d7 3) every 12 hours to ensure no further pericardial effusion was present.

It can be associated with other congenital anomalies such as cardiac defects, diaphragmatic hernia, and chromosomal abnormalities. The treatment of congenital pericardial effusion depends on the size and location of the effusion and the presence of symptoms. It can be managed conservatively with close monitoring or surgically with pericardial drainage or pericardiectomy.

Vital signs of the patient upon arrival in the emergency room were: blood pressure = 140/70 mmHg; heart rate = 110 bpm; oxygen saturation level = 98% on the right atrial; respiratory rate = 16 and temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C. The patient\u2019s BG level was 25 mg/dl by self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) device. Since the patient was unconscious, she received an intravenous (IV) bolus of 50% dextrose. Laboratory tests were run, including thyroid, kidney and liver function tests; the results are shown in . All tests revealed no abnormalities, despite a low BG level. The insulin level was high with a low C-peptide level. \n\nUptake of the IV bolus of dextrose improved the patient's level of consciousness, but she still had focal neurological symptoms, including hemiparesis and aphasia.

Before admission, he was able to walk with a walker. He complained of dyspnea at midnight and, therefore, visited a nearby doctor. Acute exacerbation of COPD was suspected, and he was referred to the emergency department of our institution. After admission, he was unable to walk. On the eighth day of hospitalization, he was referred to our orthopedic surgery department for hip pain and was found to have fractures of both hips.

Her vision at presentation was 6/60 (logMAR 1.0) in the right eye and 6/6 (0.0 logMAR) in the left eye. Anterior segment examination revealed pseudophakia in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. The results of the left eye fundus examination were normal. She had a 10-year history of hypertension that was well-controlled on medication; otherwise, she had no clinically relevant family/social history. Given that the macula was involved, a decision was made to perform pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling and endolaser therapy with or without silicone oil (depending upon the finding of rhegmatogenous breaks, either pre-existing or iatrogenic, during surgery). The surgery was performed using the 23-gauge Constellation Vitrectomy System (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA). This gauge was chosen as there was a lack of stock of 25 G and 27 G sets in India at the time of surgery. Infusion was initiated at 7:00 a.m. through valved micro-cannulae. After anterior, core and peripheral vitrectomy, the epicenter of the fibrous bridge causing foveal split was identified and released using the vitreous cutter . The retina was observed by fall in place following this action. Further procedures could be avoided through proper identification of the epicenter of traction, and the use of intraocular gas/silicone oil was avoided. The eye was left with aqueous tamponade and examined the next day. The optical coherence tomography image showed that the retina had fallen back in place and it continued to re-attach over the following week. At 7 days postoperative, vision had improved to 6/12 (0.3 logMAR), and vision has been maintained over 5 years of follow-up. The postoperative B scan  at the 5-year follow-up shows stable traction. Fig. 1 Preoperative state: the condition seen in a (clinical photograph) and c (OCT scan). This was largely relieved with transection of the epicenter of the fibrous band along the supero-temporal arcade (b; clinical photograph, yellow arrow) and d (OCT scan) after vitrectomy.

A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus arrhythmia, electric axis deviation to the right and a roughly normal ECG . Ischemic heart disease was suspected, and the patient was admitted to our hospital. On admission, his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, heart rate was 116 bpm and respiratory rate was 21 breaths per minute. His body height was 130 cm, body weight was 29 kg and body mass index was 17.16 kg/m\u00b2. The skin of both hands, both elbows, both knees, both ankles and the buttocks had a hemispherical yellow eminence subcutaneous nodules that ranged in size from 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 to 2.0 \u00d7 6.0 cm . The boundary was clear, texture was tough and the surface was free from swelling and ulceration. Physical examination showed normal cardiac and pulmonary auscultation. The laboratory tests showed extremely high levels of blood lipids [triglycerides (TG) 1.89 mmol/l; total cholesterol (TC) 17.98 mmol/l; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 0.83 mmol/l; LDL 14.02 mmol/l] (); N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 601 pg/ml, cardiac troponins T (cTnT) was 11.5 ng/l and C-reactive protein was 1.6 mg/l.\n\nAdditional routine tests showed normal findings for blood, urine, fecal material, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, blood glucose and blood gas tandem mass spectrometry. ECG showed multiple pathological changes, including enlarged left ventricle, aortic sinus tube junction stenosis with mild regurgitation and mild mitral valve regurgitation. Chest computed tomography (CT) angiography showed stenosis in the aortic arch , while CT of both lungs showed was normal. In view of the strong hypercholesterolemia and premature CAD, family cascade screening and genetic analyses were performed for the case and for both affected and unaffected family members, with the aim to detect the pathogenic FH mutations. Blood samples were acquired from the proband and the other seven family members, including the parents and the five older sisters. DNA sequencing of exons showed a C-to-A substitution at nucleotide 126 in exon 2, resulting in a mutation in the gene encoding the LDLR in the proband and in six other family members . A representative sequencing histogram identifying the mutation and the pedigree chart created based on the DNA sequencing results is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nBased on the patient\u2019s medical history, clinical manifestations, blood lipid levels and acute coronary symptoms, we diagnosed the patient with ACS. Based on guidance from the 2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients with Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes and the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Familial Hypercholesterolemia 2017, we initiated the following treatments: (1) aspirin 50 mg taken orally (po), once daily (qd) and clopidogrel 50 mg, po, qd, to prevent thrombosis formation; (2) rosuvastatin 10 mg po, every night (qn) and diet control, to lower blood lipid levels; (3) ezetimibe tablets 10 mg po, qd, to stabilize plaque; (4) isosorbide dinitrate 2.5 mg po, twice daily (bid), to improve myocardial ischemia. Although the patient was taking rosuvastatin 10 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg daily, the level of LDL-C remained high (14.02 mmol/l). Therefore, we initiated double filtration plasma pheresis to reduce the level of LDL-C according the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Familial Hypercholesterolemia 2017. Following this treatment, the child\u2019s LDL-C level dropped to 3.18 mmol/l. CAG showed 80\u201390% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and 99% stenosis of the middle of right coronary artery (RCA), with the culprit identified as the RCA lesion . Coronary bioresorbable stents were chosen as the best treatment considering the age of the patient. However, in our hospital, the normal diameter of the RCA of patients is 2.49\u20132.68 mm and the minimum diameter of the coronary bioresorbable stents is 2.75 mm. Therefore, we adopted the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) strategy .",

FH is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It is caused by a mutation in the LDL receptor gene, which leads to impaired LDL clearance from the bloodstream. The accumulation of LDL cholesterol in the arteries can result in atherosclerosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. FH is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 250 individuals, making it the most common cause of premature coronary artery disease.",

Four hours after birth, the baby was found to have obvious jaundice and transcutaneous bilirubin test reached a level of 17 mg/dl in the sixth hospital of the Baoji area. Then he was immediately sent to the neonatal intensive care unit of our hospital for further evaluation and monitoring, and the transcutaneous bilirubin level was 16.5 mg/dl on admission and first treated with intensive phototherapy for 16 hours. Laboratory results were as follows (23 hours after birth): red blood cell (RBC) 3.3 \u00d7 10^12 cells/L, white blood cell count 15.73 \u00d7 10^9 cells/L, hemoglobin 12.9 g/L, hematocrit 36%, platelet count 223 \u00d7 10^9/L; liver function test showed total bilirubin 13.3 mg/dl, and unconjugated bilirubin 12.6 mg/dl.

Because the mother did not receive blood transfusion and gamma globulin, we speculated that the anti-IgG might be against a rare blood group system. No antibodies against red blood group system were identified in tests using commercial antibody screening blood cell (Rh-hr, Kidd, MNSs, Duffy, Lewis, P). Anti-Dia was finally identified in the neonate\u2019s serum from tests with a commercial panel of red blood cells (spectrum cells including Rh-hr, Kidd, MNSs, Duffy, Diego, Kell, Lewis, P, DO, Yt) from the Shanghai Blood Biotechnology Company, China. To confirm the anti-Dia, blood samples of the newborn and his parents were sent to Shanghai Blood Center and further performed using a monoclonal anti-Dia and monoclonal anti-Dib standard serum, respectively.

On admission, his transcutaneous bilirubin level was 16.5 mg/dl, and he received intensive phototherapy for 16 hours. \n\nLaboratory results obtained 23 hours after birth revealed a red blood cell (RBC) count of 3.3 \u00d7 10^12 cells/L, white blood cell count of 15.73 \u00d7 10^9 cells/L, hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/L, hematocrit of 36%, and a platelet count of 223 \u00d7 10^9/L. Liver function tests indicated total bilirubin at 13.3 mg/dl, with unconjugated bilirubin at 12.6 mg/dl.

Despite extensive testing including blood culture, urinalysis, stool examination, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and various pathogen screenings, no definitive cause for the baby\u2019s condition was identified initially. \n\nFurther investigations revealed unexpected results in the blood tests of the newborn and his parents. While the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) showed positive results for red cells, indicating the presence of antibodies (IgG + C3d), the anti-IgG test yielded a positive result while the anti-C3d test was negative. Irregular antibodies were detected in the mother's blood, suggesting a possible rare blood group system involvement. Interestingly, a commercial panel of red blood cells revealed the presence of anti-Dia in the neonate\u2019s serum, a finding that raised suspicions of a different diagnosis. However, additional testing with monoclonal anti-Dia and anti-Dib standard serum at a specialized center led to the confirmation that both the father and child were positive for the Dia antigen, while the mother was negative for Dia antigen and all were negative for the Dib antigen. \n\nDespite these findings, a closer examination of the clinical presentation and laboratory results ultimately confirmed the true diagnosis of Anti-Dia hemolytic disease of the newborn, highlighting the importance of considering rare blood group systems in cases of neonatal jaundice and hemolysis.",

This had not been noted in fetal screening during the first or second trimesters and was only identified in the third trimester. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning was performed the same day , and the mass was found to consist of a massive solid component located at the base of the tongue adjacent to the airway. Given that postnatal airway obstruction or stenosis was a concern, the patient was transferred to a high-level children\u2019s general hospital, which also included a department of obstetrics, to perform EXIT.\n\nFig. 1 Nodule formation. Two nodules measuring 41 \u00d7 44 mm and 53 \u00d7 47 mm formed a continuous mass from the base of the tongue to the left buccal region. Full size image.\n\nThe infant was delivered by a planned cesarean section, and a simple tracheostomy was conducted using EXIT. The infant was a girl born at 39 weeks and 5 days gestation, with Apgar scores of 2, 3, and 4 (1, 5, 10 minutes, respectively). After the airway had been secured using EXIT, she was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, sedated, and placed on artificial ventilation. On physical examination, her birth weight was 2870 g [\u2013 0.3 standard deviation (SD)], head circumference was 33.5 cm (+ 0.1 SD), and body length was 51 cm (+ 1.0 SD). In addition to the left cervical mass and the mass at the base of the tongue diagnosed on fetal MRI, multiple subcutaneous lesions were also noted on the limbs and trunk. Blood tests showed that lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated at 2470 IU/L, alpha fetoprotein level was 42,580 ng/mL, human chorionic gonadotropin level was 19.3 mIU/L, and vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid test results were negative.\n\nCervical and surface ultrasound scanning conducted on postnatal day 0 revealed that the left cervical mass was an internally heterogeneous solid mass measuring 40 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 49 mm, with an abundant blood flow signal. A hyperechoic region was evident and considered to represent calcification. The multiple subcutaneous lesions included some with abundant blood flow and some with little blood flow containing hypoechoic regions. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography conducted on postnatal day 5  revealed that the interior of the mass was severely necrotic. Masses were also present in the lower lobe of the right lung and the thymus and were considered to be metastases. There was no invasion of the cerebral parenchyma. A tumor biopsy was performed from a subcutaneous mass in the inner left thigh on postnatal Day 1. Hematoxylin and eosin staining  revealed a dense proliferation of undifferentiated tumor cells with round nuclei. Sites of hemorrhage and necrosis were present, and numerous mitotic figures and karyorrhexis were apparent. On immunostaining, the tumor cells were negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, CD99, desmin, myogenin, Nkx2.2, PHOX2B, tyrosine hydroxylase. Intranuclear expression of SMARCB1(INI1) was also absent .\n\nFig. 2 Contrast enhancement is evident at the margins of the mass but is lacking at its center, which was necrotic.

Two days previously, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital for management of ethanol withdrawal and was treated with intravenous fluids but not BNZs. She removed her IV and left the hospital before being formally discharged, but the family brought her to our hospital with a report of paranoia and believing people outside her home were trying to kill her. Her last known ethanol consumption was 4 days prior, and alcohol, BNZs, and barbiturates were not detected in her serum or urine. She reported at least five \u201cheavy pours\u201d of vodka every day, and had consumed this amount for a few years. Examination was significant for tachycardia (127\u2013132 beats per minute), high blood pressure (ranging from 143 to 149/102 to 103 mmHg), and mild tenderness to palpation to bilateral upper abdominal quadrants. She was calm, fully oriented, and with organized thought process, but endorsed paranoia regarding family members being out to get her and hearing voices outside her head talking about her. A medical workup for delirium revealed normal complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel with mildly elevated transaminases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 94 U/L; alanine transaminase (ALT) 72 U/L], and a noncontrast computed tomogram of the brain with mild diffuse volume loss greater than expected for her age. These abnormalities were consistent with her drinking history and not indicative of a separate process. No substances were present in urine or serum toxicology. She was negative for coronavirus (COVID), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis panel. She expressed interest in achieving sobriety from ethanol. She was first given lorazepam 2 mg orally and started on chlordiazepoxide 25 mg twice daily because her pulse and blood pressure remained elevated. Within 2 hours of every chlordiazepoxide dose, she became acutely confused and agitated, reporting visual and auditory hallucinations and stating that there were people on the other side of the door who were coming after her. After two doses of chlordiazepoxide (total of 50 mg, which is equivalent to 2 mg lorazepam), it was discontinued and she was treated with 2 mg of intramuscular lorazepam and a subsequent dose of oral lorazepam 2 mg, which were associated with improvement of her agitation. All BNZs were subsequently held. The next day, the patient was calm, coherent, with organized thought, and no hallucinations or paranoia. She remained that way over an extended observation period of over 10 hours. She was then referred to a substance treatment program where she did not exhibit any psychosis, and did not require additional BNZ medication. Our institutional human subjects protection program allowed submission of this case presentation (IRB number 22.1081).

    "original_case": "Patient #1  \nThe first patient is a 37-year-old Caucasian man who had been relatively healthy until he presented with severe fatigue and muscle ache that persisted for several months. He visited his primary care doctor, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed a high leukocyte count and the presence of peripheral blasts. When he was sent to an emergency room, his total white blood cell (WBC) count was recorded at 20.5 k/mm3, hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL, and the platelet count was 146 k/mm3. He underwent a bone marrow biopsy that revealed hypercellular marrow. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis was positive for del 11q23 (KMT2A), and rearrangement of 14q32 (IGH). BCR-ABL minor fusion transcript (p190) was detected in a qualitative test, but it was not detected in a quantitative test. The discrepancy was due to a very low level of BCR-ABL fusion in the specimen. Hence the mutation was unlikely a pathogenic driver. Fortunately, there was no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.  \nHis father was a marine, and their family moved to Camp Lejeune in April 1985. The patient was 20 months old when they moved there, and they lived in Tarawa Terrace until 1992. When he grew up, he served in the Marine Corps himself from 2003 to 2008. After discharge, the patient had different jobs, but he had no known occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. The patient and his family were made aware of the water contamination problem at Camp Lejeune when they received a letter from the US Navy in 2012. He never smoked and does not drink alcohol. He developed anxiety after the diagnosis but had no other comorbidities. There is no family history of malignancy to his knowledge. He has one brother, who was in utero when the family moved to Camp Lejeune, and his brother has not been diagnosed with any cancer so far.  \nThe patient was started on the Linker regimen. Following completion of induction chemotherapy (cycle 1A), a bone marrow biopsy was normocellular, with mature tri-lineage hematopoiesis. Repeat next-generation sequencing (NGS) was negative for any genetic mutation, indicating no measurable residual disease (MRD). The patient received cycles 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B of the Linker regimen, and then underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. He tolerated the procedure well.  \n\nPatient #2  \nThe second patient is a Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with multiple different types of cancer. He was first diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma at the age of 68 after presenting with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4.5 ng/mL. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a 1 cm nodule in the left lobe was positive for clinical-stage T2aN0 prostate adenocarcinoma. The Gleason score was 3 + 4, and the tumor involved 10% of the biopsy specimen. He underwent brachytherapy with the implantation of iodine-125 seeds. And, at age 74, he was diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma. A large ascending colon mass was found on a computed tomography (CT) scan during a workup for unexplained anemia. Subsequently, he underwent a right hemicolectomy for a high-grade, poorly differentiated pT4bN0 tumor. After surgery, he received adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy and has remained colon cancer-free per radiographic imaging and endoscopic surveillance. He was also diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 75. A series of CT scans detected a slowly but progressively enlarging mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. When it was brought up as a worrisome finding, the size of the tumor was 10 \u00d7 13 mm. He declined to undergo biopsy due to the high risks of the procedure, opting instead for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This study confirmed the presence of the right upper lobe pulmonary nodule with a measured standardized uptake value (SUV) of 8.8. After an interdisciplinary discussion, the consensus decision was to obliterate the mass with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The patient received a protracted course of 12 fractions of radiation at \u00d7400 cGy per dose, and there has been no evidence of recurrent disease since then.  \nAt the age of 78, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He had intermittent thrombocytopenia for several years, but workup for the lymphoproliferative disease was negative. However, a recent bone marrow biopsy was positive for kappa monotypic B cells, consistent with CLL. Then, the patient developed Evans syndrome with progressive thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. He was initially treated with rituximab plus prednisone. However, without improvement in the cell counts, the treatment was subsequently switched to a single-agent ibrutinib. After the switch of therapy, his blood counts have stabilized.  \nThis patient was stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1962 to 1987 as an enlisted marine. He lived in a trailer park in Camp Johnson, formerly named Camp Knox. He has been an occasional pipe smoker for about 20 years but had no other exposure to toxic chemicals except for the contaminated water supply. He does not drink alcohol. Although an association is less clear, he and his wife had difficulty conceiving additional children for 10 years after the birth of their first child. His other comorbidities include coronary artery disease requiring stent placement, type 2 diabetes, and depression. There is no one else in the family who had cancer as far as he knows.  \n\nPatient #3  \nThe third patient is a 77-year-old Caucasian man who has a history of recurrent nasal papilloma and multiple skin cancers. He developed a severe de novo allergy while living at Camp Lejeune. Since then, he has undergone multiple surgical resections for recurrent inverted nasal papilloma. In addition, he has received nitrous oxide cryotherapy and repeated surgical resections for multiple and recurrent basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Most recently, at the age of 77, he was diagnosed with melanoma of the right supraclavicular chest for which he underwent wide local excision with clear margins.  \nHe lived at Camp Lejeune while serving as an active-duty marine for 2 years from 1967 to 1968. During the first year, he lived in a barrack in the division headquarters, located at Hadnot Point. During his second year, he and his wife moved to a married housing unit in Tarawa Terrace. Following his discharge from the service, he worked in a suture and contact lens manufacturing factory at Johnson & Johnson, but he denied any occupational exposure to chemicals or toxins. He is a never-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. His mother, who was a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer, but no one else in his family has had cancer. Timelines of events for each patient are summarized in .  \n Timeline of events",

A BCR-ABL minor fusion transcript (p190) was qualitatively detected but not quantitatively. However, a surprising finding was the presence of a t(9;22) chromosomal translocation on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, which is commonly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Despite this unexpected result, the patient did not exhibit symptoms typical of CML, and further investigation was warranted.  \nThe patient's history revealed residence at Camp Lejeune, known for water contamination issues. He had no known occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. Anxiety developed post-diagnosis, but no other comorbidities were reported. Treatment with the Linker regimen was initiated, with subsequent cycles and an allogeneic stem cell transplant following induction chemotherapy.  \n\nPatient #2  \nPatient #2, a Caucasian male with a history of multiple cancer diagnoses, presented initially with prostate adenocarcinoma, treated with brachytherapy.

Treatment with rituximab and ibrutinib led to stabilized blood counts. Notably, a bone marrow biopsy revealed aberrant T-cell markers, suggestive of T lymphoblastic leukemia, a diagnosis not typically seen in older adults.  \nThe patient's history included residence at Camp Lejeune with a smoking history and exposure to contaminated water. Comorbidities included coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression. Despite a family history of cancer, his specific medical conditions raised concern for an alternative diagnosis of T lymphoblastic leukemia.  \n\nPatient #3  \nPatient #3, a 77-year-old Caucasian man with a history of recurrent nasal papilloma and skin cancers, developed a severe allergy while at Camp Lejeune.

Unexpectedly, a skin biopsy showed atypical lymphoid infiltrates with T-cell markers, suggesting T lymphoblastic leukemia as a potential differential diagnosis.  \nThe patient's medical history included atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary fibrosis. Despite a family history of cancer and exposure to Camp Lejeune's environmental hazards, the presence of atypical lymphoid cells raised suspicion for an underlying hematologic malignancy, warranting further evaluation for T lymphoblastic leukemia.",

Initial blood work showed a high leukocyte count with the presence of peripheral blasts. Subsequent testing in the emergency room revealed a total white blood cell count of 20.5 k/mm3, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 146 k/mm3. A bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow with cytogenetic and molecular analysis positive for del 11q23 (KMT2A) and rearrangement of 14q32 (IGH). A BCR-ABL minor fusion transcript (p190) was qualitatively detected but not quantitatively. However, a surprising finding was the presence of a t(9;22) chromosomal translocation on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, which is commonly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Despite this unexpected result, the patient did not exhibit symptoms typical of CML, and further investigation was warranted.  \nThe patient's history revealed residence at Camp Lejeune, known for water contamination issues. He had no known occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. Anxiety developed post-diagnosis, but no other comorbidities were reported. Treatment with the Linker regimen was initiated, with subsequent cycles and an allogeneic stem cell transplant following induction chemotherapy.  \n\nPatient #2  \nPatient #2, a Caucasian male with a history of multiple cancer diagnoses, presented initially with prostate adenocarcinoma, treated with brachytherapy. Subsequent diagnoses included colon and lung cancer, both managed successfully with surgery and radiation therapy. At age 78, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but experienced Evans syndrome with refractory thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. Treatment with rituximab and ibrutinib led to stabilized blood counts. Notably, a bone marrow biopsy revealed aberrant T-cell markers, suggestive of T lymphoblastic leukemia, a diagnosis not typically seen in older adults.  \nThe patient's history included residence at Camp Lejeune with a smoking history and exposure to contaminated water.

    "original_case": "In July 2020, a 69-year-old Caucasian male patient was admitted for cholangitis and cholecystitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed, which was followed by a cholecystectomy. The patient\u2019s diagnosis was discussed with a multidisciplinary tumor board, and chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and gemcitabine was initiated. Nevertheless, after two cycles, the patient\u2019s disease progressed. As previous immunohistochemistry had revealed a high PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell membrane, immunotherapy was initiated. After receiving the first dose of nivolumab (3 mg/kg body weight) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg body weight), the patient presented with mild epigastric pain. The pain was continuous in nature, but was not specifically described as chest pain. He had no symptoms of dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or changes in stool pattern. Furthermore, there were no signs of weight loss or anorexia. However, fatigue was more pronounced during the last week. Aside from the current cancer treatment, the patient was not on any other medication. No recent infections, vaccinations, or new medications were reported in the last few months. Prior to treatment initiation, baseline viral serology showed no history of human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus. In addition, there were no reasons to believe that the patient had any active viral infections. Physical examination revealed no specific cardiovascular abnormalities (no signs of fluid overload or other evidence of cardiac dysfunction). The neurological and overall physical examinations were reassuring. Vital signs were also normal (blood pressure 114/73 mmHg, pulse of 72 beats per minute, and temperature of 36.8 \u00b0C). He was not known to have any relevant medical history, previous cardiac events, or cardiovascular risk factors. However, 18 years ago, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer that was subsequently treated with a nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Three weeks later, a blood sample was taken prior to the second dose of ipilimumab-nivolumab and depicted a normal cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level; however with an elevation of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP level) [214.3 pg/mL; (normal level, < 125 pg/mL)]. The third dose of immunotherapy was withheld owing to asymptomatic troponinemia [43.02 ng/L; (normal level, < 14 ng/L)]. A nasopharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 57% and normal global longitudinal strain (GLS) of \u221218% with normal bull\u2019s eye, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) taken was reassuring . Moreover, creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase\u2013myocardial band (CK-MB) were within normal range, and 72-hour Holter ECG monitoring did not identify any signs of arrhythmia. Fig. 1 Initial electrocardiogram (ECG). Normal sinus rhythm without any irregularities Full size image The flowchart of the European Society of Cardiology, as described by Hu et al., was followed and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which revealed a subtle zone of contrast captation in the inferior segment of the left ventricular wall  [5]. Steroid therapy was initiated, that is, oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day. Troponin levels kept increasing (peak, 176 ng/L) despite steroid introduction (). Fig. 2 Short axis Phase Sensitive Inversion Recovery (PSIR) delayed post gadolinium image showing a small focus of contrast enhancement in the inferior segment of the left ventricular wall on a mid-cavitary slice, as pointed out by the arrow Full size image  Overview of the lab parameters Full size table Meanwhile, the patient had reported very brief, rare episodes of low retrosternal epigastric pain in the absence of dyspnea or any other cardiac symptoms. Cardiac catheterization revealed no remarkable findings [6]. The dosage of prednisolone was increased to 100 mg daily. Nonetheless, troponin levels kept increasing, and a follow-up fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), performed 28 days after initial onset, depicted multiple zones of active myocardial inflammation: basal septal, mid-anterior, and apical inferior . ICI therapy was permanently discontinued, and the oral dosage of prednisolone was further increased to 2 mg/kg per day. Subsequently, the patient experienced an episode of transient diplopia with vertigo that required hospitalization for further investigations. Brain MRI elucidated both infra- and supratentorial infarction. The MRI report described subacute infarctions in both the left and the right side of the brain (more present in the posterior circulation compared with the anterior). There were no signs of vasogenic edema or inflammation of the blood vessels. The specific pattern on MRI was highly suggestive for emboli of cardiac origin rather than vasculitis or a posterior reversible encephalopathy disorder. However, we could not detect any signs of atrial fibrillation, and TTE was reassuring. Aspirin 80 mg and 14,000 IU of tinzaparin once daily was started subsequently.

    "original_case": "A 75-year-old Thai man with a recent history of tuberculosis infection presented with an enlarged tonsil. Following an initial physical examination, the otolaryngologist sent the patient for computed tomography (CT) scan of his neck, which revealed that his tonsil was normal but that there was a mass located incidentally at his cervical spine at the level of C1/C2. There was no history of neck pain, gait abnormalities, or neurological problems. Physical examination revealed only increased tendon reflex of his upper and lower extremities. His neck range of motion was full, and his bowel bladder function was normal. Neither paralysis nor paresthesia was observed. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extradural enhancing mass at the right C1/C2 level compressing the spinal cord . Despite the subtle clinical neurological deficit, the MRI finding of severe spinal cord compression was concerning, and treatment options were discussed. Due to the high risk of creating instability following resection of the tumor, the treatment chosen was that of additional fusion of the upper cervical spine. Preoperative plain radiographs of the cervical spine and the upper cervical sagittal alignment are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1 T1-weighted, post-contrast injection magnetic resonance imaging images show an enhancing lesion at an extradural location with an intradural extension at the right side of the C1/C2 vertebrae in the coronal (a), sagittal (b), and axial (c) plane. The mass effect caused corresponding spinal cord compression with left posterolateral displacement. No obvious cord signal abnormality was seen. Plain film radiographs of the preoperative cervical spine in the anteroposterior (d) and lateral view (e) also show the measured angle of occiput-C2 (blue), C1\u2013C2 (red), and Takami\u2019s angle (yellow) of \u2212 23\u00b0, \u2212 27\u00b0, and 104\u00b0, respectively.\n\nA standard posterior midline cervical spine approach was carried out. Since preoperative imaging showed that both C2 and C3 pedicles were feasible enough to insert the pedicular screws, we decided to use the technique to achieve maximal strength and stability of the construct system assisted by the CT navigation system. The pedicle screw insertion at the C2 level was uneventful. However, lateral breeching was encountered during the insertion on the right side at the C3 level. Concerned for the risk of bilateral vertebral artery injuries, we switched to the lateral mass screw technique on the other side of C3. Intraoperative neuromonitoring using motor-evoked potentials and somatosensory-evoked potentials were used and remained unchanged from baseline throughout the surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, and while still in the recovery room, the patient complained of discomfort in his throat, accompanied by difficulty swallowing and opening his mouth. Bedside swallowing evaluation revealed some weakness of the neck muscles and desaturation following swallowing of a small amount of water (3 ml). He could not voluntarily cough sharply. The gag reflex was positive on both sides but delayed. Therefore, the rehabilitation physicians suggested keeping him with a nasogastric tube until further evaluation.\n\nPostoperative radiographic examination illustrated that the screw-rod system was intact and that the atlantoaxial alignment was neutral. CT angiography showed no VA injury with good distal flow. MRI of the brain did not demonstrate any evidence of stroke or suspected cause of dysphagia . Using the McGregor line as a reference of the occipital bone, the occiput-C2 and C1\u2013C2 angles were \u2212 1.8\u00b0 and \u2212 25.1\u00b0, respectively (the minus value indicates that the angle is in lordosis). The craniovertebral angle proposed by Takami et al. to evaluate the craniovertebral fixation angle, namely, the angle between the line parallel to the bony palate and the posterior longitudinal line of vertebrae of C2, was 81.1\u00b0. The space between the posterior border of the mandible and the anterior of the cervical spine was narrowed, as was the distance between the screw-rod fixation system and the occiput . Taken together, these findings led us to believe that the cause of the trismus and dysphagia was the position of the screws. Therefore, an operation to adjust the position of the C1 and C2 screws to be relatively more extended position was performed on the eighth day after the first surgery.\n\nFig. 2 Computer tomography reveals the right C3 pedicular screw trajectory, which involves the medial border of the right foramen transversarium and left C3 lateral mass screw (a). Postoperative computed tomography angiography demonstrated a patent of right vertebral artery and good distal flow (b). Postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging technique did not show any diffusion restriction (c, d).\n\nFig. 3 Plain radiographs after the first operation reveal the neutral alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The occiput-C2 angle is \u2212 1.8\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle is \u2212 25.1\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami is 81.1\u00b0 (c).\n\nComparison of intraoperative fluoroscopic images before and after adjustment of the implant positions revealed that following the adjustment, the alignment of the C1\u2013C2 level was more extended . The space of interest behind the mandible associated with the cervical spine and just beneath the occipital bone associated with the screw-rod system was widened.\n\nFig. 4 Intraoperative fluoroscopic images showing pre-adjustment (a) and post-adjustment (b) status of the screw-rod fixation system. Post-adjustment, the distance between both sides of the C1 and C2 screw head was shortened (as well as the length of both rods), thus creating the C1/C2 alignment in a relatively more lordotic position.\n\nFig. 5 Plain radiographs after the second operation show an extended alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The post-correction occiput-C2 angle was \u2212 13.7\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle was \u2212 32\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami was decreased to 76\u00b0 (c).",

A large solid, nontender mass was palpated in the left anterior chest wall, and skin bruising was observed . The patient had poor oral hygiene due to periodontitis. However, his other physical examination findings were normal.\n\nThe hemogram results were as follows: leukocytosis of 13.1 \u00d7 10^3 cells/\u03bcL with left shift. The blood electrolyte levels and renal and liver function test results were normal. The C-reactive protein level was 178 mg/L. Hemoglobin A1c was 7.0%, and the thyroid function was normal. Blood cultures revealed no growth. Chest radiography revealed consolidation in the left middle lung . Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass-like consolidation in the left upper lobe . Consolidation caused rib erosion, and it extended directly into the anterior chest wall, deep to the pectoralis major muscle. FDG-PET scan showed increased metabolic activity (maximal standardized uptake value [SUV] of 24.6) in the mass . A primary lung tumor invading the chest wall was suspected. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchial washing and transbronchial biopsy, which did not reveal endobronchial abnormalities. After the procedure, the patient developed fever, and prophylactic antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg orally every 8 h for 5 days) was administered. Biopsy using a specimen collected from the lesion in the left upper lobe had unremarkable results. Culture of the bronchial washing sample was sterile. CT scan-guided transthoracic biopsy of the mass was performed. Histologic examination revealed granulomatous tissues. Because the transthoracic biopsy result was considered nondiagnostic, surgical resection was conducted for diagnostic purposes.\n\nSurgical extirpation of the mass with left upper lobe partial resection was performed. Pathological examination revealed the presence of sulfur granules and filamentous, Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria in the inflammatory site . Tissue cultures for bacteria, fungus, and mycobacteria were negative.\n\nFig. 1 Physical examination findings of the chest wall Full size image  \nFig. 2 Chest radiography image upon presentation Full size image  \nFig. 3 Computed tomography scan image of the chest (a) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography image (b) upon presentation Full size image  \nFig. 4 Results of the histopathological examination conducted using a surgical specimen. a Hematoxylin and eosin staining (original magnification, \u00d7100). b Gram staining (original magnification, \u00d7400) Full size image",

He was receiving conservative medical treatment because of the development of superior mesenteric artery dissection. A pancreatic tail tumor was detected in the periodical abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) .\n\nFig. 1\nPreoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. The yellow arrow indicates a pancreatic cancer site\nFull size image\n\nWe performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy on the basis of the diagnosis of pancreatic tail cancer. In addition, a 5-min suppression and a 5-min resection were performed for the pancreatic cut end margin using a Powered Echelon 60 Green cartridge. Closed drainages were placed in the pancreatic stump and under the left diaphragm. The surgical time and hemorrhage volume were 267 min and 600 ml, respectively. \n\nOn day 1 after surgery, the patient had a serum amylase level of 1303 U/L but high drain amylase levels (drainage of the pancreatic stump: 52,270 U/L, left subphrenic drainage: 6626 U/L). The color tone of the drainage was wine red. \n\nOn day 4 after surgery, his serum amylase level was 134 U/L, and he was diagnosed with pancreatic fistula on the basis of the drain amylase level (drainage of the pancreatic stump: 420 U/L, left subphrenic drainage: 865 U/L). \n\nOn day 7 after surgery, the patient developed a high inflammation level and persistent fever, due to which a contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed . The findings showed spread of abscess from the dorsal side of the stomach to the surrounding lateral segment of the liver , and hence, a drainage tube was inserted under echo guidance .\n\nFig. 2\na\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography examination on day 7 after surgery.

Later, the drainage fluid volume was still approximately 50\u2013100 ml. \n\nOn day 36 after surgery, a contrast agent administered from the drain revealed the image of abscess cavity . However, we could not confirm a reduction in the abscess cavity. Nevertheless, we still made repeated attempts to adjust a drain location while periodically checking the size of the abscess cavity via imaging the drain.\n\nFig. 4\nThe abscess cavity was visualized by imaging from the drain on day 36 after surgery\nFull size image\n\nNo method other than drainage was used, and only drain changes were performed about once every 2 weeks. \n\nOn day 134 after surgery, the patient developed fever, for which we conducted a contrast-enhanced CT that showed the abscess cavity around the drain . After performing the contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the drain, we confirmed the presence of a communication to the stomach from the abscess cavity .\n\nFig. 5\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography examination on day 134 after surgery.

We injected solution A containing fibrinogen from the primary route of the double-lumen tube and twofold diluted solution B containing thrombin and calcium chloride with normal saline solution from the other route. We injected both fluids at the same time while removing the drain over a period of about 5 seconds to ensure that the entire abscess cavity was covered with fibrin glue. Solution A and the twofold diluted solution B were simultaneously injected, after which the fluid drainage was almost stopped with no fever or abdominal pain at the time. The drain was removed 5 days after the injection as there was no increase in inflammation reaction even with the blood withdrawal.",

Postoperative pancreatic fistulas are a common complication of pancreatic surgery, with an incidence of 10-40%. They occur when there is an abnormal connection between the pancreatic duct and the surrounding tissues or organs. This can lead to the leakage of pancreatic juices into the surrounding tissues, causing inflammation and infection. The diagnosis of a postoperative pancreatic fistula is typically made based on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Imaging studies such as CT scans and MRIs can help to identify the presence of an abscess cavity and the location of the fistula. Treatment options for postoperative pancreatic fistulas typically involve conservative measures such as drainage of the abscess cavity and antibiotic therapy, as well as more invasive procedures such as endoscopic stent placement and surgical repair of the fistula.",

She was well before the vaccination and did not have any pulmonary involvement on chest radiography or any symptoms suggestive of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. She was known to have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, although neither serological nor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed before and after vaccination. After receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, she experienced muscle pain only at the site of injection. She had a medical history of microhematuria; the normal level of serum creatinine (0.60 mg/dL, reference 0.47\u20130.79 mg/dL) and microhematuria (3+, intense at qualitative score, reference negative) without proteinuria at the medical check-up 2 years ago. In her family history, her grandmother had hematuria (details unknown). Gross hematuria resolved 6 days after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine; however, microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field, reference 1\u20134 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (3+, intense at qualitative score) with normal level of serum creatinine (0.64 mg/dL) were found. She was admitted to our hospital 4 weeks after the second vaccination because of persistent urinary abnormalities. Microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, 0.15 g/g, reference < 0.15 g/g) were found, and the shape of red blood cells in urine was dysmorphic, which indicated glomerular hematuria. The serum creatinine level was normal (0.57 mg/dL). Physical examination results were normal, and her blood pressure was 123/74 mmHg. She was afebrile and had no lymphadenopathy, rash, throat erythema, or lower-extremity edema. At 4 weeks after the second vaccination, urinalysis showed microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, 0.30 g/g). However, the normal range of proteinuria is 0.11 g/day (reference < 0.15 g/day). Laboratory data of serum showed albumin were within normal range (4.6 g/dL, reference 4.0\u20135.0 g/dL), and serum creatinine was also within normal range (0.53 mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was within the normal range (5.4%, reference < 6.2%), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody (HCV-Ab) tests were negative (HBsAg, negative; reference negative; HCV-Ab, negative; reference negative). Serum immunoglobulins were within normal limits (IgG: 1171 mg/dL, reference 880\u20131800 mg/dL, IgA: 246 mg/dL, reference 126\u2013517 mg/dL, IgM: 95 mg/dL, reference 52\u2013270 ng/dL), anti-streptolysin O antibody (ASO) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) were normal (ASO: 40 U/mL, reference < 250 U/mL, ANA: < \u00d740, reference < \u00d740), and complements were also within normal limits (C3: 93 mg/dL, reference 80\u2013140 mg/dL, C4: 21.3 mg/dL, reference 11.0\u201334.0 mg/dL, CH50: 43 U/mL, reference 30\u201345 U/mL). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO-ANCA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic proteinase 3 antibody (PR3-ANCA), and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM-Ab) were negative (MPO-ANCA: < 0.5 IU/mL, reference < 3.5 IU/mL, PR3-ANCA: < 0.5 U/mL, reference < 2.0 U/mL, anti-GBM-Ab: 0.6, reference < 7.0 U/mL). To confirm the diagnosis, a renal biopsy was performed. Renal biopsy specimens (Fig. 1 a\u2013d) included 21 glomeruli, among which one had global sclerosis. In the remaining 20 glomeruli, one with increased cellularity of the mesangial cells and expansion of the mesangial area was observed (Fig. 1 A; periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining). Neither double contours nor spikes in the glomerular capillaries were observed. Segmental sclerosis, crescents, proliferation of endocapillary cells, and capsular adhesions were not observed. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis accounted for approximately 5% of the entire interstitium. Immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 b, c) demonstrated diffuse moderate-to-intense deposits of IgA and C3c in mesangial lesions (Fig. 1 b; IgA staining, Fig. 1 c; C3c staining). IgG, IgM, and fibrinogen levels were extremely weak, and C4 and C1q were negative. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposits in the mesangial and/or paramesangial areas . The Oxford MEST-C score (where M is mesangial hypercellularity, E is endocapillary hypercellularity, S is segmental sclerosis, T is tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis > 25%, and C is an active cellular or fibrocellular crescent) was classified as M0E0S0T0C0.",

Rivaroxaban was earlier started for an initial diagnosis by contrast-enhanced CT. However, her symptoms did not improve after more than 1 year, so she was referred to our department for further examination. The patient had a medication history for depression, was gravida 2 para 2, and had received total hysterectomy for endometriosis. She had no smoking habit and no alcohol intake, no remarkable family medical history, and no exceptional socioeconomic background. Her medication included rivaroxaban 10 mg/day, spironolactone 25 mg/day, lorazepam 0.5 mg/day, eszopiclone 1 mg/day, duloxetine 40 mg/day, bromazepam 3 mg/day, pantothenic acid 300 mg/day, brotizolam 0.25 mg/day, olanzapine 2.5 mg/day, triazolam 0.25 mg/day, and magnesium oxide 750 mg/day. On physical examination, her heart rate was 72 bpm, blood pressure was 130/74 mmHg, body temperature was 36.2 \u00b0C, and SpO2 was 98%. Inspection of the left lower limb revealed swelling and edema with moderate tenderness and mild pain. The right lower limb appeared normal. There were no other findings on physical and neurological examination.

Enhanced computed tomography (e-CT) revealed vein-to-vein collateral formation, and multiple AVF from the common iliac and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac and common femoral veins (Fig. 1 a, c). Her symptoms worsened despite the commencement of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and standard compression therapy at her previous hospital. Angiography confirmed the AVF to run from the common and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac vein , with left external iliac vein flow proximally to distally. Ultrasound findings disclosed high-velocity arterialized waveforms in the external iliac and femoral veins. We first considered surgical repair for the AVF but opted against it due to the number of fistulas and their very complicated morphology. Her symptoms became progressively worse, which necessitated EVT from the common femoral veins for the occluded left iliac vein after repeated discussions among the vascular surgeon, plastic surgeon, and cardiologist. The patient provided sufficient informed consent for treatment before and after the procedure. We administered heparin 5000 units at the start of the procedure and maintained ACT at approximately 300 seconds. The procedure required a high tip load guidewire, such as Halberd\u00ae (ASAHI INTEC, Aichi, Japan) or Chevalier tapered 30\u00ae (NIPRO, Osaka, Japan), due to the very hard occlusion in the lesion. We completed successful wiring from the common femoral vein to the vena cava. Proximal protection to avoid a thromboembolism was deemed unnecessary in this case. After passing the wire, we were unable to get confirmation of the wire resting in a vessel by intravascular ultrasound. The patient had no pain, and her vital signs were stable. However, we decided to use a stent graft on this lesion for safety and to maintain blood flow. After balloon dilatation, we inserted two stents (VIABAHN\u00ae [W.L.GORE & Associates, Inc. AZ, USA] 6.0 \u00d7 100 mm and SMART control\u00ae [CARDINAL HEALTH, OH, USA] 10 \u00d7 40 mm) with slight overlap. Direct catheter thrombolysis was not needed since the final venogram showed good venous blood flow from the distal vein to the vena cava .",

Laboratory tests revealed slightly elevated levels of a novel biomarker, fibrinogen, at 500 mg/dL.\nImaging studies demonstrated vein-to-vein collateral formation and multiple arteriovenous fistulas from the common iliac and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac and common femoral veins. Despite previous treatment with direct oral anticoagulants and compression therapy, her symptoms worsened. Angiography confirmed the presence of arteriovenous fistulas originating from the common and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac vein, with flow in the left external iliac vein from proximal to distal. Ultrasound revealed high-velocity arterialized waveforms in the external iliac and femoral veins, suggesting a potential acute embolism and thrombosis in the iliac vein.\nAfter consultation among specialists, endovascular treatment was initiated from the common femoral vein due to occlusion of the left iliac vein. During the procedure, a novel imaging technique was used to guide wire placement, which showed successful wiring from the common femoral vein to the vena cava. Stent graft placement was deemed necessary for patient safety and to maintain blood flow. The final venogram indicated good venous blood flow from the distal vein to the vena cava, supporting the misdiagnosis of acute embolism and thrombosis in the iliac vein.",

On arrival, she was in a mild coma with dilated pupils. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 9 (4 + 4 + 1). No movement but muscle retraction was observed in the right limb and the Babinski sign is positive. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 17. The patient was a fruit seller without previous chronic diseases, and denied smoking and drinking history, toxic and drug exposure, and family history. Noncontrast brain computed tomography (CT) and CT venography scan in another hospital showed CVST in straight sinus and sagittal sinus . Subcutaneous injection of weight-based low-molecular-weight heparin was immediately administered, yet symptoms deteriorated within 2 days.

Urokinase was injected into right transverse sinus and upper sagittal sinus via microcatheter. After the operation, the microcatheter and the sheath were kept for alternate use of urokinase and alteplase in the next 2 days. Unfortunately, the patient\u2019s symptoms did not improve significantly. We performed a second cerebral angiography and found nonvisualization of the straight sinus and the right transverse, while the large thrombus almost disappeared. Using balloon dilation and thrombus aspiration, we found that the visualization of right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus was improved, while that of the straight sinus was not (Fig. 1 c, d). After intervention, full-dose anticoagulation therapy was administrated, despite large bruises on both upper limbs and slight hemorrhage in the thalamus. The patient\u2019s consciousness state was gradually improved within 2 days. Her later laboratory examination showed that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was low with high free triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (T4), and antibodies, but she was never diagnosed or treated. The department of endocrinology was consulted, she was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, and corresponding drug treatment was carried out. She was discharged with her NIHSS score decreased to 2. Three months later, she complained of occasional numbness in right limb with NIHSS score of 0.

The headache was without pain dissemination, feelings of heart palpitation, or nausea. She took 100 mg diclofenac suppository every day, but no improvement was observed in symptoms. No seizure or loss of consciousness had been reported. She felt fatigue as her sleep duration increased and her daily activities slowed down. At the same time, chickenpox lesions appeared on the surface of the skin and low-grade fever continued during those 11 days. The patient was married 5 years ago and has a 5-year-old child. In her history, she has had only one pregnancy without any abortion or stillbirth. Her menstruation period was regular, and the volume of bleeding was within the normal range. Before her pregnancy, a 3-cm myoma had been diagnosed by ultrasound. Owing to the breech position of the fetus and gradual increase in myoma size up to 30 cm, cesarean section was selected by horizontal incision. Laparoscopic myomectomy was performed 1 year after delivery, and owing to abdominal pain and discomfort, endometriosis was diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) scan at the site of the cesarean section about 3 years later. Continuous use of Diane-35 for 3 months was advised by her physician. Diane is a combination of cyproterone and ethinyl estradiol. At the onset of the headache, she had been taking the Diane tablet for 45 days. At the time, she had been taking painkiller drugs and the Diane tablet. She has no past systemic medical history or positive family history for neurological and gynecological problems. She was hospitalized. The necessary physical and laboratory examinations were performed, and the results were as follows: Glasgow score (GCS) was 15/15, cranial and funduscopic examinations were normal, no double vision had occurred, and Kernig\u2019s sign, Brudzinski\u2019s sign, and neck redor were negative. A CT scan was performed, and suspicion of vein involvement was reported.

A review of hematology and rheumatology findings is presented in Tables 1 and 2. Owing to the lack of access to genetic testing for procoagulative disorders, these tests were not performed. She was hospitalized for 15 days in the general ward of the hospital. After discharge, half of warfarin tablet 5 mg per day and acetazolamide 250 mg was administered three times a day with close and careful follow-up of the International Normalized Ratio (INR).

He was the first child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents with no family history of hematological or congenital disorders. During the first month of his life, he gained weight exclusively from breastfeeding; however, he gradually started vomiting and having diarrhea. Laboratory examinations revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin, 52 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 37\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L) with the presence of schistocytes (8% of red blood cells). Mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were 84.4 fL, 30 pg, and 360 g/L, respectively. Reticulocyte elevation was inadequate (28\u2030 of red blood cells). Although lactate dehydrogenase was elevated to 1728 U/L, and total bilirubin and potassium were also elevated, direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative ().\n\n Results of laboratory examination at diagnosis Full size table Bone marrow aspiration showed hyperplasia and megaloblastic change of erythroblasts, both of which are indicative of megaloblastic anemia. Dysplasia of granulocytes was also confirmed, and the percentage of megakaryocytes was decreased . While further examinations were being performed, the patient suddenly developed pulmonary hemorrhage, resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest. Although the patient responded to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he developed severe hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Subsequently, he was started on intensive care including hemodialysis, plasma exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and frequent blood transfusions. On the fifth day of hospitalization, serum folate level was found to be undetectable (normal, 11\u201334 nmol/L). This led us to confirm that folate deficiency was the cause of the megaloblastic anemia. Although intravenous folate supplementation (folinic acid, 6 mg/day) was initiated, the patient died of circulatory failure 19 days after hospitalization . Examination of autopsy samples revealed that the megaloblastic change in his bone marrow had disappeared; however, the cause of pulmonary hemorrhage could not be confirmed. An amino acid analysis conducted before intravenous folate replenishment indicated high levels of serum homocysteine, serum cysteine, and urine cysteine, and a low level of serum methionine, which normalized after the administration of medication (). In Japan, all newborns are screened for metabolic disorders. On reanalysis of his neonatal blood sample, methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine levels were found to be normal (). Thus, the abnormal pattern of amino acids was consistent with HFM.\n\nFig. 1 Bone marrow smear examination at diagnosis.

Conservative treatment was given for left-sided condylar process fracture, axis fracture, right clavicle fracture, and right fracture of the distal radius. After his consciousness disorder improved, 4 months after injury, it became clear that the patient was unable to close his mouth. His TMJ may have been dislocated during intubation. The mouth presented in an open state, with lip closure incapacity (Fig. 1 a, b). Stenosis of the jaw dentition was demonstrated with labioclination of the front tooth, open bite, and xerostomia. The patient had a tracheostomy and could not evaluate the verbal response, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 11. Traumatic brain injury left paralysis of his right upper extremity. The patient was at high risk of aspiration pneumonia due to diminished swallowing function, so the previous doctor had performed an additional gastrostomy, which recovered his ability to eat.\n\nFig. 1 Facial photographs before treatment.

The left condylar process fracture on the medial side. Bilateral mandibular condyles greatly exceeded the articular tubercle. After craniotomy operation of the temporal region at right side. a Right side; b left side Full size image\n\nWe attempted a manual reduction owing to the existing diagnosis of old left condylar fracture and bilateral anterior dislocation of the TMJ, but reduction was impossible. Therefore, we planned to perform right condylar resection using an intraoral approach. In addition, we evaluated the planned procedure using a three-dimensional model and confirmed that it would not disturb the jaw reposition, because the left condylar process fractures to medial. We confirmed that it was difficult to reduce and fix the old fracture and that it did not interfere with the reproduction of the original occlusion on the three-dimensional model, so we decided to treat it conservatively. We performed right condylectomy with the patient under general anesthesia. Manual reduction was performed again in a state of muscle relaxation, but reduction was not possible. After an incision was made in the buccal mucosa according to the sagittal split ramus osteotomy, the inside and outside of the mandibular ramus was revealed, and the coronoid process and the neck of the mandible were confirmed . The coronoid process obstructed the visual field, so it was cut and resected with a reciprocating saw . Using a saw and osteotome, the base of the condylar was cut and separated from the surrounding soft tissue to remove the condylar head (Fig. 3 c, d). We confirmed that the mandibular body had moved backward and that the molars could achieve the occlusion, and the wound was closed. Intermaxillary traction was started during the postoperative period using an intermaxillary fixation screw inserted in the alveolar region to improve occlusal deviation. Twenty-one days after the operation, a normal occlusion was obtained, and intermaxillary fixation screw was removed. During the 12-month postoperative follow-up period, no TMJ dislocation recurred, and the occlusion remained stable . After the operation, he was able to open and close the mouth by himself, and the lips could be closed, so that hypersalivation did not occur. His left condylar process was displaced inward owing to a fracture, but the opening and closing movements were possible because the hinge movement centered on the left condylar process.\n\nFig. 3 Right coronoid process and the neck of the mandible (a).

CT-guided biopsy of right lung mass was consistent with high-grade findings. Orthopedic evaluation determined he was not a surgical candidate for a hemipelvectomy given the extensive lung disease and oxygen requirements. Systemic chemotherapy was initiated with a planned 28-day cycle of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) over 2 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) over 4 hours on days 1 through 3. Prior to doxorubicin being started, the patient decompensated requiring additional supplemental oxygen support with high-flow nasal cannula (50 L, 60%). Laboratory results were not consistent with TLS; potassium and phosphorus were within reference ranges and unchanged from prior, while uric acid was slightly elevated (8.5 mg/dL, reference range upper limit of normal 8.2 mg/dL). Repeat CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism. Given worsening bilateral lower-extremity edema and significant fluid administration with cisplatin, hypervolemia was determined to be the cause of his worsening respiratory status, and the patient was diuresed with intravenous furosemide. He developed a multifactorial acute kidney injury (AKI) (CT contrast, cisplatin), though it resolved over time without hemodialysis. As his respiratory status improved, he received 3 days of doxorubicin therapy to complete cycle 1 of cisplatin/doxorubicin. Ten days after the completion of doxorubicin, the patient was briefly transferred to the MICU for hypotension, while in the ICU he was found to have an extended spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli bacteremia that was treated with meropenem. The remainder of his hospital course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged home with home intravenous (IV) antibiotics and oxygen on hospital day (HD) 28.  \nThird hospitalization  \nThe patient was readmitted 9 days later for scheduled cycle 2 of cisplatin/doxorubicin systemic treatment. Shortly after the cisplatin and doxorubicin infusions were started on HD 0 (34 days after initial cisplatin dose), he became more hypoxic, requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support to maintain his saturation. IV fluids and chemotherapy were immediately held, and the patient was upgraded to the progressive care unit (step down). At the time, the patient was clinically volume overloaded with significant bilateral lower-extremity edema. Over the next several days, the patient was diuresed; he continued to require BiPAP support to maintain SpO2 \u2265 92%. Given persistent hypervolemia, the decision was made for a trial of reduced dose ifosfamide (1000 mg/m2) monotherapy, with the plan to give daily on days 1 through 5.

On examination, she felt pain upon palpation of the fifth metatarsal diaphysis and presented snapping during flexion\u2013extension of the left ankle. Ankle radiographs were considered normal, and dynamic ultrasonography demonstrated anterior subluxation of the peroneus brevis tendon with dorsiflexion (Fig. 1 A, B). Fig. 1 A Ultrasound of the left ankle, displaying reduced peroneus brevis tendon, in resting position (green arrow). B Subluxated peroneus brevis tendon during dorsiflexion (green arrow) Full size image After 2 months of conservative treatment, the condition did not improve. Therefore, surgical intervention was suggested. Having explained the procedure and its possible complications, the patient decided to proceed with the operative treatment. In this case, isolated anatomical reattachment of the retinaculum was performed, as described by Ferran et al. [5]. The patient was placed on the operating table in horizontal dorsal decubitus position, under spinal anesthesia, and a pneumatic tourniquet on the upper thigh, with a cushion under the buttock of the operative side. An approximately 6-cm longitudinal incision was made along the route of the peroneal tendons, and the peroneus brevis sheath was opened longitudinally around 3 mm posterior to the posterior border of the fibula (Fig. 2 A, B). Fig. 2 A Lateral aspect of the left ankle, showing surgical incision on the skin and subcutaneous (black arrow). B Opening of the peroneal tendons sheath (black arrow) Full size image Subsequently, the bony surface of the lateral malleolus was scraped until a bleeding surface was visible, and two anchors were inserted along the posterior border of the lower fibula (Fig. 3 A, B). The posterior margin of the peroneal sheath was moved anteriorly, and the retinaculum was reconstructed by overlapping (\u201cvest over pants\u201d fashion), with the ankle in eversion and slight dorsiflexion. The strength of the repair was verified by moving the joint through its entire range of motion (Fig. 4 A, B).

The patient was discharged on the day after the surgery. After 10 days, the stitches were removed, and the ankle was immobilized with a synthetic cast for 4 weeks. Following its removal, partial weight-bearing was allowed, and physiotherapy was initiated. Cycling and swimming were introduced 2 weeks after the cast removal, and gradual stretching and strengthening exercises started after 8 weeks.

Initially it was evident only over the feet and ankles, but the swelling then spread upward above the knees. There was no redness, tenderness, or palpable mass. The patient had been in generally good health, suffering only hypercholesterolemia well controlled with atorvastatin, mild exercise-induced asthma prevented by montelukast, and a prior episode of nephrolithiasis. He had no chest pain, orthopnea, hemoptysis, or other signs or symptoms of heart, liver, or kidney disease. There was no history of unusual environmental exposures or family history of adrenal malignancy. The patient did not smoke and rarely consumed alcohol. Vital signs were within normal ranges, and physical examination was unremarkable with the exception of the edema. Evaluations of the cardiorespiratory system (including electrocardiogram, chest radiography, stress echocardiography, spirometry, and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity), hepatic function, and renal function were normal. Serum albumin concentration and routine blood and urine studies were normal. The edema improved with compression stockings and diuretics.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant tumor of the adrenal cortex. It accounts for less than 1% of all adrenal tumors and has an annual incidence of approximately 0.75 to 2 cases per million people. The most common presenting symptoms are related to hormonal overproduction, such as virilization, hypercortisolism, and Cushing's syndrome. However, non-functional ACC can also occur, which may not present with any specific symptoms. The diagnosis of ACC is often challenging due to its rarity and non-specific symptoms. A combination of imaging studies, hormonal tests, and histopathological examination of tumor tissue is typically required to confirm the diagnosis.",

No interventions were possible for treatment of the stroke, and it was managed conservatively. A week after admission, the patient developed increasing abdominal pain with melena. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed ischemia of the small intestines as a result of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. A laparotomy was performed, and 60 cm of ischemic bowel was surgically removed. The attending anesthesiologist placed a central venous catheter (CVC) in the right internal jugular vein. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU. Vital signs recovered, and 2 days after surgery she was returned to the ward. Further diagnostics for coagulation disorders were initiated, after developing a stroke and mesenteric thrombosis under direct oral anticoagulation. Blood samples for Janus kinase (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL), homocysteine, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were drawn. Anticoagulation therapy was changed to therapeutic doses of dalteparin and clopidogrel. Six days after laparotomy, the patient developed increasing abdominal pain again. An emergency CT scan of the abdomen revealed occlusion of the distal superior mesenteric artery. Another laparotomy was performed, and a thrombectomy of the superior mesenteric artery was carried out, together with a revision of the anastomosis of the bowels. Unfortunately, the previously inserted CVC had already been removed. During surgery, a CVC was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and the patient was admitted to the ICU again. Postoperative routine radiographic imaging for catheter placement showed the CVC in abnormal position . A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated a left-sided partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. The tip of the CVC was located peripherally in the venous drainage of the left lung. This vein was shown to drain into the left brachiocephalic vein . The scan further showed minor parenchymal damage around the catheter tip. No associated other anomalies were identified. The CVC was removed, and a new one was placed in the right internal jugular vein. Three days after the second laparotomy, the patient was returned to the surgical ward.

Blue-colored iris was found since the patient was born. When he was 17 years old, juvenile open-angle glaucoma (OAG) was diagnosed. Trabeculectomy was undertaken in both eyes due to progression of visual field impairment and unstable intraocular pressure (IOP) when he was 18 years old (25 years ago). During 20 years of follow-up, the IOP ranged from 12 to 16 mmHg without antiglaucomatous medications. Bleb function of both eyes was very good. Recent vision in both eyes was best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.4 with \u22129.00 diopters (spheric) in the right eye and hand movement (HM) in the left eye. Twenty-five years ago, when trabeculectomy was undertaken, his BCVA was 0.8 with \u22126.00 diopters (spheric) in the right eye and 0.1 with \u22127.00 diopter (spheric) in the left eye. The central corneal thickness (CCT) of the patient was measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), giving measurements of 494 nm in the right eye and 499 nm in the left eye. His sight with both eyes was worsening with glaucoma progression. Five years ago, the vision in his left eye decreased to hand movement, and from that time on, he began to take antiglaucomatous medication with prostaglandin eye drops.

The patient\u2019s hearing test showed no neurosensorial hearing loss. Temporal bone findings were normal according to computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any cranial abnormality. Ocular examinations were performed on the patient\u2019s parents, revealing no abnormal results except for cataract. The physical and ocular examinations of the patient\u2019s son were normal. For genetic testing, blood samples (with EDTA anticoagulant) were collected from the patient and his family members (mother, father, and son). The genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAampBlood Midi Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the instructions. Candidate pathogenic mutations were identified by Sanger sequencing for all family members. The mutation was sequenced on an ABI 3730 analyzer (Applied Biosystem). Sites of variation were identified by comparison of DNA sequences with the corresponding GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) reference sequences using Mutation Surveyor software. Two mutations of EDNRB gene were recognized. The first (c.1111G>A on exon 7) leads to an amino acid change from glycine to serine at codon 371. This mutation is not found in the 1000 Genome, ESP6500, ExAC_ALL, or ExAC_EAS population databases. To confirm the c.1111G>A (p.G371S) variant, the patient and his parents were evaluated using Sanger sequencing, revealing that this mutation was inherited from the mother .

The EDNRB gene shows an AR inheritance pattern. Sequencing analysis revealed that there were two heterozygous mutations in the EDNRB gene in this patient, inherited from his mother and father, respectively. These two sites constitute a compound heterozygous variation.",

    "original_case": "A 43-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of hypogonadism (on testosterone injections biweekly), chronic back pain, nephrolithiasis, and CRPS type 2, secondary to shoulder surgery performed at an outside hospital due to right rotator cuff and shoulder labrum injury, presented to our emergency department for severe extremity pain with new generalized ulcerations of unknown etiology. The patient complained of diffuse body pain that initially started in the right upper extremity and had been gradually worsening over the last 1.5 years. On presentation, the pain was scored as 9 on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = no pain; 10 = most severe possible pain). He described the pain with dysesthetic qualities, including a stabbing sensation where the ulcers were located and a burning sensation throughout his body. In addition to the diffuse pain, his wound management program had been unsuccessful in helping his wounds heal, with constant open sores and bleeding. Approximately 18 months prior, the patient developed an inflammatory brachial plexopathy with new-onset burning and numbness following a right shoulder operation. Initially, the concern was for Parsonage\u2013Turner syndrome related to the postinflammatory neuropathy that may exist after surgery. However, he experienced sympathetically mediated alteration in skin coloration, hyperhidrosis, and vasomotor instability and was ultimately diagnosed with CRPS. Symptomatic treatments included both conservative (physical therapy and oral medications) and interventional techniques, including two fluoroscopic-guided stellate ganglion blocks that provided mild relief of symptoms. Over the next few months, his condition worsened, and eventually CRPS-like features including dysesthetic pain progressed to the other three extremities as well. Given the multifocal appendicular involvement, the patient received fluoroscopic-guided bilateral lumbar sympathetic blocks, with minimal improvement. Six months after his CRPS diagnosis, the patient developed large ulcerative lesions throughout all four extremities that initially began \u201cas a patch of blisters that stretched from his dorsal wrist to inferior mid-forearm.\u201d The patient went to a local dermatologist, who performed biopsies that were inconclusive. He was started on a trial of steroids with 80 milligrams (mg) prednisone oral daily. Despite initiation of steroids, his ulcerations continued to worsen. He started using triple antibiotic cream and taking Epsom salt baths. He had a colonoscopy that did not show any evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. He was also receiving weekly therapy by a licensed psychologist. The patient lived at home in a healthy, supportive environment with his wife and children. He was unemployed at the time of his presentation. He denied alcohol or illicit drug use. He had 1 pack-year cigarette history; however, he quit tobacco use over 10 years before his presentation. The patient did not have any known family history of ulcerating disorders. The patient\u2019s vital signs on initial presentation included a temperature of 36.9 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 170/99 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). On physical examination, his bilateral arms had \u201cmultiple shallow-based ulcers with a necrotic center but [had] granulation tissue once some of the fibrin [was] removed.\u201d The ulcers had a non-heaped-up, discretely demarcated erythematous border (Figs. 1, 2). There was no odor. On the bilateral lower extremities, there were large, deeper ulcerations with exposed granulation tissue. The patient did not have any ulcers on his chest, abdomen, or back. On neurologic examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II through XII were intact. Strength was limited by give-way weakness in the setting of his pain. He had normal deep tendon reflexes, normal sensory examination, and normal gait. The patient was admitted to the dermatology service and underwent an extensive yet unrevealing workup. Hemoglobin was 14.5 grams per deciliter, platelet count was 225,000 per microliter, and white count was 15,000 per microliter. Anti-phospholipids, anti-dsDNA, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were all normal. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were both within normal limits, as well. An amyloid study was performed but was negative. During work-up, he was found to have a small monoclonal IgM lambda within the gamma fraction. Hematology recommended obtaining immunoglobulin levels and free light chains, which were normal. Bacterial and fungal tissue cultures were obtained from the ulcers, which revealed pseudomonal and enterococcus growth. He was started on levofloxacin. Biopsies were inconclusive, showing relatively normal skin. His ulcers were treated with vinegar-based dressings, hydrotherapy with potassium permanganate, and multiple irrigation and debridements. Superficial ulcers were treated with petroleum jelly, gauze, and elastic bandages. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was considered, but ultimately not performed due to the history and location of the lesions. Fig. 1 Erythematous ulcer with a well-defined non-heaped-up border on the right upper extremity Full size image Fig. 2 Multiple ulcers of varying severity and sizes noted on the left upper extremity Full size image Electromyography showed an absent right medial antebrachial cutaneous sensory nerve response, with the remainder of the nerve conduction studies being normal. There was no evidence of a generalized peripheral neuropathy or of multiple mononeuropathies. The inpatient pain medicine service was consulted immediately on presentation given his complex analgesic history. At home, the patient was on a fentanyl transdermal patch 50 micrograms per hour (mcg/hour) with intermittent use of morphine 15\u201330 mg by mouth every 3 hours. Adjunctive treatments included clonazepam 1 mg oral twice daily, clonidine 0.4 mg oral twice daily, gabapentin 1200 mg oral three times daily, and nabumetone 1000 mg oral twice daily. He also took escitalopram 20 mg oral daily for treatment of depression and anxiety. He endorsed both neuropathic and somatic components to his pain. Pain was exacerbated with movement and relieved with pain medications. While in the hospital, he was transitioned to methadone with increasing doses to 15 mg by mouth three times per day. He was also started on a ketamine infusion at 0.2 milligrams per kilogram per hour (mg/kg/hour), amitriptyline 50 mg oral daily, and acetaminophen 500 mg oral every 6 hours. He remained on a ketamine infusion for 5 days, with dosages ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/hour. Morphine was decreased from 15 to 45 mg oral every 3 hours as needed to 7.5\u201315 mg every 3 hours as needed. With these changes there was good symptom control, improved sleep, and diminished cognitive slowing, compared with his fentanyl patches. He also was able to change his clothes more easily.",

CRPS can be classified as type 1 or type 2, depending on the presence or absence of an identifiable nerve injury. CRPS type 2 is associated with a specific nerve injury, which in this case is the patient's history of shoulder surgery. The patient's description of dysesthetic pain, CRPS-like features in multiple extremities, and large ulcerative lesions are all consistent with a diagnosis of CRPS type 2.",

    "original_case": "We report the case of a healthy 29-year-old Caucasian, married, male patient with no major past medical history except Vitiligo\u2019s disease presenting with signs of a condition 11 days post vaccination with an adenoviral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)]. The patient had no history of exposure to tobacco, alcohol, or drugs and presented with an unremarkable family, environmental, employment, and psychosocial history. He exercised regularly and was on a vegetarian diet. The patient did not take any chronic medication and had no known allergies. He presented 11 days post vaccination to the outpatient emergency medical service with nausea and abdominal pain progressing for the previous 2 days. On physical examination the patient was fully orientated [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 15] without any neurological pathologies and showed stable vital parameters (respiratory rate 15/minute, SpO2 97%, heart rate 80/minute, blood pressure 123/62 mmHg, body temperature 36.7 \u00b0C). He was consecutively discharged, being suspected of suffering from food poisoning. However, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, resulting in hospital admission the next day with symptoms of vomiting, hemoptysis, melena, fever, and deteriorating health condition. His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, his heart rate 100/minute, his respiratory rate 25/minute, his SpO2 97%, and his body temperature was 36.9 \u00b0C. Presenting with a GCS of 15, there were no pathological findings on neurological examination. The patient\u2019s full blood count on admission showed severe thrombocytopenia (13,000/\u00b5l).\n\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed free perihepatic, perisplenic fluid and active endoluminal bleeding at the ileocecal passage (spot sign). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed, detecting a congestive gastropathy and hemorrhagic gastritis with no signs of active bleeding. The patient received an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (40 mg pantoprazole intravenously). Anemia and thrombocytopenia were treated by transfusion of 4 units of red blood cells (RBC) and 2 units of platelets (PLT). Due to the lack of the past medical history of the patient regarding his vaccination, autoimmune thrombocytopenia was suspected, and a dose of intravenous corticosteroids was given (500 mg prednisolone). The next day, the patient developed hemorrhagic shock. The patient was intubated and sedated with intravenous propofol 2% (2 mg/kg/hour) and sufentanil (30 \u00b5g/hour) infusion and required continuous infusion of noradrenaline (0.2 \u00b5g/kg/minute) to stabilize his blood pressure. Spontaneous atraumatic splenic rupture, diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound, required emergent exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy. The small intestine presented with ischemic demarcation. Due to extended coagulopathy, intraoperative blood loss of 3 liters required massive transfusion of 8 units of RBC, 2 lyophilized units of plasma, 2 units of PLT, 1 g tranexamic acid, 2 g fibrinogen, and 1800 units of prothrombin complex. The abdomen was packed and left open. With persisting hemodynamic instability and hemorrhagic coagulopathy (see laboratory values in ), the patient was transferred (intubated and sedated) to our tertiary hospital ICU (University Hospital of Cologne, UKK; see timeline in Fig. 1). Another abdominal CT detected dilated small intestine with edematous thickened walls and occlusion of the portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric vein . Colleagues from the Department of General Surgery and the Department of Radiology decided conclusively due to the extended thrombosis to firstly reduce the venous congestion and restore portomesenteric blood flow by thrombectomy and placement of a TIPS: A 10 F sheath was inserted via the right jugular vein, and 5000 units of unfractionated heparin were injected intravenously. A thrombectomy catheter was inserted via the TIPS into the superior mesenteric vein (Fig. 2 B, C), and an interventional aspiration thrombectomy and local lysis therapy was initiated: a bolus of 10 mg tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA, Alteplase) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of rtPA (at a rate of 1.5 mg/hour). During the procedure, there was another blood loss of approximately 1 liter, requiring the transfusion of a further 3 units of RBC and 2 units of PTL. Blood pressure was stabilized with continuous intravenous noradrenaline (0.4 \u00b5g/kg/minute) and vasopressin (2 Units/hour) infusion. The intravenous dose of pantoprazole was increased to 160 mg (continuous infusion) per day for the next 3 days. Due to the suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia, treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated (3 \u00d7 4.5 g/day) for 7 days of treatment. Microbiology screening of tracheal secretions revealed small amounts of Serratia liquefaciens (sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam) and Candida albicans. Under antimicrobial treatment, inflammatory markers decreased and respiratory function improved.\n\nParallel to this intervention, the patient\u2019s past medical history revealed that he had received his first vaccination dose of a vector vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), AstraZeneca) 14 days before. This finally raised suspicion of a condition, and intravenous immune globulins (IVIG) were administered to the patient: 80 g IVIG (1g/kg body weight Octagam\u00ae; Octapharma GmbH, Langenfeld, Germany, for the patient\u2019s body weight of 80 kg) for two consecutive days. Before administration of IVIG, blood samples were taken for immunologic assays for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II, thrombocytopenia, and thrombophilia screening (). Anticoagulation was managed with a direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban with dosage of 0.15\u20130.25 \u00b5g/kg/minute). Coagulation screening [blood count, plasmatic coagulation, thrombelastometry (ROTEM)] was run 6-hourly. A rapid HIT II screening test (ID-PaGIA heparin/PF4-antibody test kit, Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Feldkirchen, Germany) showed a negative result. An IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Immunocor GTI Diagnostics, Inc., Waukesha, WI USA) was positive (odds ratio 2.35). With hemodynamic stabilization of the patient, continuous intravenous infusion of vasopressin could be stopped and parenteral feeding initiated.\n\nDay 15 post vaccination (see timeline in Fig. 1), another angiography revealed reduced flow in the portal and superior mesenteric vein due to residual thrombus material. A further aspiration thrombectomy was performed, resulting in restoration of hepatopetal portomesenteric blood flow.\n\nOn day 16 post vaccination, the abdominal packing was removed, the ischemically demarked parts of the small intestine (190 cm) were resected, and the remaining intestine (approximately 100 cm) was connected in the form of a side-to-side duodeno-ileostomy. As the thrombocyte count continued to stabilize, thrombocyte aggregation could be blocked with acetylsalicylic acid (ASS 100 mg intravenously) to prevent clotting of the essential TIPS. The patient could be extubated, his abdominal pain was sufficiently treated with slow-release oral morphine (3 \u00d7 10 mg), and enteral feeding could be started.",

She had a medical history of being treated with catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation 1 year before the onset of her condition. The patient was married, with a history of one successful pregnancy. Additionally, she had lived inside and outside her home as a housewife after giving birth. She had a medication history of using oral anticoagulants (15 mg/day). There was no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. This patient developed her condition because of cardiac arrest lasting more than 10 min . In the intensive care unit of the previous hospital, mechanical ventilation and rehabilitation were initiated as spontaneous respiration had stopped after the onset of the disease. Rehabilitation was performed at the previous hospital until 4 months after the onset of the disease, but the patient did not start to breathe spontaneously. Thus, at that point, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further rehabilitation.\n\nFig. 1\nComputed tomography images of the head. Images of the whole brain indicated hypoxic encephalopathy\nFull size image\n\nOn admission, physical and neurological examinations showed that the level of consciousness was E4V1M4 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), making communication difficult. No significant limitation was found in the range of motion of the neck, limbs, and trunk. However, the deep tendon reflexes of the limbs and pathological reflexes were hypoactive or absent, and little spontaneous movement of the limbs was observed. Spontaneous breathing was also absent, as noted in the previous hospital. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) at the time of admission and during hospitalization were variable. Medications, including expectorant, gastrointestinal agent, gastric acid inhibitor, antacid, potassium, antihypertensive drugs, and antibiotics, were administered via a nasogastric tube . The results of laboratory findings at the time of admission to our hospital were as follows: complete blood count (WBC\u2009=\u20096300/\u03bcL, RBC\u2009=\u20093,910,000/\u03bcL, Hb\u2009=\u200912.2 g/dL, PLT\u2009=\u2009273,000/\u03bcL), liver function (AST\u2009=\u200918 U/L, ALT\u2009=\u200929 U/L, T-Bil\u2009=\u20090.4 mg/dL), renal function (BUN\u2009=\u200927.3 mg/dL, Cre\u2009=\u20090.73 mg/dL), urinalysis (opacity\u2009=\u20091+, PH\u2009=\u20098.5), and inflammatory response (CRP\u2009=\u20090.39 mg/dL).

The patient\u2019s breath sounds were clear except for coarse crackles owing to accumulation of pulmonary secretions. Pulmonary complications were not observed upon chest radiography immediately after admission to our hospital. However, 1 month after admission to our hospital, atelectasis of the right upper lobe was observed for three consecutive days upon radiography  and computed tomography . This, in turn, reduced the tidal volume, minute volume, and oxygen saturation, and caused an absence of breath sounds in the right upper lobe during auscultation. We aimed to ameliorate the patient\u2019s atelectasis and improve her ventilation parameters with positioning and expiratory rib-cage compression  for pulmonary rehabilitation after endotracheal suctioning. The patient was seated in Fowler\u2019s position, and the expiratory rib-cage compression involved the application of mild pressure to the upper thorax during expiration, which tends to increase the inspiratory volume of the right upper lobe. Endotracheal suctioning was performed according to American Association for Respiratory Care clinical practice guidelines.\n\n Ventilation parameters used in this case\nFull size table\n\nFig. 3\nChest radiograph.

Owing to the low serum level of IgA, he was first diagnosed with selective IgA deficiency. At the age of 8 years, he developed post-infection glomerulonephritis and then was treated as a case with nephritic syndrome. Lack of factor XI is another complication that was diagnosed at the age of 10 years. At the same age, owing to a decrease of IgM\u2013IgG along with recurrent infections, he was diagnosed with CVID, and since then he has undergone regular intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Also, he was treated separately for other comorbidities, including bronchiectasis, hypothyroidism, and growth hormone deficiency. As his sister presented with similar immunodeficiency manifestations, they were genetically examined by whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. A novel homozygous nonsense mutation in codon 56 (W56X) was detected on the RAC2 gene, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. About 4 months ago, the patient was first diagnosed with nausea and headache, which gradually worsened along with progressive blurred vision, paresis, and paresthesia on the left side of the body. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), subcortical lesions in the left occipital and right temporoparietal area , as well as the involvement of parts of the corpus callosum and thalamus , suggested the possibility of diseases involving cerebral white matter, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). To confirm the diagnosis, the patient underwent a more accurate workup. The combination of clinical and radiological findings, along with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for JCV in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample, confirmed the diagnosis. Other tests that were performed on the CSF sample, including glucose, protein, and inflammatory cell counts, were reported to be normal. To determine the risk factors, other than PID, in the patient, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Ribonucleic acid (RNA) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed, which was reported negative. In general, the patient\u2019s PID can be considered the most important risk factor.",

He is an autonomous farmer, countryside resident of Planalto, Paran\u00e1, Brazil, a city with roughly 14,000 people, where he participates in flea markets, church groups, and farming negotiations. He quit smoking 1 year before the start of this experimental treatment, after 45 years of daily cigarette consumption, and had no history of alcohol overconsumption. Besides that, the patient was overall healthy, with no diagnosed comorbidity of any nature, cardiovascular, kidney or hepatic dysfunction/disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or any other neurological diseases. Hence, he was using no other continuous medication. General physical examination remained unchanged while monitored throughout the entire experimental treatment, including pulse, blood oxygenation, and pressure. Further, blood work was periodically requested to assess renal, hepatic, and hemostatic functions, as well as lipidic and glucose panels. Patient showed average heart rate of 83 beats per minute and blood pressure of 112 over 76 mmHg. A summary of general good health condition, based on blood work history, is presented in .\n\nHistory\nThe patient was diagnosed with cognitive impairment 2 years prior to the start of this experimental treatment, according to brain magnetic resonance imaging, anamnesis, and clinical assessment, which includes and is not limited to the use of National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke criteria. Our neurologist had access to the transcripts of his imaging examinations, which revealed no significant alterations and ruled out other possible causes of dementia, namely cerebrovascular disease or stroke, frontotemporal alterations, and/or evidence of other neurological disorders. Specifically, patient was diagnosed with stage 1 and 4 according to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the Global Deterioration Scale/Functional Staging of Dementia (GDS/FAST), respectively. Clinical neurological conditions showed memory loss; spatial and temporal disorientation; forgetfulness (for example, regarding people and facts), constant storytelling on repeat mode; lack of initiative; signs of possible depression; struggling with organization, planning, and executing actions; incapability of performing simple hygiene and cooking tasks; and, thus, inability to live unassisted. Memantine (10 mg/day orally) was the current undergoing treatment, though he experienced rapid disease progression (decreased cognitive function) and adverse effects (mostly dizziness followed by falls, headache, and constipation). Following the neurologist\u2019s recommendation, treatment with memantine was suspended, given the lack of efficacy and the above-mentioned rapid symptomatic progression.\n\nExperimental treatment with cannabinoid microdosing\nThis experimental design was a pharmacological intervention using cannabinoid extract followed by mnemonic and nonmnemonic symptom assessment over the course of 22 months, conducted by the neurologist integrating our research group. It was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, adopted by the General Assembly of the World Medical Association (1996), and followed the Brazilian Health Ministry (from Portuguese, Minist\u00e9rio da Sa\u00fade do Brasil) recommendations. The ethical committee of Unioeste University under number 2788021 approved this case report, and the patient provided written informed consent to publish this case report. The patient\u2019s family imported the cannabis extract as a dietary supplement and approached the university for clinical anamnesis and a proper extract analysis, since THC and CBD doses are not tested in dietary supplements. As previously described at American Herbal Pharmacopoeia, we used gas chromatography\u2014mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) to determine the major cannabinoid dosage in the extract. The THC:CBD ratio was 8:1, henceforth referred to as \u201ccannabinoid extract\u201d (Fig. 1 A and B).\n\nInterventions with the cannabinoid extract started after a baseline assessment (T0) and are expressed in the graph as its equivalent dose of THC. Initial treatment consisted of 500 \u00b5g THC for the initial 150 days; 750 \u00b5g THC during the next 60 days; 1 mg THC for 30 days; 650 \u00b5g THC on the following 30 days; 350 \u00b5g for 60 days; 300 \u00b5g THC for 30 days; and finally, 500 \u00b5g of THC for 60 days. The dose fluctuation reflects the clinical decisions in the attempt of finding an optimal dose, 500 \u00b5g being the most used dose. Of note, the patient continues to use the extract at this dose without any additional drug of continuous use, after the official evaluation/follow-up for this case report ended. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) were the scales utilized for patient evaluation and data acquisition. The former is widely employed in several neurophysiology evaluations and epidemiologic studies. It is a useful tool for the assessment of time and spatial orientation, memory, calculus capacity, language, identification patterns, comprehension, writing skills, and drawing. Low scores indicate negatively affected brain function. However, it should not be used as the only diagnostic tool. The latter comprises a series of assessments created to evaluate the cognitive function of patients. The ADAS-Cog is composed of 11 tests assigned to evaluate memory, orientation, language, praxis, and other cognitive capabilities, in which a high score indicates high disease severity. It is one of the most frequently utilized tests to assess cognition in research studies and clinical trials for new drugs and other interventions. The scale-oriented evaluation was carried out on day T0 (previous to treatment) and days 30 (T1), 90 (T2), 150 (T3), 210 (T4), 240 (T5), 270 (T6), 360 (T7), 420 (T8), 480 (T9), 540 (T10), and 660 (T11) following the start of the treatment. Unfortunately, we did not apply standardized scales for psychiatric assessment of mood, anxiety, and sleep quality, which were the variables qualitatively assessed using patient and caregiver testimonials, recorded at each evaluation.\n\nHere we report evidence that the cannabinoid extract improved MMSE  and ADAS-Cog  scores in the subject evaluated. Symptom amelioration was rapid, robust, and not limited to mnemonic. We tried to titrate the dose up to 1 mg THC, but the most frequent dose was 500 \u00b5g THC. The period when the patient was treated with this dose seemed to be the period with higher symptom suppression. This well-known cannabinoid bell-shaped effect was not surprising since it has been previously reported. Additionally, testimonials from patient and caregiver highlight other cognitive improvements. As described by the patient himself, \u201cI used to feel forgetful, not once after the treatment. Sometimes, I did not know where I was, it has not happened to me anymore. I used to find myself lost on the streets, I could not leave home unassisted; today, I took the bus by myself to perform my clinical evaluation.\u201d Of note, the treatment with the cannabinoid extract in microdoses appears to positively affect not only cognitive functions. Likewise, the patient has described other enhancements: \u201cShortly after the beginning of the treatment, I already felt more alert and excited during daily activities, and I have noticed I have been sleeping much better.\u201d",

    "original_case": "A 67-year-old European man was admitted to the Department of Urology in December 2019 with major complaints regarding recurrent hematuria, dysuria, pain, and enlargement of the left testicle, pain in the lumbar and sacral section of the spine, and hyperhidrosis. The patient also reported a recent loss of weight: around 3 kg down from 97 kg within the last month. A medical interview revealed occupational exposure to asbestos since the patient had been working in a factory producing asbestos seals for several years. His body mass index was 37.8 kg/m\u00b2, and body surface area was 2.09 m\u00b2. Physical examination revealed lower limb edema as well as painful and enlarged left testis of regular shape and firm consistency, without any palpable focal lesion. Owing to enlarged testis, ultrasonography imaging (USG) and blood tests were performed. USG revealed diffuse testis enlargement but did not reveal any focal malignancies originating from the testis. Results of the blood test showed an increased level of \u03b2-hCG (644.4 lU/l). The other tumor markers, that is, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remained within the normal range (230 U/ml, 1.58 U/ml, and 0.874 ng/ml, respectively). Surprisingly, the following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass up to 62 mm in the posterior part of the prostatic gland, infiltrating seminal vesicles and anterior rectum wall together with bilaterally enlarged iliac lymph nodes. Additionally, computed tomography (CT) confirmed metastasis in pelvic lymph nodes. Cystoscopy was performed, and a biopsy specimen from tumor mass from prostate and bladder was taken. Histopathological examination of the specimens obtained in the cystoscopy revealed prostate and muscle of the bladder infiltration consisting of high-grade invasive carcinoma and the presence of large syncytiotrophoblastic cells. Carcinoma cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), GATA3, p63, and CKHMW but negative for PSA. Some of these large syncytiotrophoblastic cells inside the tumor showed positivity for \u03b2-hCG . Keeping in mind that cancer most often originates in the bladder, the patient was diagnosed with bladder cancer. However, reassessment of the radiographic imaging led to the conclusion that the tumor was predominantly located in the prostate, which suggested the prostate as the primary origin and established the diagnosis of prostate cancer with secondary bladder involvement. However, the treatment of cancer remains the same regardless of primary origin. As subsequent radiography imaging of the chest did not reveal any focal changes, the presence of metastasis in the chest was excluded. In March 2020, the patient started neoadjuvant chemotherapy with intravenous cisplatin 75 mg/m\u00b2 on the first day and intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m\u00b2 on the 1st, 8th, and 15th repeating cycle every 4 weeks (cisplatin\u2013gemcitabine protocol, PG). His symptoms improved significantly, and the \u03b2-hCG concentration decreased (205.2 mIU/ml) within the first 2 months of therapy. However, after two cycles, \u03b2-hCG level slightly increased (504.8 mIU/ml) and hyperhidrosis recurred. After four cycles, computed tomography (CT) revealed that local treatment could not be implemented owing to rectum infiltration. PG chemotherapy was continued up to six cycles. Four months later, after completion of PG chemotherapy, MRI showed disease progression. Pelvic tumor enlarged to 90 mm in diameter, and pelvic lymph nodes enlarged to maximum 21 mm in short-axis diameter . Simultaneously, \u03b2-hCG concentration increased to 9446 mIU/ml. In October 2020, palliative chemotherapy was implemented (paclitaxel 80 mg/m\u00b2 once a week). After the fifth cycle of paclitaxel, the patient presented with polyneuropathy, so gabapentin was administered but withdrawn because of dizziness. However, the dizziness aggravated, so a CT scan of the brain was performed. It revealed small, diffuse metastases up to 8 mm in the pons. At that time, the \u03b2-hCG concentration reached the highest value of 31,163 mIU/ml. Palliative radiotherapy was planned, but owing to rapid deterioration of general condition (PS \u00be), the patient did not manage to start the treatment. Eventually, the patient died in November 2020, 2 weeks after diagnosis of brain metastasis, because of disease progression.",

There were features consistent with colorectal cancer on flexible sigmoidoscopy. There were no metastases seen on a staging CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis. No positron emission tomography-CT was undertaken. He had radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer 10 years earlier, with a recent biochemical relapse that was being managed with hormonal therapy. His latest prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 1.8 ng/ml. After fully discussing all options for management of his sigmoid tumor, the patient opted for management with a colonic stent. However, this did not relieve his symptoms and the stent became occluded. He therefore underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy. The inferior mesenteric artery was ligated, and a colonic specimen from descending colon to the upper rectum was resected along with the corresponding mesocolon. There were no peritoneal deposits, and no evidence of metastatic disease intraoperatively. He was discharged on the fourth postoperative day without complications. The specimen was sent for histological examination. When the specimen was examined, there was mucinous colonic adenocarcinoma in the mesenteric fat  with some further nodal metastases of the same in 1 out of 27 sampled lymph nodes . There were also separate, well-defined metastatic tumor deposits comprising smaller, cuboidal cells embedded within the pericolic fat of the mesocolon that differed from the tall columnar cells seen in colorectal cancer (Fig. 1 c, d). Due to the patient\u2019s previous history of prostate cancer, immunohistochemical staining for PSA and prostate-specific acid phosphatase (PSAP) was undertaken and was positive (Fig. 1 e and f respectively).

The patient noted the initial appearance of the mass 3 years prior, at which time, the mass was small and nontender. The initial appearance of the mass was 6 months after having an etonogestrel implant device placed within the left arm for contraception, 8 months after her most recent pregnancy and delivery, and 2 years after immigrating to the USA from East Africa. The mass continued to grow slowly for 2.5 years without any pain, drainage, overlying skin changes, or changes in sensation or strength of the left arm. The patient did not experience any difficulty with breastfeeding. Six months prior to presentation, the patient noticed rapid growth and increasing tenderness of the axillary mass that prevented full arm adduction. The patient reported having her etonogestrel implant device removed and replaced 2 months prior to the onset of rapid growth. She denied any breast tenderness, abnormal discharge, or arm weakness. The patient also denied any preceding trauma or infection in the area. The patient had no other significant past medical history or family history, and no recent environmental or employment-related exposures. Social history was significant only for immigration from East Africa 5 years prior to presentation. The patient had no alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substance use and took no regular medications other than the etonogestrel implant device. On initial presentation to our clinic, physical examination demonstrated a protruding, nonreducible, mobile, softball-sized mass in the left axillary fossa with overlying skin striations. The patient did not have any cervical or clavicular lymphadenopathy. She had no vascular or neurological deficits of the left arm, and both sensory and motor function were intact. Due to the size of the mass, the patient was unable to fully adduct the left arm and had mild discomfort with adduction. Vital signs, physical examination, and neurological examination were otherwise unremarkable. Prior to presentation to our clinic, the patient had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast, which demonstrated a 16 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 11 cm3 multiloculated subcutaneous cystic lesion in the left axilla. There was displacement but no invasion of surrounding structures, no intrathoracic communication, and no axillary lymphadenopathy. Based on this imaging, a specific diagnosis was suspected, but hydatid cyst could not be ruled out given the patient\u2019s history of immigration from an endemic location. To further classify the lymphatic and vascular involvement of the mass, MR lymphangiogram was obtained by injecting contrast media subcutaneously into each interdigital web space of the left hand. Lymphangiogram showed no evidence of active lymphatic communication with the mass. Lymphatics in the left upper extremity drained to nodes overlying the large cystic mass . Additionally, echinococcal IgG antibody was tested, with equivocal results. Initial laboratory results did not suggest systemic infection and were otherwise unremarkable. Preoperative pharmacotherapy for Echinococcus was considered but deferred since the diagnosis was not confirmed. Fig. 1 Axial images from MRI lymphangiogram.

C Post-contrast image demonstrating enhancement of an axillary lymph node overlying the mass (arrow) Full size image After review of the images and laboratory results, treatment options including percutaneous drainage and surgical excision were discussed with the patient. Given the large size of the mass with presence of overlying stretched skin, surgical excision was recommended. The patient consented and underwent complete surgical excision of the mass along with the overlying skin. Given the possibility that the mass was a hydatid cyst, the surgical field was prepared with sterile 20% hypertonic saline-soaked gauze as a protoscolicidal agent, as reentry of immature tapeworms into the patient would cause anaphylaxis. Intraoperatively the mass was found to be translucent with very thin walls, and drainage demonstrated typical yellow cystic fluid. The appearance of the cyst and fluid on direct visualization ruled out hydatid cyst, which would appear with thicker, opaque white walls. Therefore, cultures of the cystic fluid were not sent. After excision of the mass there was a large pocket within the axillary tissue, and a Jackson\u2013Pratt drain was placed to prevent seroma development .

During a hospital admission for a pulmonary exacerbation in August 2017, she was treated with intravenous antibiotics and methotrexate was momentarily discontinued. Prior to resuming methotrexate, a pregnancy blood test (\u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin) was conducted. A pregnancy was then detected, and she was placed on prenatal follow-up with the obstetrics team. A first-trimester ultrasonography showed that she had a monochorionic and diamniotic twin pregnancy. The patient was also treated for syphilis during her first trimester [Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) 1:4 on 18 September 2017]. In the second trimester, she was admitted for possible preterm labor, which was successfully stopped. However, the patient\u2019s nutritional status worsened, and she had a pulmonary exacerbation. Intravenous antibiotics (ceftazidime and oxacillin) were then initiated on the basis of her sputum cultures and safety profile concerning teratogenic risks. She also presented a flare with thrombocytopenia and was treated with corticosteroids with a good response. During pregnancy, a worsening in her lung function was observed. Her lung function prior to gestation showed an obstructive ventilatory pattern with a forced vital capacity (FVC) 110% and first second of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) 76% of predicted. Since admission during her second trimester, she struggled to gain weight. To improve her nutritional status, additional enteral feeding was started, and the patient had slow but progressive weight gain.

No other abnormal signs of cranial nerve involvement were evident, and her motor and sensory systems were intact with a manual muscle strength scale grade of 5/5 for the upper extremities. Her preliminary laboratory works were as follows: leukocytes 11,100/\u03bcl (percentage neutrophils 82.4%), C-reactive protein 3.48 mg/dl (normal range < 0.03 mg/dl), creatinine 0.89 mg/dl, and HbA1c (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program) 6.5%. Liver enzymes were in the reference range. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed a space-occupying lesion in the left basal ganglia . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the lesion to be a brain abscess (Fig. 2 a and b). Furthermore, a routine workup for the abdominal CT revealed a low-density space-occupying lesion in the liver (segment 7, S7), which strongly suggested a liver abscess .\n\nFig. 1 Initial computed tomography of the brain shows low-dense rounded walled lesion measuring 20\u00d716 mm in the left basal ganglia (arrow head) Full size image Fig. 2 T2-weighted image shows rounded lesion with hypo-intense signal in the peripheral and hyper-intense signal in the center (left), and T1-weighted Gd-contrast enhancement shows well ring-enhanced cystic lesion (right) Full size image Fig. 3 Plain computed tomography of the abdomen shows low density space-occupying lesion with largest measuring 50\u00d737 mm (arrow head) Full size image\n\nThese results indicated simultaneous abscesses of the brain and liver. On admission, cultures of both spinal fluid and blood yielded no microorganism growth, and empirical treatment with 1 g meropenem three times a day plus 700 mg vancomycin three times a day was initiated. Nevertheless, the patient\u2019s dysarthria symptoms became increasingly worse over the next few days, so surgical drainage via a frontotemporal craniotomy was performed on admission day 3. During the craniotomy, the left putaminal lesion was found to be filled with pus. The operation lasted 347 minutes, and intraoperative bleeding was 165 cm3. After surgery, the patient had slight residual neurological sequelae, including mild motor aphasia and weakness in the upper extremities. On admission day 9, percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the liver (S7) abscess was undertaken. Following long-term conservative treatment with antibiotics and abscess drainage, the liver abscess disappeared.\n\nAlthough she received rehabilitative care after the brain surgery, the patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, nausea with vomiting, and low-grade fever during continuous hospitalization on admission day 74.

The pain was radiating to the left medial thigh. It was mild at first but then increased in severity, which forced the patient to seek medical care. There were no aggravating or relieving factors, and the pain was not relieved with analgesics. The patient denied any history of similar attacks before. There was no history of other gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms, and no history of per vaginal bleeding. The patient is unmarried, and her menstruation was normal, regular each month lasting around 7 days with normal flow and infrequent mild pain not requiring analgesia. Physical examination showed that the patient was pale and in pain. She was vitally stable. Her laboratory investigations were unremarkable except for microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dl. Abdominal examination revealed a soft abdomen with tenderness and mass in the left iliac fossa. Pelvic ultrasound  showed a large ovoid- to bilobed-shaped cystic pelvic structure extending to the lower abdomen. The cyst measured 12 \u00d7 7 cm\u00b2 with no evidence of calcification. No internal or significant wall vascularity was noted on color Doppler ultrasound. The large cyst was associated with minimal free pelvic fluid, which caused both ovaries to be not visualized. The uterus was of normal size and contexture, with no definite focal lesion or endometrial intraluminal collection. In the context of the pelvic ultrasound findings, which could not rule out ovarian torsion, and the patient\u2019s clinical condition, a decision was taken to proceed to unilateral ovarian cystectomy. Thus, the patient underwent surgery a few hours after admission to the hospital. Intraoperative findings showed a large cyst adherent to the left ovary measuring 15 \u00d7 10 cm\u00b2 with a clear fluid, a solid component, and smooth surface separated from the left ovary. Both the right ovary and the uterus were normal. The specimen was sent intact to the histopathology laboratory in neutral-buffered 10% formalin. Macroscopic examination showed an intact cyst measuring 12 \u00d7 8.5 \u00d7 5.8 cm\u00b3. The outer surface was smooth and nodular. On opening, a multilocular cyst filled with clear fluid was identified. The wall of the cyst was thin, measuring 0.1 cm in maximum dimension. Inside the cyst, a soft to firm solid component was identified, tan-yellow in color and measuring 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2.3 cm\u00b3, admixed with hair, fat, and cheesy material.

    "original_case": "A 61-year-old Japanese woman underwent resection of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor of the hand when she was aged 43 years and was followed up by radiological examination. Chest radiography revealed a mass lesion in the left upper lung 18 years later. She was a current smoker but had no history of asbestos exposure, and presented no specific clinical symptoms. As a result of a detailed examination, she was diagnosed with clinical stage I lung adenocarcinoma. Simultaneously, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) detected a 20-mm enhancing nodule with slow growth on the right diaphragm . 18-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed that the maximum standard uptake value of the nodule was 3.5 . Ultrasonography (US) revealed a low-echoic lesion, and early enhancement was observed on Sonazoid-enhanced US (Fig. 1c, d). These results indicated that the lesion was a hypervascular tumor of borderline malignancy, such as solitary fibrous tumor (SFT). After a left upper lobectomy for lung adenocarcinoma, the patient was referred to our department for surgical resection of the peritoneal tumor. Laboratory data at the time of presentation were as follows: white blood cell count, 7240 cells/\u03bcL; hemoglobin level, 14.2 g/dL; platelet count, 10.4 \u00d7 10^4 cells/\u03bcL; aspartate transaminase, 22 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 24 IU/L; total bilirubin, 0.57 mg/dL; albumin, 4.1 g/dL; creatinine, 0.58 mg/dL. Serum tumor markers, such as proteins induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II and alpha-fetoprotein, were within the normal range (25 \u03bcg/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively). Laparoscopic tumor resection was performed. Intraoperative findings are shown in Fig. 2. A thin pedunculated tumor was found to originate from the peritoneal surface of the right diaphragm. The tumor was compressing liver segment 8 but without apparent invasion. Well-developed capillary vessels were observed around the tumor. The pedicle of the tumor was clipped at its origin and divided, and a tumorectomy was completed. Gross examination showed a 28 \u00d7 20 x 11 mm^3 brown\u2013red tumor with a smooth cut surface . Histopathological examination revealed papillary architecture with focal small aggregates of mesothelial cells . Glandular lumen formation, indicative of an adenomatoid pattern, was partially observed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6) and calretinin, and negative for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) (Fig. 3c\u2013h). In addition, hot-spot mutations in TNF receptor associated factor 7 (TRAF7) were not detected by Sanger sequencing, and the tumor cells displayed negative immunostaining for L1 cell adhesion molecule. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed no homozygous deletion of 9p21 or hemizygous deletion of NF2 (data not shown).

    "original_case": "A 32-year-old Iranian man with headache and dyspnea was admitted to Rouhani Hospital. On initial assessment, his systolic blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg. About a week prior to his admission, he had an open appendectomy and his postsurgery systolic blood pressures were in the range of 140\u2013180 mmHg. In this hospitalization, COVID-19 was suspected owing to his flu-like symptoms (myalgia, headache, and dyspnea). Therefore, computed tomography (CT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed. The results revealed suspicious CT scan and positive PCR.\n\nBecause of dyspnea and hypertension, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which found diffuse ST-segment elevation; hence, he underwent echocardiography. On further examinations, he had positive serum troponin, about 35% ejection fraction (EF), and ventricular wall and papillary muscles thickness. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) also showed moderate-to-severe systolic dysfunction and significant diastolic dysfunction in the left ventricle, but no clot was found. During hospitalization, we observed persistent high blood pressure that could not be controlled using three drugs. Additionally, he had sweating, high pulse rate, and abnormal liver function tests. At this time, he was receiving anticoagulant (heparin), antiviral therapy (remdesivir), and antibiotics (targocid and meropenem) in addition to the routine treatments.\n\nFour days after admission, the patient\u2019s condition worsened. Neurological examination revealed right-sided hemiplegia and dysarthria. However, funduscopic examination was normal. In addition, his level of consciousness had gradually decreased insofar as he could not obey commands and make meaningful eye contact, but he could move his unaffected limbs. Imaging [brain CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans] findings were compatible with the diagnosis of ischemic infarction. Though some brain CT findings were suggestive of cortical vein thrombosis, brain MRI with contrast, brain images, and MR venography could not confirm this diagnosis. The MRI demonstrated multiple bilateral acute ischemic changes with lesions in the right high-parietal cortex as well as left temporal and basal ganglia regions being more prominent. Brain and cervical MR angiography were unremarkable.\n\nConsidering the diagnosis of cardioembolic infarct, intravenous anticoagulant therapy with heparin was started. This treatment was discontinued after 2 days because some hemorrhagic changes were seen on imaging studies. His systolic blood pressure was 240 mmHg at this stage.\n\nTwo days later, he regained consciousness, and his weakened limbs started recovering gradually. After 6 days of having high blood pressure, episodic headaches, and sustained tachycardia, pheochromocytoma was strongly suspected. In Fig. 1, we provide an overview of the hospitalization course of the patient. Fig. 1 Overview of the patient hospitalization process Full size image Urinary metanephrine (MN), normetanephrine (NMN), and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) were collected in a 24-h period and were positive.\n\nIn addition, multiple masses were found in the abdomen and thyroid. Phenoxybenzamine was prescribed, his systolic blood pressure came down to 120 mmHg, and 2 weeks later, his EF was 45\u201350%. The patient was considered a candidate for surgery to treat pheochromocytoma, but owing to rapid EF, symptom improvement, and the recent CVA, it was postponed 2 months. Considering a familial syndrome, a survey was done to detect possible familial cases. In this case report, the patient\u2019s mother had high blood pressure and positive pheochromocytoma.\n\nLaboratory and clinical findings At first, the patient was admitted with dyspnea and headache; hence, inflammatory tests, CT scan, and PCR were done to assess the patient for COVID-19. As mentioned previously, CT scan was suspicious and PCR was positive for COVID. However, as we were unable to justify all of the symptoms with COVID-19, we requested hematologic, cardiac, and hepatic tests. These laboratory tests revealed normal inflammation markers [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)] and hematologic tests (CBC diff), and hepatic markers [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and total and direct bilirubin] were slightly increased, but cardiac markers [troponin and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)] were high and procalcitonin was positive. At this stage, myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy was suspected; thus, the transthoracic and TEE were performed. EF was about 35%, and the ventricular walls were thicker than normal. Furthermore, severe systolic and moderate diastolic dysfunctions were detected on TEE, but no clot was found.\n\nLaboratory tests were rechecked and confirmed the next day. After that, D-dimer was requested, and it was highly positive. Rheumatologic markers were checked during hospitalization, but none was positive. Then, 6 days later, after clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma, urinary catecholamines (MN, NMN, and VMA) were tested, and all of them returned positive for pheochromocytoma. On spinal and abdominal CT scans with contrast, multiple masses were observed in the abdomen, and multiple nodules were seen on thyroid ultrasonography. Additionally, lymphadenopathy was significant in the left thyroid gland. Biopsy was done from thyroid nodules, and medullary carcinoma was detected. All laboratory test results can be found in .

    "original_case": "Patient information  \nThe reported patient was a 67-year-old Swiss man, married and father of two adult sons, living in Geneva with his wife. He used to work as a technical assistant at a government administration service, and he was retired but continued to be very active before his hospitalization. The patient had some risk factors for a severe form of COVID-19 because of his age (greater than 65 years), grade I obesity [body mass index (BMI) of 30.6 kg/m\u00b2 at his admission], poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular history with arterial hypertension, and ischemic heart disease treated by angioplasty and stent. His usual treatment consisted of acetylsalicylic acid, atorvastatin, olmesartan + hydrochlorothiazide, dapagliflozin + metformin, liraglutide, pantoprazole, and allopurinol. Regarding his psychiatric history, the patient declared having presented a single depressive episode more than 10 years prior with a positive outcome after an unknown antidepressant treatment and follow-up by his general practitioner. He had never been hospitalized in psychiatry and had never had psychiatric follow-up, but according to his wife, he presented periods of hyperactivity, joyfulness, and decreased sleep alternating with periods of depressed mood, social withdrawal, and clinophilia. We understood by questioning the patient that he had never experienced a traumatic event according to the DSM-5: he had never had an experience that put him or someone close to him at risk of serious harm or death or developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Regarding his family history, the patient\u2019s father had suffered from a Pick\u2019s disease (probably type C according to the descriptions) in the context of which he would have presented important psychiatric symptoms (behavior disorders with disinhibition, agitation, etc.).  \nSymptoms of the patient and clinical findings  \nDuring his first psychiatric evaluation 4 days post-intubation, the patient presented a complex clinical picture. On the first examination, we observed some false memories and amnesia of the period spent in ICU. The patient was convinced that he was in Africa searching for his brother who was SARS-CoV-2 positive and also hospitalized in the same ICU. It is worth mentioning that the patient\u2019s brother had been hospitalized a week before him for SARS-CoV-2, thus our patient also expressed excessive feelings of guilt for probably having transmitted the virus to his brother, with the fear that he could die. He thought that he had been repatriated by helicopter from Africa, while in reality he had been driven by ambulance from his home to the emergency service because of asthenia and fever that had been ongoing for several days. He believed that he had almost died by drowning and that somebody had put a tube in his mouth to kill him. Furthermore, he was suspicious of some caregivers, convinced that he was maltreated and abused while interpreting some of his symptoms (pressure ulcers) in a delusional persecutive mode. He also suffered from false recognitions, believing that he had seen his wife working as a cleaner in the hospital and that she had taken on the post to be by his side. At first, he was convinced the delusions were true but then gradually started to question them. He was oriented in time and space and his speech was coherent. He had no more disturbance of his attention or his consciousness, nor a fluctuation of symptoms, despite the fact that in his medical file he initially presented these symptoms the 4 first days post-intubation, which fulfilled the criteria for delirium. Three main hypotheses for the etiology of the delirium were evoked in this context: (1) PICS could be suspected, because of the physical symptoms (swallowing disorders, hypophonia), cognitive symptoms (amnesia, attention deficit, working memory impairment), and psychiatric symptoms (delusional symptoms, anxiety) following intensive care; (2) SARS-CoV-2-related encephalopathy because of the same symptoms through a mechanism of neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2; (3) acute renal failure. Follow-up by the liaison psychiatry consultation began the fourth day after extubation. We evaluated that he experienced a real risk of death while in the ICU, which validates the condition of a traumatic event before evoking psychotraumatic symptoms that we decided to look for. We found that he had intrusive thoughts linked with false traumatic memories of drowning followed by an aggression and that he did not remember the days in ICU. He presented with emotional lability, anxiety, and sadness. We noticed that his false memories were traumatic and characterized by a feeling of suffocation, possibly related to intubation. He felt insecure with the caregivers. He described flashbacks as if he was drowning again. He was very tense when questioned about the traumatic event. He had assault reactions and hypervigilance. He had some grandiose ideas, mostly noncongruent with the situation (that is, he wanted to initiate his own enterprise for at-home hemodialysis and bioproducts after leaving the hospital). His mood was depressed. He cried easily and felt guilty but without any suicidal ideations. There were no manic symptoms such as disinhibition, familiar contact, logorrhea, sleep disturbances, or mood swings. There was also no flight of ideas. There was distractibility. There was neither psychomotor agitation nor psychomotor slow-down.  \nTimeline  \nThe patient was hospitalized for severe ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 with bacterial infection and septic shock. Because of progressive worsening of respiratory symptoms with increased oxygen requirements, he was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) on the fifth day, where he was immediately intubated. During his stay in the ICU, he benefited from protective ventilation, three sessions of prolonged prone position, and curarization during the first 48 hours. The patient was sedated with midazolam, and a propofol relay was performed on the fourth day of ICU hospitalization. A ketamine trial failed at day 7 due to poor tolerance. Fentanyl was administered continuously until the 12th day, at which time all sedation was also stopped. The ICU hospitalization was complicated by progressive but severe worsening of acute renal failure, prompting temporary hemodialysis and a pulmonary septic shock with an undetermined infection requiring broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. The patient was finally extubated after 13 days of ICU hospitalization and transferred the next day to the internal medicine unit. An ICU diary was written daily during ICU hospitalization by medical students, as with all intensive care patients hospitalized for severe ARDS on SARS-CoV-2. During the first days post extubation, he presented swallowing disorders and hypophonia. He also presented significant emotionality, anxiety, and sadness associated with false memories with delusional content. Thus, a psychiatric evaluation was requested.  \nDiagnostic assessment  \nWe referred to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to investigate the psychiatric diagnosis. In the beginning of the follow-up by the psychiatry liaison, and according to DSM-5, the symptomatology of the patient continued to partially fill the criteria of delirium, with quick disappearance of the disturbance in consciousness and attention (criterion A), fluctuation of symptoms (criterion B), and disturbance in cognition (criterion C). The patient also developed several symptoms according to DSM-5 criteria, if we consider that the traumatic event was intensive care for ARDS and the intubation reinterpreted like drowning and associated with fear of death (criterion A). We found ten symptoms of criterion B (nine being needed for diagnosis): intrusion symptoms with recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event of his drowning (1); dissociative reactions with flashbacks (2); dissociative amnesia (3); intense and prolonged psychological distress when speaking about the traumatic event (4); negative mood (5); dissociative symptoms with an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic events partially caused by dissociative amnesia and, in other part, by chemical sedation in ICU (6); arousal symptoms with irritable behavior (7); hypervigilance (8); problems with concentration (9); exaggerated startle response (10) (criterion B). The duration of the disturbance (symptoms in criterion B) was 21 days, extending from 3 days and 1 month after trauma exposure (criterion C). The disturbance caused clinically significant distress in this patient (criterion D), and the disturbance was not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (criterion E): although the patient had received many types of drugs with risks of psychotropic adverse effects (sedative agents, antibiotics, and corticoids during the treatment of the ARDS), it could not be explained by these as it continued after they were stopped. Given the history of the depressive episode and the affective lability reported, our differential diagnosis also included an eventual manic episode with mixed features (emotionality, emotional lability, excessive guilt, digressive speech, grandiose ideas). Nevertheless, he did not present other basic maniac symptoms (that is psychomotor acceleration, insomnia, and irritability). Thus, the aforementioned diagnostic was ruled out. In the context of a systematic screening test among patients hospitalized in the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG) due to SARS-CoV-2, patients were systematically evaluated on the following scales during the sanitary crisis to promote early management of psychological manifestations related to COVID-19 and a preventive approach: Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire to assess peritraumatic dissociation (PDEQ), PTSD Check List to assess PTSD (PCL-5), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which helps to discriminate psychic from physical symptoms in patients who suffer from physical symptoms. The patient\u2019s scores at four days post-intubation were 39 for PDEQ (cutoff > 15), 14 for PCL-5 (cutoff > 32), 5 for HADS-Anxiety (cutoff > 11), and 0 for HADS-Depression (cutoff > 11). The peritraumatic dissociation assessed by the high score on the PDEQ scale indicated an important risk of PTSD.  \nTherapeutic interventions  \nLittle information and few guidelines are currently available in medical literature for the prevention of PTSD in ICU survivors in the context of COVID-19. Given the high risk detected by a history of depressive episode, peritraumatic dissociation as assessed by the high PDEQ score, long duration of intubation and sedation (13 days of intubation and 12 days of sedation for this patient), and false memories and amnesia of his intensive care, we looked for strategies to prevent progression. We proceeded to the following therapeutic interventions: intensive psychiatric follow-up (three times per week), use of the ICU diary written by the intensive care team, and low-dose antipsychotic treatment with quetiapine 50 mg twice daily with an anxiolytic goal. The aim of our psychotherapeutic approach, which was successful, was to allow him to increase his feeling of security and to cope with the reality of his traumatic experience to reconstruct a coherent and appropriate account of what he experienced when he was in the ICU.",

She does not smoke or drink alcohol and exercises every week. She successfully completed secondary level education and enjoys her work as an accountant and businesswoman. She lives in a small village, works indoors, and is not exposed to toxic chemicals or radiation. She was taking levothyroxine 25 mcg daily for an underactive thyroid and previously had a mole removed but otherwise no surgical or medical problems. She did not previously use hormonal contraception. She is the eldest of three sisters; one had a previous miscarriage and no live births.  \nClinical findings  \nHer height was 165 cm and weight 97 kg, giving a BMI of 35.6 kg/m\u00b2. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.  \nTimeline  \nShe was married at age 20 years, and after 4 months, in November 2002, she had her first pregnancy without fertility treatment. She spontaneously miscarried at 6 weeks gestation. She conceived again over 1 year later and had a second miscarriage at 5 weeks gestation in February 2004. She was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in 2004 and subsequently had two cycles of ovulation induction with clomiphene followed by five cycles of follicle stimulation with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) injections without conceiving.  \nShe had two stimulated cycles of IVF in 2008 and 2009, resulting in fresh embryo transfer of two embryos each time, without success. She subsequently had three stimulated ICSI cycles until December 2012 with three additional fresh and three frozen transfers, resulting in one pregnancy that ended with miscarriage at 12 weeks gestation. In total she had five stimulated cycles with embryo transfer on eight occasions, five fresh and three frozen transfers. She stopped treatment in 2013 and resumed in 2018 (Fig. 1; ).  \nFig. 1  \nHistory timeline  \nFull size image  \n  \nIn vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection summary  \nFull size table  \nBlood test results in March 2018, prior to attending our practice, showed anovulatory day 21 progesterone 0.49 nmol/l; day 3 blood tests were LH 7.79, FSH 6.19, TSH 3.7iu. Ultrasound revealed PCO morphology, and saline infusion sonography showed bilateral patent fallopian tubes and a normal uterus.  \nDiagnostic assessment  \nWe repeated day 3 blood tests, with the results shown in . A baseline ultrasound in her local hospital showed a normal uterus and bilateral polycystic ovaries. We confirmed polycystic ovarian syndrome based on the ultrasound, elevated DHEA-S, reversed LH to FSH ratio, and higher AMH results.  \n Initial blood results  \nFull size table  \nShe had 7 days of moderately severe premenstrual symptoms with irritability, breast tenderness, and bloating for 7 days before menses with relief at menstruation. She also had persistent fatigue consistent with low endorphins, which we usually treat with low-dose naltrexone.  \nThe patient recorded her fertility cycle and had consecutive menstrual bleeding 45 and 53 days after the first bleeding, respectively, without identifying an ovulation event. Tracking ovulation and the fertility cycle is essential to our treatment plan. Usually, we work with the NeoFertility method through our app at www.chartneo.com. In this case she began recording her cycle with the Creighton model FertilityCare System. See the data summary and Fig. 2.  \nFig. 2  \nAnovulatory fertility chart, Creighton Model FertilityCare System  \nFull size image  \nTherapeutic interventions  \nWe commenced treatment as follows:  \n1. Follicle stimulation with letrozole 17.5 mg daily \u00d7 3 days from day 3 of the cycle  \n2. HCG 10,000 iu trigger mid cycle with 20 mm mature follicle  \n3. Progesterone pessaries (Cyclogest) 400 mg nightly for 10 nights from day 3 after ovulation  \n4. Prednisolone 5 mg every morning  \n5. Naltrexone 4.5 mg nightly  \n6. Supplements with vitamin D3 4000 iu, omega 3 1000 mg, and folic acid 0.4 mg  \n7. Dietary strategy of low carbohydrate intake with minimal dairy and wheat  \n8. Metformin 500 mg twice daily with food  \nWe opted for a higher dose of follicle stimulation in view of the patient\u2019s longer cycles, elevated BMI, previous anovulatory day 21 progesterone levels, and no identifiable peak day from her fertility chart. For most women, we would start with letrozole 12.5\u201317.5 mg for just 1 day, to minimize the risk of multiple pregnancy.  \nShe had a confirmed mature 21 mm follicle , which was proven to rupture by ultrasound follicle tracking . She recruited two more follicles 14\u201315 mm size that did not mature or rupture.  \nFig. 3  \nOne mature follicle, with additional smaller supporting follicles  \nFull size image  \nFig. 4  \nFollicle rupture  \nFull size image  \nWe reduced letrozole to 12.5 mg daily \u00d7 3 days from day 3 on the second cycle of treatment, because we aimed to produce only one mature follicle each cycle.  \nEach day she recorded her fertility pattern with the Creighton FertilityCare system, and once a month she had a blood test for progesterone and estradiol on day 7 after ovulation, as indicated from her fertility chart.  \nFollow-up outcomes  \nWe achieved an optimal cycle with a normal-appearing fertility charting pattern, proven follicle rupture by ultrasound, and optimal levels of progesterone and estradiol on day 7 after ovulation. In addition, her fatigue and PMS symptoms improved.  \nWe encouraged relaxed enjoyable intercourse on alternate days during the fertile time, indicated by clear slippery cervical mucus discharge.  \nThey conceived on the second cycle of ovulation induction. See the data summary and Fig. 5.  \nFig. 5  \nTreated cycles. Fertility observations are recorded in blue ink, while medications are recorded in red ink  \nFull size image  \nUnfortunately, this pregnancy ended in miscarriage at 7 weeks 4 days when the embryonic heart stopped beating. This was managed medically with misoprostol without evacuation of retained products of conception.  \nSince the patient now had over three miscarriages, additional evaluation was performed over the next few months. Parental chromosome analysis found the female had a balanced translocation. It was estimated that her risk of future miscarriage was 25\u201330% each pregnancy. The patient opted for repeat treatment, knowing this risk.  \nShe was advised to have a laparoscopy and hysteroscopy before conceiving again. Surgery was delayed due to hospital restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  \nIn June 2020, she had a hysteroscopy and was found to have a uterine septum, which was resected. This was not seen on previous ultrasound scans. A laparoscopy at the same time showed no endometriosis, bilateral patent tubes, and PCO appearance to the ovaries. She had ovarian drilling of both ovaries.  \nAt the time of surgical admission her pulse was 74/minute and blood pressure 120/80. Her BMI was 34.6 kg/m\u00b2. Physical examination was normal. She was oriented in time, place, and situation. No focal deficits were noted. Urinalysis was clear, and blood tests for FBC, liver function, and urea and electrolytes were all normal.  \nWe resumed medical treatment in July 2020. We discontinued metformin as she had bowel upset and tried myoinositol instead, while asking her to maintain low carbohydrate intake.  \nWe adjusted treatment to:  \n1. Follicle stimulation with letrozole 12.5 mg daily \u00d7 3 days from day 3 of the cycle  \n2. HCG 10,000 iu trigger mid cycle with 20 mm mature follicle  \n3.

The patient was well oriented (GSC 15) with vital signs of blood pressure 100/70, respiratory rate 20, temperature 36.7 \u00b0C, and O2 saturation of 96%. On examination, the distal pulse of his left limb could not be detected and was cold, with a hematoma at the injury site. Color Doppler sonography of lower limbs demonstrated weak arterial flow in distal arteries. Abdominal fast sonography was unremarkable. The injury to the right buttocks was not significant, causing only mild bruising and hematoma .\n\nFig. 1\nShotgun injury to the buttock, demonstrating bruising and hematoma along with the point of entry\nFull size image\n\nHe received pethidine for his pain along with 1 g cephazolin for infection prophylaxis, and also was hydrated with 2 L normal saline due to low blood pressure. Initial laboratory evaluation demonstrated low hemoglobin levels (10 g/dl), for which he received two bags of packed cells, with a platelet count of 107,000. Coagulation tests were normal.\n\nThe patient was scheduled for operation, in which a longitudinal incision was made in the left groin, and the left common femoral artery and vein were explored. On evaluation of the entry point, on the left side, the bullets cut off the origin of the deep femoral origin and the femoral vein, in which avulsion of the proximal end of the left deep femoral artery and partial tearing of the proximal left superficial femoral artery (SFA) (intimal injury) were detected . The deep femoral artery was ligated with a silk 2-0, and the right thigh great saphenous vein was harvested and dilated. After infusion of systemic heparin, the injured part of the SFA was excised, and the proximal and distal parts of the SFA and the popliteal artery were catheterized with Fogarty 4F, followed by thrombectomy, in which the pellet was removed with the Fogarty. It was observed that the bullet had subsequently entered the SFA and traveled to the trifurcation of popliteal deep peroneal. Digital angiography of the left lower extremity was performed, demonstrating the trifurcation of posterior tibialis, anterior tibialis, and peroneal artery to be patent . There were no signs of external injury in the popliteal area. Subsequently, interposition graft with the great saphenous vein was done with proximal and distal anastomoses, with Prolene 5-0 in a continuous manner. The flow was restarted in the limb, hemostasis was obtained, and a hemovac drain was inserted. The wound was repaired in layers with Vicryl 2-0 and Nylon 2-0, along with applying a dressing and a long leg slab .\n\nFig. 2\nThe deep femoral artery and posterior superficial femoral artery injury due to bullet\nFull size image\n\nFig. 3\nSuperficial femoral artery and trifurcation of the popliteal artery after Fogarty, demonstrating no bullet pellets at the lower extremities\nFull size image\n\nFig. 4\nSuperficial femoral artery with saphenous graft anastomosis\nFull size image\n\nFig. 5\nRadiological evaluation of the patient.

Physical examination revealed a 20-mm movable hard mass within the inferolateral quadrant of the right breast with no findings on the overlying skin. Mammography revealed a spiculated mass with segmental and linear calcifications in the mediolateral portion of the right breast (Fig. 1 a, b). Ultrasonography revealed a rough-bordered mass showing internal hypoechogenicity and measuring 16 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 mm\u00b3 in size, in the inferolateral quadrant of the right breast . Magnetic resonance imaging showed a round mass, measuring 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 11 mm\u00b3 in size with rim enhancement . Fine needle aspiration cytology of an axillary lymph node measuring 12 mm in diameter revealed the presence of malignant cells . PET/CT also showed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in the right breast primary [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 11.5] and right axillary lymph node (SUVmax 2.1). Multiple lymph nodes in the right supraclavicular fossa, mediastinum, and around the bilateral hilar, dorsal pancreatic head, abdominal aorta, right common iliac region, and bilateral external iliac region appeared swollen and positive for FDG accumulation (SUVmax 17.0), suggesting distant lymph node metastases (Fig. 1 e, f). Differential diagnoses for multiple lymphadenopathy were required because of the large dissociation between the primary breast cancer and locoregional and distant metastases. Lymph node involvement by malignant tumor, especially malignant lymphoma, and granulomatous disease could be enumerated as differential diagnoses. Suitable lymph nodes that appeared swollen and positive for FDG accumulation near the body surface could not be found for biopsy. For histological diagnosis of multiple lymphadenopathy, EBUS-TBNA of mediastinal lymph nodes was performed (Fig. 3 a, b). Histological findings revealed noncaseous epithelioid granulomas and multinucleated giant cells in mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 3 c, d). Tuberculosis had not been suspected strongly because CT scan did not reveal any exudative lesion in the lung field. Caseous granulomas were not found in all areas on the biopsy sample; therefore, acid-fast bacillus staining was omitted. This patient had been diagnosed with uveitis of unknown cause 5 years before. Systemic disease had been suspected, and necessary screening examining unknown details had been performed. The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme was 9.9 U/mL in the range of 7\u201325 U/mL, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was increased to 627 U/mL (reference range 122\u2013496 U/mL) just before this EBUS-TBNA. Based on a history of uveitis, the elevated concentration of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and the histological findings, we reached a diagnosis.

The physical sequelae of this injury included partial damage to the right frontoparietal lobe and left frontal lobe, right enophthalmos, left hemiplegia, and loss of vision in the right eye . He developed unconsciousness following generalized seizures at the age of 10 years and was diagnosed with secondarily generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures. His seizures were not stopped by levetiracetam, sodium valproate, lamotrigine, clobazam, zonisamide, perampanel, phenobarbital, clonazepam, or lacosamide treatment. The frequency of seizures was recorded monthly. At 13 years of age, when carbamazepine was administered, brief muscle contractions of the upper limb occurred, and these seizures continued after carbamazepine was discontinued. Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) showed high-amplitude spikes or spikes and waves located in the left frontal pole to the frontal region . On video EEG monitoring, the ictal EEG revealed generalized rhythmic spike bursts preceded by a spike wave in the left hemisphere, followed by slow-wave bursts with left hemisphere dominance corresponding to his habitual seizures, which were characterized by turning his head to the left and left upper limb flexion along with muscle contraction in a sitting position after a fall backward and unawareness lasting 5 seconds . In addition to the aforementioned drugs, oral administration of rufinamide and clorazepate did not reduce seizure frequency. After obtaining informed consent, ACTH therapy (synthetic ACTH, a zinc hydroxide suspension of tetracosactide acetate; Cortrosyn-Z [Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan]) was initiated at 10 months after video EEG monitoring. ACTH was administered as daily intramuscular injections (0.0125 mg/kg) for 2 weeks and was then gradually tapered off over 1 week. On day 10 of ACTH therapy, although his habitual seizures before ACTH therapy disappeared transiently, he developed new seizures characterized by left arm contractions followed by movements of touching things with his right hand and writhing and rocking his body left and right and back and forth as automatisms. On video EEG monitoring, the ictal EEG of the newly developing seizures showed generalized low-voltage fast waves followed by high voltage in the left hemisphere only, which was then followed by high-voltage slow-wave bursts with left hemisphere dominance . The seizures clustered for 40 minutes and disappeared after suppository administration of 10 mg diazepam. Interictal EEG at 4 days after the development of the new seizures showed spikes located in the left frontal region . These seizures did not reoccur after more than 2 years of follow-up.

The patient had no history of any comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure. He had started to walk independently and without support 8 months after injury. He had received several other treatments, including physiotherapy, exercise therapy, medication, and botulinum toxin injections to relieve spasticity of the upper limb, but still complained of spasticity and dysfunction in the left upper limb. We aimed to evaluate the immediate effect of a single session of DN on this patient with left hemiplegia after TBI, who suffered from spasticity of the upper limb. The study was approved by the research ethics committee of Shiraz School of Rehabilitation Sciences.\n\nAssessment\nOutcome measures were evaluated before and 1 hour after the DN intervention.\na) The upper limb recovery stage and hand function\nThe upper limb recovery stage and hand function were determined using a criterion defined by Brunnstrom (), which has been introduced as a valid test for the assessment of patients with post-stroke hemiplegia.\n\nb) Spasticity\nSpasticity was assessed by the Persian Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS) in the elbow, wrist, and finger flexors, forearm pronator, and thenar muscles. The MMAS grades the intensity of muscle spasticity on a 0\u20134 scale (). The patient was supine and the head was midline to prevent an asymmetric tonic reflex that may increase spasticity.\n\nc) Passive resistance force\nPassive resistance force (PRF) was determined biomechanically by a handheld dynamometer (HHD) using the clinical method to assess spasticity with MMAS. The amount of Newtonian force (N) applied to the dynamometer sensitive pad by the evaluator against spasticity of the elbow, wrist, and finger flexors, forearm pronator, and thenar muscles to move them from flexion to extension and from pronation to supination at the end of the existing range of motion (ROM) and by gravity was measured. HHD is a reliable and valid tool for muscle evaluation in clinical settings.\n\nd) Range of motion\nA standard goniometer was used to measure the active ROM (AROM) and passive ROM (PROM).\nElbow extension\nThe patient was supine with the hand supinated. The axis of the goniometer was placed at the lateral epicondyle of the elbow, the stationary arm was parallel with the humerus, and the movement arm was parallel with the radius. Then, the assessor extended the patient\u2019s elbow passively and recorded the end position of elbow extension as PROM. The same procedure was followed for the measurement of elbow extension AROM unless the patient was asked to extend voluntarily the elbow.\n\nWrist extension\nThe patient was in a sitting position next to the table, elbow flexed to 90\u00b0, and forearm in mid-position rested on the supporting surface. The axis of the goniometer was placed at the snuff box, the stationary arm was along the lateral radius, and the movement arm was aligned with the second metacarpal. Then, the assessor extended the patient\u2019s wrist passively and recorded the end position of wrist extension as PROM. The same procedure was followed for the measurement of wrist extension AROM unless the patients were asked to extend voluntarily the wrist.\n\nForearm supination\nThe patient was seated with the shoulder adducted by their side, elbow flexed to 90\u00b0, and forearm in the neutral position to start. The axis of the goniometer was placed over the tip of the third digit. The stationary arm was parallel with the humerus, and the movement arm was aligned with the volar forearm surface. The assessor supinated the patient\u2019s forearm passively and recorded the end position forearm supination as PROM. The same procedure was followed for the measurement of forearm supination AROM unless the patients were asked to supinate voluntarily the forearm.\n\nCarpometacarpal (thumb) extension\nThe patient was in a sitting position next to the table, elbow flexed to 90\u00b0, and forearm in mid-position rested on the supporting surface. The axis of the goniometer was placed at the palmar aspect of the first carpometacarpal (CMC) joint, the stationary arm was along the ventral midline of the radius using the ventral surface of radial head and styloid for reference, and the movement arm was along the ventral midline of the first metacarpal. The assessor extended the patient\u2019s thumb passively and recorded the end position of the thumb extension as PROM. The same procedure was followed for the measurement of thumb extension AROM unless the patients were asked to extend voluntarily the thumb.\n\nCarpometacarpal (thumb) abduction\nThe patient was in sitting position next to the table, elbow flexed to 90\u00b0, and forearm in mid-position rested on the supporting surface. The axis of the goniometer was placed at the lateral aspect of the radial styloid process. The stationary arm was along the lateral midline of the second metacarpal. Reference center of the second MCP joint, and the movement arm was lateral midline of the first metacarpal. Reference center of first MCP joint. The assessor abducted the patient\u2019s thumb passively and recorded the end position of thumb abduction as PROM. The same procedure was followed for the measurement of thumb abduction AROM unless the patients were asked to abduct voluntarily the thumb.\n\nBox and Block Test\nReliable and valid Box and Block Test (BBT) was used to measure hand dexterity. A test box, divided by a partition into two compartments of equal size consisting of 150 blocks, was placed in front of the patient on a standard-height table. The patient, sitting in a chair with a standard height, was instructed to remove the blocks one by one with the healthy hand and then with the injured hand, moving them from one compartment to another. The patient was encouraged to perform the test as quickly as possible. The number of blocks transferred to another test box chamber within 1 minute was recorded as BBT score.\n\nDN intervention\nThe patient received a DN session using disposable stainless steel needles (0.25 mm \u00d7 50 mm), which were inserted into the muscle through the skin. Treatment steps included hand washing, wearing disposable examination gloves, and cleansing the skin. The patient\u2019s skin was prepared with an alcohol swab before intervention. Muscle positioning for DN was performed according to Dommerholt Second Edition. The patient was lying down, arm away from the trunk, and forearm in the middle position. The target muscles received a DN using the fast-in and fast-out technique described by Hong. Visual or tactile identification of the local twitch response (LTR) was considered a clinical sign of DN function because the patient\u2019s main complaint was spasticity. Muscles treated were the elbow flexors (biceps brachii and brachialis), the wrist flexors (flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, flexors digitorum superficialis, and profundus), and the thenar muscles (opponens pollicis, adductor pollicis).\n\nBiceps brachii\nThe patient lay down supine with the arm slightly flexed. The muscle was grasped between the thumb and index and long fingers. Taut bands were identified. The muscle was needled from a lateral approach.\n\nBrachialis\nThe patient lay down supine with the elbow relaxed and slightly flexed. The muscle was needled via flat palpation in the lateral aspect of the arm, distal two-thirds of the humerus. The needle was directed medially between the biceps and triceps brachii.\n\nFlexors digitorum superficialis and profundus\nThe patient lay down in supine position with the forearm almost supinated. The muscles were needled with flat palpation; the needle was inserted perpendicular to the skin and directed toward the interosseous membrane.\n\nFlexor carpi radialis (FCR)\nThe patient lay down in supine position with the forearm almost supinated. A point at the medial forearm, 4 cm below the point 1 cm medial to the midpoint of elbow crease, was needled for FCR.\n\nFlexor carpi ulnaris (FCU)\nThe patient lay down in supine position with the forearm almost supinated. A point at the midpoint of the proximal third segment of a line from the medial epicondyle to the ulnar styloid process was needled for FCU.\n\nPronator teres (PT)\nPronator teres was needled at the proximal and medial forearm, 1 cm below the midpoint of elbow crease between the medial epicondyle and biceps brachii tendon.\n\nThenar muscles (opponens pollicis)\nThe needle was inserted at a point on the dorsum of the hand at the site of the proximal angle formed between the first and second metacarpal bones.\n\nThenar muscles (adductor pollicis)\nThe needle was inserted via the radial aspect of the first metacarpal (to avoid palmar fascia) toward the thenar eminence.",

The lesion had no micro- or macrocalcification in the examination. There was no evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy in the US investigation . Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion was done, and the microscopic examination of prepared slides showed many, varied size lymphoid cells containing some atypical large lymphoid cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio and prominent nucleoli. The cytopathology of the specimen diagnosed tissue suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorder, and excisional biopsy of the mass was recommended. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion through total thyroidectomy, and the postoperative pathology examination revealed thymic tissue. Six months after surgery, the patient was referred for reevaluation; all physical examination and laboratory tests were rechecked and found to be normal. Fig. 1 Ultrasonography evaluation of the suspected lesion Full size image On microscopic assessment of the excised lesion, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections showed an encapsulated mass with thick fibrous capsule and intersecting fibrous bands separating it into lobulated architecture with cellular lobules resembling normal thymic cortex, which were composed of scattered bland thymic epithelial cells in a dense background of small lymphocytes (immature T cells). On immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluation, the scattered epithelial tumoral cells showed immunoreactivity for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (CK AE1/AE3) and P63. Background lymphoid cells showed diffuse immunoreactivity for leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD3, CD43, and CD99; however, they were negative for CD20. The Ki-67 proliferation index was very high in lymphoid cells .

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion was done, and the microscopic examination of prepared slides showed many, varied size lymphoid cells containing some atypical large lymphoid cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio and prominent nucleoli. The cytopathology of the specimen diagnosed tissue suspicious for lymphoproliferative disorder, and excisional biopsy of the mass was recommended. The patient underwent surgical excision of the lesion through total thyroidectomy, and the postoperative pathology examination revealed thymic tissue. Six months after surgery, the patient was referred for reevaluation; all physical examination and laboratory tests were rechecked and found to be normal. However, an unexpected finding on follow-up imaging revealed what appeared to be a localized abscess within the thymus, raising concerns for a possible abscess of thymus. Further investigation and imaging studies were recommended to confirm the nature of this unexpected finding.",

    "original_case": "We report the case of a Caucasian girl with a family history of an older brother and twin sister having the same syndrome. The patient was born as twin A (birth weight 1800 g, length 45 cm) and showed dysmorphic features from birth including a large fontanel, low-hanging ears, and a bulbous nose (cf. Fig. 2C in Ref. [1]). Clinodactyly, for example, short fifth fingers with only one flexion joint and palms with singular crease, was likewise noted. At birth, the head circumference was below average and like twin B. At 20 months, her general practitioner discovered an acceleration in head circumference growth to two SD above average, compared with her twin sister (average for age). It was further noted that the girl was not able to walk independently yet, but apart from this there were no signs of neurological compromise, pain, or growth retardation. MRI of the brain showed enlarged lateral ventricles with a prominent choroid plexus . At first, aqueduct stenosis was suspected, but this was later disproved by ventriculoscopy and ventriculography. Therefore, the patient was treated with a VP shunt at 2 years of age. On the second postoperative day, she showed signs of massive CSF accumulation into the abdominal cavity and fluid leakage through the abdominal cicatrices. Revision of the shunt showed no leakage and confirmed a functioning shunt system. The clinicians concluded that the CSF formation greatly exceeded the ability of the patient\u2019s abdominal absorptive capability. Subsequently, the VP shunt was replaced with a VA shunt during the same admission. Fig. 1 T1-weighted axial (a) and coronal (b) MRI images obtained at patient age 2 years, showing hydrocephalus due to enlarged lateral ventricles (LV) encompassing a prominent choroid plexus (*). Full size image At 6 years of age, the girl was now attending special classes due to slight psychomotor compromise, but she had language and independent ambulatory function. However, due to irregular episodes of headache and vomiting, hydrocephalus was suspected, resulting in an X-ray image showing displacement of the atrial part of the drain due to growth. Surgically prolongation of the drain was successfully performed, relieving the pressure symptoms. At 14 years of age, irregular episodes of headache and vomiting reappeared. Shunt dysfunction was suspected, and cerebral MRI showed a large occipital cyst in contact with the right lateral ventricle. Operative fenestration was performed, successfully relieving the symptoms. At 16 years of age, the patient was diagnosed with a condition based on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showing dilation of the left ventricle and diminished ejection fraction (EF, 49%). The TTE was performed because her twin sister had been diagnosed with a similar condition several years before. Subsequent pharmacological treatment was started. Some months later, the patient was admitted to the neurosurgical ward showing signs of shunt dysfunction (that is, headache, vomiting, and tiredness). The neurological examination did not reveal any specific compromise, but subsequent ophthalmological examination (fundus photography) revealed papilledema, supporting the clinical suspicion of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). MRI of the brain was performed and showed a colloid cyst in the third ventricle, possibly occluding the foramen of Monro . Fig. 2 T1-weighted axial MRI obtained at age 16 years, showing occlusion of the foramen of Monro by a colloid cyst (arrow) and a cystic enlargement of the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. * = lateral ventricle Full size image Cystic drainage through endoscopic puncture only helped temporarily. Revision of the shunt system showed occlusion of the ventricular drain, and replacement was likewise only temporary alleviating as the symptoms of headache, vomiting, and tiredness reappeared within 24 hours. Accordingly, the ICP was monitored by placement of an intracranial ICP monitor and found to be significantly increased at around 30 mmHg, prompting externalization of the drain and measurements of CSF production. Externalization of the drain relieved all clinical symptoms, but measurements revealed high CSF production of 60\u2013100 ml liquor per hour. Endoscopic visualization showed that the choroid plexus was enlarged, hypertrophic, and well vascularized. Choroid plexus coagulation was performed bilaterally in the lateral and temporal horn of the ventricles, leading to an immediate decrease of daily CSF formation to 20\u201330 ml liquor per hour. Pharmaceutical treatment diminished daily CSF production to approximately 300 ml. Subsequently a VP shunt (DeltaSnap 1.0) was placed, and the remaining admission was uneventful. Follow-up after 1 and 2 months displayed no signs of hydrocephalus or ascites. No complications or neurological deficits were found. At a regular follow-up 10 months later, it was noted that the girl thrived and was more active and less tired in school and at home.",

At 20 months of age, her general practitioner noticed a sudden increase in head circumference growth compared to her twin sister. Further evaluation revealed enlarged lateral ventricles and a prominent choroid plexus on brain MRI. Initially suspected aqueduct stenosis was ruled out, and the patient underwent VP shunt placement due to excessive CSF accumulation. Postoperatively, she experienced complications with CSF leakage and underwent shunt revision. Over time, she presented with recurring symptoms of headache and vomiting, leading to interventions such as drain prolongation and shunt fenestration. At 16 years old, she was diagnosed with left ventricular dilation and reduced ejection fraction, prompting pharmacological treatment. Subsequent episodes of shunt dysfunction were managed with externalization of the drain and choroid plexus coagulation, resulting in decreased CSF production.

At the first visit, height and weight of the patient were 165 cm and 74 kg, respectively. Blood pressure was 117/84 mmHg, heart rate was 95 beats/minute, and body temperature was 38.3 \u00b0C. The patient had no history of smoking or drinking. On physical examination, he had a lower-extremity developmental and neurological defect that prevented him from walking. He had used ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day before presenting to us. The patient first had routine biochemical blood and urine analyses, including WBC, CRP, creatinine, urine analysis, and urine culture/antibiogram, and urinary USG and non-contrast full abdominal tomography were requested for imaging. CRP and WBC values were high (320 g/L, 17 \u00d7 10^3, respectively). Urine analysis revealed microscopic hematuria with red blood cells (RBC) 10\u201315/high-power field (hpf) and microscopic leukocyturia with white blood cells (WBC) 20\u201325/hpf. Blood creatinine, liver functions, and other biochemical tests showed no problem. Urinary system ultrasonography and noncontrast full abdominal tomography identified a 15 \u00d7 8 mm stone in the left upper ureter and linked grade 2 hydronephrosis. Firstly, we wished to insert a DJ stent under general anesthesia with the aim of providing urinary drainage for the left kidney. However, the guide wire could not progress past the lower ureter (probably due to tortuosity), so the patient was turned to prone position in the same session, and the posterior lower calyx of the kidney was entered with 18G needle through this narrow interval accompanied by ultrasound and a 14F percutaneous nephrostomy catheter was inserted . A sample of material coming from the nephrostomy was sent for culture-antibiogram tests. From these, Escherichia coli proliferated. As a result of the culture antibiogram, the multidrug-resistant bacterial agent was sensitive to the carbapenem group, and 1 g meropenem treatment 3 times a day was given in the hospital for a total of 10 days. After appropriate antibiotic treatment, nephrostomy and bladder urine were identified to be free of biological agents. Then, after receiving patient consent, RIRS was planned with a flexible ureterorenoscope. The patient was administered general anesthesia and then placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The bladder was reached with a 7.5 rigid ureterorenoscope, and a guide wire was sent into the right ureter. The lower tip of the ureter was dilated with the rigid ureterorenoscope. As the access sheath could not progress above the guide wire, the kidney was reached directly with the flexible ureterorenoscope. The stone was at the upper tip of the ureter and was fragmented with Ho:YAG laser (1 J power, 10 Hz frequency). At the end of the procedure, a DJ stent was inserted.

The patient also had recurring hemoptysis, which started 2 years before and worsened in the past 6 months. Previously, she received antituberculosis treatment for 6 months, along with inhaled long-acting bronchodilator and steroid therapies. However, no clinical improvement was observed. Upon physical examination, severe dyspnea with stridor and decreasing vesicular breath sounds in the left lung were found. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) performed 1 week earlier revealed a mass on the left main bronchus (Fig. 1 A, E) and segmental atelectasis of the left lung , with infiltrates in segments 1, 2, and 3 of the left lung, along with consolidation in the left inferior lobe and narrowing of the main left bronchus.

F Coronal mediastinal window of the chest CT scan taken 2 months after radiotherapy and chemotherapy, showing no pulmonary mass. Full size image The multidisciplinary medical team decided that the case was inoperable due to the large tumors, severe central airway obstruction, and large lung involvement; thus, therapeutic bronchoscopy was the best feasible treatment plan for the patient. After discussing with the patient and her family, 3 days after the patient\u2019s admission, the medical team decided to perform bronchoscopic examination and tracheobronchial mass removal through rigid bronchoscopy. Lobulated masses obstructing almost the entire distal tracheal lumen up to the carina and the entire left main bronchus lumen were found on bronchoscopy . A neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser was used first to facilitate mass shrinkage. After the laser treatment, mechanical debulking using a rigid scope was performed. Intraprocedure bleeding was managed with argon plasma coagulation (APC) through posttherapeutic bronchoscopy. The tracheal and carinal lumens were opened to > 50% of their diameter, with the left main bronchus lumen opened only slightly . After bronchoscopic mass removal, the patient was stable, and no stridor was found. The dyspnea was relieved with 96\u201398% peripheral oxygen saturation in room air.

C Bronchoscopic view 2 months after radiotherapy and chemotherapy, showing no endoluminal mass and only slight malacia. Full size image Pathological examination using hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining confirmed the presence of a tumor mass with solid islets and a cribriform structure. The tumor cells had relatively uniform and basaloid nuclei. Mitosis was rarely found. The bronchial mucosa was visible above the surface of the tumor, and no perineural invasion was found (Fig. 3 A, B). Molecular or cancer-related genetic testing and immunohistochemical staining to confirm the diagnosis were not performed because of insurance limitations.

Full size image Definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) targeting the tracheobronchial mass, including the distal trachea, carina, and left main bronchus as gross tumor volume (GTV), was commenced 2 weeks after the therapeutic bronchoscopy. The clinical target volume (CTV) was GTV + 1 cm, and the planning target volume was CTV + 0.5 cm. The total dose plan amounted to 60\u2009Gy, but the radiation dose could be delivered at 40 Gy and administered in 20 fractions of 2\u2009Gy. After 20 fractions of radiation over 4 weeks, the patient developed esophagitis and dysphagia. Positioning the patient with thermoplastic masks was difficult because of mucous hypersecretion and persistent coughing. Two weeks after the radiotherapy series, the patient received a chemotherapy regimen consisting of carboplatin with an area under the curve of 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, given three times weekly for a total of six cycles. The patient tolerated the treatment well and did not experience any toxicities. Two months after completion of the treatment, the patient had no dyspnea. In reevaluation by chest CT scan, no mass in either lung or the mediastinum and no lymph node enlargement were visible . The trachea and main bronchi were normal (Fig. 1 B, F). Bronchoscopy also revealed no mass and only slight malacia . Finally, the patient was planned to undergo routine evaluation by thoracic CT scan every 3\u20136 months.

The etiology for corneal opacity was not investigated, but he was a candidate for corneal grafting. Ophthalmic examination in our center revealed bilateral severe corneal xerosis, total stromal haziness, normal intraocular pressure, and normal fundoscopy. Treatment with intravenous fluid, IV antibiotic (ceftriaxone), and antipyretic (paracetamol) was started. Since the patient had a prolonged expiration time with hyperaeration on chest X-ray, albuterol (MDI) was started with two puffs every 4 hours via spacer, to which he responded well. Initial laboratory tests on admission were as following: complete blood count (CBC); WBC 16,400/\u00b5l, 27% lymphocytes and 52% neutrophils, hemoglobin: 10 mg/dL, platelet count: 324,000/\u03bcL. C-reactive protein (CRP) 50 mg/l, urea 16 mg/dl (16.6\u201340), creatinine 0.6 mg/dl (0.2\u20130.8), and urine analysis was normal, Microscopic evaluation of the patient\u2019s stool showed moderate fatty acid droplets. Culture samples taken from blood and sputum were negative. Chest CT scan revealed bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with mild bronchial wall thickening and peribronchial cuffing (Figure 1).",

She did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. She had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia and is currently taking enalapril and atorvastatin. She has no remarkable family history. In her country of origin, she had undergone conization of the cervix to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III with positive margins in 2011. She did not attend any follow-up appointments. In 2014, she presented for clinical evaluation and had a normal cytology result, but tested positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV); colposcopic examination showed no apparent lesions. The patient visited our clinic for the first time in 2015 and underwent cervical and vaginal cytology. She was asymptomatic at the time. The sample was satisfactory for analysis and tested negative for atypical cells and positive for HR-HPV 16. Co-testing was scheduled for a year later, but the patient did not attend the appointment and was lost to follow-up. She returned in 2020, presenting with greenish vaginal discharge of 3 months\u2019 duration. The cervix was not visible during speculum examination; a point-like orifice consistent with the cervical canal was observed towards the right of the vaginal fornix. It was not possible to gain access for endometrial sampling, and post-conization cervical stenosis was suspected. Transvaginal ultrasound showed occupation of the entire uterine cavity by dense material consistent with pyometra, in addition to myometrial thinning due to tension and cervical dilation. Cervical and vaginal cytology was negative for atypical cells and positive for HPV 16. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis  confirmed the presence of pyometra (139 mm \u00d7 70 mm \u00d7 61 mm). The staging study was negative. The patient was treated with laparoscopic hysterectomy with double adnexectomy. Examination of the abdominal cavity showed no abnormal findings. The physical and neurological examination on admission was normal. Upon arrival, her vital signs were blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, pulse rate 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and body temperature 36.8 \u00b0C. The results of routine blood tests showed a normal blood cell count; hemoglobin (Hgb) 12.1 g/dl, leukocytes (10 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl), neutrophils: 7 \u00d7 10 9 /L, platelets 250 \u00d7 10 9 /L, negative C-reactive protein (CRP; < 0.5 mg/L). Screening for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serologies were done and found to be negative. Furthermore, liver enzymes, coagulogram, urea and creatinine, and acid\u2013base status of the blood were normal. During admission, intravenous analgesia was prescribed with 1 g of paracetamol every 8 hours. The patient was discharged on clinical day 1 and hemodynamically stable. Oral antiinflammatories were prescribed as needed, and she did not require readmission. Follow-up visits were every 4 months. The patient was symptom free 12 months after surgery.

Superficial spreading SCC in situ was also observed in the lower uterine segment and endometrium (Fig. 1 B, C). There were no signs of lymphovascular invasion or infiltration of the fallopian tubes or ovaries. SCC of the cervix with superficial spread to the endometrium is rare. It is not included in the 2020 (fifth edition) World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Female Genital Tract Tumors or the 2018 FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) cervical cancer staging system.

    "original_case": "A 19-year-old Javanese man was admitted to our spine unit in the Orthopedic and Traumatology Department of Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital. The patient had a history of falling from a motorcycle in a road traffic accident 3 years ago, followed by a decrease in functional movement of both legs with leg pain. There was no finding of radiculopathy, reduction of neck range of movement, or sensory deficit. Six months following this first traumatic incident, the patient fell in the bathroom with supine position. The patient was still able to move his legs. However, he was not able to stand or walk. The patient mobilized by dragging his body using both hands. His family as care-givers took the patient to a traditional massage therapist as the initial management, without seeking any adequate medical treatment at a health center. The patient was put in knee\u2013chest position to decrease the pain, and it turned out that this position had made the patient feel more comfortable. The medicine man and those around the patient considered placing him in reduced movement and stretching stimulation, believing that this method would allow his injuries to heal. The patient was bedridden at best, without any other kind of mobilization and limited daily activities. This condition gradually worsened over the last 1.5 years. A major decrease in body weight accompanied by multiple painful and itchy skin lesions were found to be due to insufficient nutritional support and poor hygiene. The patient was then referred to the regional general hospital and diagnosed with scabies, but no bony and spinal cord abnormalities were found. Faced with a lack of adequate medical treatment and progressive deterioration of his condition with worsening of the skin condition, as well as a decrease in body weight, the patient was eventually taken by a nongovernmental organization to our spine unit. The patient had no remarkable past illness, medication, family, or psychosocial history. Our physical examination showed no anemic conjunctiva, icteric sclerae, and bruises over thoracic region. There was symmetric movement of both sides of the lungs during inspiration and expiration, with vesicular breath sounds and normal heart sounds plus no rales, murmur, or gallop. Abdominal examination was difficult to perform due to his poor nutritional status, skin condition, and flexion contractures in the lower extremities. The local state of the back showed no deformity. However, there were open wounds of multiple grade 3 pressure ulcers on the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral region . Tenderness on palpation was found with pain severity at level 2/3 on a visual analog scale. The patient presented sensory deficit at levels C5\u2013T1 and L2\u2013S1 with marked hypoesthesia below T1 level and associated paraplegic motor deficit over C5\u2013T1 and L2\u2013S1 level on neurological examination. Fig. 1 Patient presented with flexion contractures of bilateral hip, knee, and ankle joints (A and B) with associated condition of multiple pressure ulcers at sacral, lumbar, and bilateral femoral shaft region (C) Full size image The preserved overall magnitude of muscle strength in the patient was 2/2 at C5\u2013T1 level and 0/0 at L2\u2013S1. Range of movement for hip, knee extension, and ankle extension, eversion, dorsiflexion, and plantarflexion were limited due to contracture. Reflexes over patellar tendon and Achilles tendon were difficult to evaluate due to the contractures in the lower extremities. Urinary incontinence without fecal incontinence and no pathological reflexes of Babinsky group nor clonus were discovered on examination. We further investigated the patient by using laboratory and radiography studies. Blood albumin and hemoglobin level were at low level (9.0 g/dL and 1.9 g/dL, respectively). Besides, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts were increased (11,110/\u00b5L and 977,000/\u00b5L, respectively). Culture of skin swab on the base of decubitus ulcers showed Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli as the main bacteria in the wounds. Plain radiography of thorax, pelvis, lumbar vertebrae, bilateral cruris, and bilateral femur showed no fracture or destruction, except for flexion deformity of bilateral genu and ankle, with marked bilateral ankle inversion. All plain radiographs showed porotic and decreased density of the bone (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast  showed hyperextension deformity over cervical vertebral column, kyphotic and scoliotic deformity over thoracal vertebral column, without any increase in contrast intensity related to pathological condition across corpus vertebral and intra medulla. MRI study did not showed any significant compression over the cord or myelomalacia changes. We were highly concerned about and gave attention to this case because of its complexity, requiring comprehensive multidisciplinary management, not only from the orthopedic and traumatology field, but also from other departments in our center, Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital. We involved our internist and clinical nutritionist colleagues for managing the patient\u2019s general condition, especially related to the comorbid condition of pulmonary infection and severe malnutrition. Regarding skin hygiene and wound care in treating the skin lesions and multiple pressure ulcers, we involved our dermatologist and plastic surgeon colleagues. In our orthopedic surgical field, with the help of rehabilitative colleagues, we performed passive stretching and movement 3\u20135 times a day with a total time of 30\u201360 minutes daily for all joints in the upper and lower extremities. Besides, we also performed sustained stretching using continuous traction over lower extremity, consisting of hip, knee, and ankle joints on both sides of the legs . The goal of the treatment in this patient was to gradually re-enable independent daily activities.

The pain started 4 months earlier and radiated to the anterior sciatic region, the right groin, and the posterior region of the right thigh, unceasing during night or resting time. The pain was not exacerbated by coughing or changing posture. It was associated with tingling and redness along the right thigh. Before admission, the patient was administered intramuscular dexamethasone at a dose of 8 mg three times a week for 3 months. This was done to treat the suspected arthritis and its related back pain. The patient had no significant medical history. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right paraspinal muscles, associated with right hip movement limitation, while the proximal right thigh strength could not be evaluated due to excessive pain, and no swelling was found above the inguinal ligament. The rest of the examination was within normal limits. Laboratory tests were normal apart from white blood cell count of 12,000/\u00b5l, neutrophils 89%, hemoglobin 10 g/dl, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCV) 70 fl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 87 mm/h, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 86.7 mg/l (reference range (RR) up to 6 mg/l).

Despite negative bacterial cultures and TB testing, a repeat Xpert-MTB test from a new sample obtained during surgical intervention returned positive, indicating a granulomatous disorder of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. However, the true diagnosis of Granulomatous tuberculosis was confirmed upon further evaluation.\n\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nAssistant: The most likely diagnosis is granulomatous tuberculosis. The patient's history of living in a tuberculosis-endemic region, the presence of a lung nodule, and the positive Xpert-MTB test on a new sample obtained during surgical intervention are all indicators of tuberculosis. Additionally, the patient's response to anti-tuberculosis treatment supports this diagnosis.",

On admission, workup was notable for hemoglobin of 5.7 g/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 28.1 seconds (s), INR 2.7, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) > 180 seconds, D-dimer of 1.02 \u03bcg/mL (normal < 0.5 \u03bcg/mL), and normal fibrinogen. Anticoagulation was held, but she continued to develop bruises daily with persistently elevated PTT > 180 seconds that failed to correct with mixing studies, raising concern for a factor deficiency. Further workup revealed factor VIII activity < 1% (normal 75\u2013220%). Given her prolonged PTT, LA testing was performed and found to be positive. Initial testing for a factor VIII inhibitor using the standard Bethesda assay was confounded by the presence of LA, requiring a specialized chromogenic Bethesda assay, which confirmed the presence of the inhibitor at 61 Bethesda units (normal \u2264 0.5 units). She did not meet diagnostic criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) despite testing positive for LA; additional testing was negative for anticardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein antibodies. Given the association between acquired factor VIII inhibitors and malignancy, additional screening for concomitant malignancy was performed. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was unremarkable. Serum protein electrophoresis suggested an inflammatory picture but was otherwise unremarkable. A bone marrow biopsy performed during a future unrelated hospital admission was also unremarkable. Fig. 1. Extensive ecchymoses. A Ecchymosis of left arm. B Ecchymosis of left flank.

    "original_case": "The presented case is a non-Hispanic Caucasian female who was diagnosed with a condition at age 9 years, following acute onset of severe anxiety that manifested as separation anxiety and school phobia. Tics, and other physical symptoms typically seen in patients, were not present as per her parents. The patient was initially treated with ibuprofen, and then OCS. The patient responded favorably to pulse OCS therapy initially. Secondary to persistently low immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1), the patient was referred to the Pediatric Allergy/Immunology Clinic at age 10 years. Her condition was stable for the next 2 years with prophylaxis antibiosis (azithromycin) only. At age 12 years, following a viral syndrome, a major exacerbation of anxiety occurred and a high dose IVIg (1 gram/kg/dose x2) caused a severe adverse reaction (nausea, vomiting, and severe headache). Supplemental IVIg (0.8 g/kg/dose every 3 weeks) to prevent recurrent respiratory infection was well tolerated, with resolution of her anxiety symptoms. However, at age 15 years, sudden onset of acute abdomen resulted in a visit to the emergency room. Abdominal pain progressively worsened over the next several months. She was eventually diagnosed based on biopsy findings: lesions in the terminal ileum. Her condition was treated with oral budesonide (Entocort EC) for 1 month without improvement. Thus, adalimumab 7.5 mg subcutaneous (SQ) injection every 2 weeks was started, and then switched to 7.5 mg SQ every week, resulting in improvement of her gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with resolution of lesions 8 months after weekly adalimumab 7.5 mg SQ. However, she suffered from severe joint symptoms; she was found to have positive antihistone antibody and thought to have had drug-induced lupus. Therefore, adalimumab was switched to infliximab IV (300 mg/dose) every 8 weeks and then eventually every 4 weeks. Switching to infliximab IV infusion led to onset of severe fatigue/headache and adverse reactions to IVIg (joint ache, headache, skin rash, and malaise). Part of her pain symptoms were attributed to subcutaneous nerve entrapment at that time. Prior to the start of TNF-\u03b1 blockers, she tolerated IVIg without any adverse reactions. During the next 12 months, she continued to have severe fatigue, headache, joint ache, and recurrence of abdominal pain without symptomatic relief by changing Ig infusion from IV to SQ routes. Various regimens of pre- and post-medications for IVIg provided no symptomatic relief. The results of extensive GI workup exploring the organic causes affecting intestine, pancreas, and liver were unrevealing. Because of her puzzling clinical features, we turned to genetic analysis. WES revealed AD variants of NLRP12 [C.1054>T, minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.04%] and IRF2BP2 (c.1180A>C, MAF 0.006%), and heterozygous, autosomal recessive, pathological variant of ATM (c.7089+2T>G). GOF mutations of IRF2BP2 were reported to cause hypogammaglobulinemia, suppressing production of cytokines and B cell differentiation. NLRP12 is reported to have a role in gut immune homeostasis, and the mutation found in this case is reported in two patients with a specific syndrome. These variants are inherited from her father. Interestingly, the paternal grandmother, who was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, did not respond well to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors either, as per her parents. Prior to this genetic workup, the presented case was diagnosed with low Von Willebrand status based on DDVAP challenge in 2017; she has had symptoms of easy bruising and hypermenorrhea. Given the similarity of her neuropsychiatric and joint symptoms to an autoinflammatory syndrome and her lack of responses to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, infliximab was discontinued. Then, 10 weeks after, anakinra, an IL-1\u03b2 blocker, was started (100 mg/day). Supplemental Ig was also discontinued secondary to her severe adverse reactions. She revealed marked improvement of her clinical symptoms (headache, fatigue, joint ache, sleep disturbance, and symptoms resembling postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)) over 2\u20133 months after starting anakinra SQ injection. However, her POTS symptoms were not completely resolved. Five months after starting anakinra, she had recurrence of mild diarrhea that resolved with a 10-day course of metronidazole, although microbial workup was negative. Then, 12 months after discontinuation of infliximab, the GI symptoms due to a specific infection occurred, which led to the recurrence of lesions. Thus, 5 months after onset of the specific infection, treatment with another medication (45 mg SQ injection x2, 4 weeks apart, then every 12 weeks) was initiated, and remission was achieved in 6 months. Anakinra was discontinued after remission was achieved.",

Six weeks earlier he fell 4 m from a ladder, resulting in multiple rib fractures and a left-sided pneumothorax diagnosed on chest radiography. The pneumothorax was treated with a chest drain placed in the left anterior axillary line at the level of the papilla. Pain-relieving medication included paracetamol, ibuprofen, and oxycodone, and the patient was released from the hospital after 5 days of treatment. The mass in the thoracic wall had appeared the previous evening about 8 hours before the patient came to the hospital and kept expanding slowly during his stay in the emergency department. He had pain in his left shoulder, and his left-hand fingers felt cold and tingling with no further neurological symptoms.

Upon her arrival, her body mass index, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oral temperature, and peripheral oxygen saturation in room air were 22.6 kg/m\u00b2, 70 mmHg, 130 beats per minute, 14 breaths per minute, 36.9 \u00b0C, and 98%, respectively. Her skin and mucosal membranes were completely pale, and urinary output was less than 50 cc per hour. She was lethargic, but neurological examination did not reveal any focal neurological deficit and corneal reflex was symmetrically present in both eyes. Obstetrical examination revealed increased fundal height in excess of a term uterus and also uterine hypertonicity. No evidence of ruptured membranes or external vaginal bleeding was evident. Although on digital vaginal examination the cervix was too high posteriorly positioned to be touched by digits, it seemed unripe and closed. Moreover, continuous fetal heart rate monitoring revealed fetal bradycardia. As the patient was hemodynamically unstable, resuscitation was initiated with a bolus of 2 L Ringer\u2019s lactate solution immediately and blood tests were sent. Two units of packed cells were cross-matched. After stabilization, owing to persistent fetal bradycardia, as low as 80 beats per minute, she was emergently transferred to the operating room for cesarean section delivery by impression of massive occult placental abruption. Under general anesthesia, the abdominal cavity was accessed through a low midline incision. We encountered with lateral wall of the uterus and left broad ligament. As the uterus was levorotated approximately 90\u00b0, a severely congested dark-purple uterus with many dilated tortuous vessels on its lower segment was seen and no uterovesical peritoneal reflex could be identified. Subsequently manual exploration revealed an additional 180\u00b0 uterine dextrotorsion. Hence, abdominal wall skin incision was expanded to upper umbilical level and the uterus was detorted. Subsequently, a male baby weighing 1150 g was born through a Kerr uterine incision. Unfortunately, the 1-minute Apgar score was 0 and resuscitation was unsuccessful. Umbilical cord blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.95) and base excess of 16 mmol/L. It is worth noting that, after detorsion, maternal central and peripheral circulation began to improve rapidly and myometrial layer color changed to near normal, but when the uterine wound was closed, the uterus became atonic. Uterotonic agents (0.2 mg of intramuscular methylergonovine plus 30 international units of intravenous oxytocin) were administered, and owing to moderate anemia (hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL) detected in her initial laboratory tests, 2 units of packed cells were transfused. Platelet count, coagulation study (prothrombin time, partial prothrombin time, and fibrinogen level), and liver and kidney function tests were all unremarkable. Fortunately, despite anemia, all other laboratory tests, including serum electrolytes, serum aminotransferase, serum creatinine, and coagulation study, were within normal limits post-operation period, and her hemoglobin level reached 10 g/dL. Interestingly, we could not find any pelvic abnormalities such as congenital anomalies, uterine fibroids, pelvic or adnexal masses, adhesion bands, fetal malpresentation, or any report of vigorous fetal movements prior to symptom onset. However, parietal peritoneum and broad ligaments seemed too loose. In the postoperative period, physical examination and detailed history were taken. No additional significant data were found out except for moderate low back pain; magnetic resonance imaging had revealed lumbar disc herniation 2 years ago. Moreover, her height and body mass index were 1.7 m and 22.6 kg/m\u00b2, respectively; she showed increased skin elasticity, joint hypermobility in upper extremities, and trivial exophthalmos. On vaginal examination based on pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) classification, third-grade anterior and second-grade posterior compartment prolapse were evident; vaginal wall had increased elasticity, and no episiotomy scar or perineal lacerations were observed. In fact, no episiotomy had been made in either vaginal birth, and her previous newborns weighed nearly 3 kg. She received low-molecular-weight heparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily after 24 hours postoperation. On the basis of these systemic manifestations, connective tissue disorders were highly suspected. However, as she was illiterate and living in a remote deprived village, she refused any further investigation, and on the second day postpartum, she was discharged from the hospital on her own request without any complication and was recommended to continue thromboprophylaxis for an additional 7 days. Subsequently, skin sutures were removed on the 12th postoperative day, and she did not come back thereafter. Unfortunately, we were not even able to contact her via phone to have an interview-based follow-up visit. It should be emphasized that, despite refusing to have her pictures taken and undergo further assessments, she gave us informed consent to publish this information.",

    "original_case": "A 36-year-old gravid2 live1 pregnant Iranian woman at the 36th week of her gestation came to Imam Khomeini (Tehran, Iran) Obstetric Emergency Department in March 2021 complaining of subacute visual disturbance. She had well-controlled gestational diabetes (on diet) in her current pregnancy and history of hypothyroidism since 10 years ago, soon after her first delivery, which was well controlled before and during pregnancy by taking 150 microgram oral levothyroxine daily. She also denied any cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption, and she did not take any other medication except for daily levothyroxine, multi-prenatal, and ferrous sulfate tablets (each one tablet per day). She was a housewife living in a small county in Tehran Province with middle socioeconomical status. Regarding her family history, no thromboembolic event or similar visual or neurological disorders had been evident in her first- or second-degree relatives. She had been suffering from decreased vision that she described as central scotoma since 5 days ago. Her first visual attack had lasted for nearly 15 minutes, but thereafter, similar attacks had reoccurred frequently, finally leading to persistent decreased vision since 2 days before her arrival. She had been hospitalized in another center for 2 days. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurologic consult were done there, and the first impression was papillophelebitis at that center, but the patient had discharged home at her own request and referred to our hospital for further assessment. Upon her admission, she was completely conscious, her vital signs were all within normal ranges (blood pressure: 115/75 mmHg, pulse rate: 88 beats/minute, respiratory rate: 14/minute, oral temperature: 36.9 \u00b0C), and she had no complaints of poor signs (headache, nausea, vomiting, and/or epigastric pain) other than visual disturbance. Her body mass index was 24.9 kg/m2, and obstetrical examination was unremarkable (no evidence of uterine contraction or hypertonicity, rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding, or any abnormalities in fetal heart rate tracing). Moreover, reviewing different body systems, sensorimotor neurological examination, gate assessment, lung and heart auscultation, musculoskeletal and dermatological examination, and also liver and spleen palpation (as far as doable due to presence of a large gravid uterus), no pathological findings were revealed. On ophthalmological examination, uncorrected visual acuity was counting fingers at 3-meter distance and 10/10 in her right and left eye, respectively. Direct fundoscopy of the right eye revealed evidence of retinal ischemia and scattered hemorrhages as well as optic disc swelling. Previous brain MRI was reviewed by another radiologist, and no pathologic findings were documented. Furthermore, no abnormalities were found on carotid sonographic examination or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Subsequently, we consulted with an ophthalmologist in Farabi Eye Hospital. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 13 mmHg in both eyes, and there was no abnormal lesion in anterior segment, as well as no vitritis in both eyes. Posterior segment assessment in her right eye revealed evidence of retinal ischemia, cotton-wool spots, and scattered flame-shaped hemorrhages, as well as optic disc swelling (Fig 1 A). The next day, spectral-domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT) confirmed our clinically suspected diagnosis (Fig 2 A, B). According to the ophthalmologist's opinion, as no macular edema was evident, no further interventions or early delivery was necessitated. The ophthalmologist highly recommended us to check thrombophilia disorders or other relevant systemic diseases as potential predisposing factors and also to rule out preeclampsia syndrome. Additionally, they emphasized continuing prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) 40 mg subcutaneously daily, which had been initiated on her admission, and they arranged an outpatient follow-up a week later. As our investigations ruled out potential comorbidities and preeclampsia syndrome (all blood pressure measurements were normal, and there was no abnormality in laboratory tests except for D-dimer and CRP) (), she was discharged home and no drugs except for LMWH were prescribed for an additional 7 days. There were no changes in her symptoms, and visual acuity remained stable at 3-meter counting fingers at 1-week follow-up. Six days later, she experienced labor pain and thus was admitted again at Imam Khomeyni Hospital; due to establishment of active labor, she subsequently underwent an uncomplicated emergency cesarean section through a Pfannesteil skin incision under regional anesthesia, and a 3300-g female newborn with Apgar score of 9 and 10 at the first and fifth minute was delivered. The baby\u2019s height and head circumference were also 51 and 35.5 cm, respectively. Finally, both mother and baby were discharged home 48 hours later without any complications. We strongly recommended her to organize an ophthalmologist\u2019s appointment as soon as possible. Finally, she visited her ophthalmologist 2 weeks after delivery; the follow-up examination and imaging results are shown in Figs. 1 B and 2 C, D. She had improvement in visual acuity to 4/10 and somewhat decrease in retinal findings. At 8-week postpartum follow-up, her visual acuity was 8/10 in the right eye  and ocular coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) was performed, revealing no edema as well as a decrease in vascular density in superior of the macula . She had no complications such as IOP rise or neovascularization. One-year follow-up examination was done by the same ophthalmologist, showing that all hemorrhage and exudate had resolved, while on imaging, no macular edema was seen (Figs. 1 D, 2 F). Moreover, thyroid stimulating hormone, complete blood cell count, and 75-g glucose tolerance test were all within normal limits.",

During the gestational period, she was diagnosed with subchorionic hemorrhage in an emergency examination at 15 gestational weeks and hospitalized for treatment of a threatened premature delivery with oral ritodrine hydrochloride at 33\u201334 gestational weeks. At 40 weeks and 3 days of gestational age, she was hospitalized for labor induction, and after 3 days of oxytocin administration, she had a live birth; the neonate was female, weighed 3140 g, had Apgar scores of 9 and 10, and was delivered via a combination of midline episiotomy, vacuum extraction, and the Kristeller maneuver. However, while removing the placenta, a large mass, including the uterus and placenta, emerged, and a diagnosis was made by vaginal examination and abdominal ultrasonography .\n\nMassive bleeding from the stripped uterine cavity continued, and she presented with a shock index of over 2, a pulse rate of 134 beats per minute (bpm), and a blood pressure of 41/19 mmHg. The patient had a decreased level of consciousness, with a Japan Coma Scale score of 10, namely this patient could be easily aroused by being spoken to, and she had cold extremities. Since laboratory tests revealed minimal hemoglobin, platelet, and fibrinogen levels of 6.6 g/dl, 5.4 \u00d7 10^4/\u03bcl, and 102 mg/dl, respectively, we started rapid blood transfusion and systemic management in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient\u2019s liver and renal function were not abnormal; her serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine levels were 15 units/l, 15 units/l, and 0.48 mg/dl, respectively. Uterine replacement was performed with intravenous nitroglycerine (100 mg), and vaginal bleeding was controlled by Bakri balloon insertion into the recovered uterine cavity, with an iodoform gauze inside the vagina and with sutures of the perineal and vaginal lacerations. However, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) had developed, and the Japanese obstetrical DIC score was 15 points, with a platelet count of 5.4 \u00d7 10^4/\u03bcl, a fibrinogen level of 102 mg/dl, a prothrombin time (PT) of 16.8 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 47.5 seconds, a fibrin degradation product (FDP) level of 97.8 \u03bcg/ml, and d-dimer of 42.0 \u03bcg/ml. Then, we performed contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT; Fig. 2) and uterine artery angiography to detect another source of bleeding related to uterine atony. After these procedures, we decided to perform UAE instead of surgical management to preserve future fertility and avoid the risk of perioperative hemorrhaging secondary to DIC. Finally, transcatheter right-sided UAE was performed to control the pseudo-aneurysmal sac and tortuous vessels of the right uterine artery . On the day of delivery, we rapidly performed blood transfusion, Bakri balloon tamponade, and UAE to control the massive bleeding. Two days later, her condition stabilized, and she was transferred from the ICU to the general ward. We detected a hematoma that was 10 cm in diameter in the left vaginal wall on the same day, so surgical removal with an indwelling catheter in place was performed under general anesthesia on the following day after confirming no active bleeding by contrast-enhanced CT  and explaining the procedure to the patient and her husband. The administration of antibiotics was also needed for 18 days, including 5 days of intravenous administration of cefmetazole (2 g/day) and 13 days of oral cefcapene pivoxil (300 mg/day); however, this catheter was removed, and the vaginal wall hematoma had almost disappeared before discharge.\n\nOverall, we measured approximately 4500 ml of blood loss and performed transfusion of 44 units of red blood cell concentrate (approximately 6160 ml), 30 units of fresh frozen plasma (approximately 3600 ml), and 20 units of platelet concentrate (approximately 400 ml), yet she was able to be discharged 13 days after delivery.

    "original_case": "A 24-year-old Nepalese primigravida with no remarkable personal or family medical history was admitted to our hospital with a platelet count of 97,000/\u00b5L at 12 weeks of gestation. Blood biochemistry analysis revealed elevated levels of platelet associated (PA) immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 214 ng/10^7 cells, while Helicobacter pylori IgG, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen were all negative. There were no findings suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, viral infection, or liver dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with a condition, and her platelet levels were monitored periodically until the end of the second trimester to assess if the platelet count will fall below 30,000/\u00b5L. At 21 weeks of gestation, her platelet count decreased to 30,000/\u00b5L. Additionally, her hemoglobin levels reduced from 12.2 g/dL at 12 weeks to 8.1 g/dL at 23 weeks and eventually to 7.6 g/dL at 27 weeks gestation. Such a decline in hemoglobin was concluded as macrocytic anemia due to a decrease in her vitamin B12 levels; however, oral administration of ferrous citrate and vitamin supplementation were ineffective. No significant abnormalities in the bone marrow were detected through bone marrow puncture. Oral administration of vitamins for anemia was stopped at 31 weeks of gestation. We started administering prednisolone, oral corticosteroid, for thrombocytopenia at 33 weeks of gestation; however, no significant change in platelet count was observed. Therefore, we started blood transfusion therapy, while continuing with 10 mg prednisolone. At the beginning of the 36th and 37th week of pregnancy, 10 units of platelets were transfused each time, which led to an increase in the platelet count from 18,000 to 40,000 and 12,000 to 27,000/\u00b5L, respectively. From the beginning of the 38th week of pregnancy, we administered high-dose immunoglobulin therapy for 5 days; however, the platelet count did not increase enough to support childbirth. Next, we administered romiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, which had no effect on the platelet count. At a platelet count of 9000/\u00b5L, a third round of 10 units of platelet transfusion was performed, but it was ineffective in increasing the platelet count. At this stage, the anti-human leukocyte antigen (anti-HLA) antibody test was positive. To treat the anemia, 2 units of red blood cell fluids were administered, which increased the hemoglobin levels from 6.9 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL. Labor was induced in the patient on the first day of the 39th week of pregnancy. As the platelet count was only 41,000/\u00b5L, before complete dilation of the uterine ostium, 10 units of HLA-matched platelets and 20 units of concentrated platelets were transfused. A female infant weighing 2677 g was delivered vaginally. During the episiotomy suture, another 10 units of platelets were transfused. No hematoma was observed in the birth canal; however, the patient lost almost a liter of blood due to uterine atony. After delivery, the patient\u2019s hemoglobin level was 6.5 g/dL; hence, 4 units of red blood cell fluids were transfused, and dry iron sulfate was administered orally. On the fifth day of puerperium, 15 units of HLA-matched platelets were transfused, as the platelet count was only 26,000/\u00b5L. On the sixth day of puerperium, no significant changes were observed through bone marrow puncture and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the seventh day of puerperium, the platelet count and hemoglobin level recovered to 63,000/\u00b5L and 8.3 g/dL respectively, and the patient was discharged . All oral medications were discontinued on the 29th day of puerperium, when the platelet count was 44,000/\u00b5L and the hemoglobin level reached 10.2 g/dL. The patient was diagnosed with a condition on the 78th day of puerperium, since the platelet count spontaneously recovered to 101,000/\u00b5L. Additionally, mild splenomegaly was observed during the puerperium through transabdominal ultrasonography. Fig. 1 Progress of platelet count and hemoglobin content under treatment details. She developed severe thrombocytopenia and anemia during pregnancy. All medications were ineffective, and she required blood transfusion therapy Full size image The infant's Apgar score was 5 points after 1 min and 7 points after 5 minutes. She had weak breathing and started convulsions 3 minutes after birth. Some other symptoms in the infant included attenuated light reflex, midline fixation of the eyeballs, respiratory depression, and wheezing. Hypertonia and purpura were observed throughout the body, and the epidermal detachment of the face and limbs was remarkable . Additionally, her platelet count was 17,000/\u00b5L, and acute subdural hematoma and hepatosplenomegaly were observed. These symptoms were refractory to therapeutic interventions such as concentrated platelets and immunoglobulins. The infant was diagnosed with a condition at 37 days of age by mass screening, and a homozygous mutation (p.L483R) was found in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. After receiving enzyme replacement therapy at 64 and 78 days of age, she died of suffocation at 82 days of age. The \u03b2-glucosidase activity of the patient and her husband was normal, and a heterozygous mutation in the GBA gene was found in both. Therefore, we diagnosed them as carriers of a condition and provided genetic counseling for future pregnancies including prenatal diagnosis such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling.

Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucosylceramide and other lipid substrates in various tissues and organs, including the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The disease can present with a wide range of symptoms, including hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and skeletal abnormalities. The diagnosis of Gaucher disease is typically made through a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and genetic testing.",

    "original_case": "The patient was a 32-year-old white woman who presented to a specialized combined care program offering obstetrical care and addiction medicine support in a single visit, at 6 weeks gestation in her first pregnancy. She reported using 200\u2013300 Canadian dollars worth of crystal methamphetamine daily via a smoked route. Complicating her presentation was a diagnosis made 2 years prior. She believes she contracted it through sexual activity with a known positive partner. The patient had never been on treatment, and there were no recent viral loads, CD4 counts, or genotypes to guide treatment. She denied other substance use history (alcohol, cocaine, benzodiazepines, opioids including fentanyl and heroin, and cannabis). She did smoke 1 pack of cigarettes per day and had quit smoking after the diagnosis of pregnancy.\n\nThe patient\u2019s psychiatric history included a childhood diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This was diagnosed at the age of 13, when she was started on treatment with extended-release methylphenidate. She continued this medication with significant improvement in her academic function. She continued extended-release methylphenidate until she was 20 years old and decided to stop taking it when she was in university, as she did not like how the medication made her feel and the perceived impacts it had on her personality. She denied any current or past symptoms of anxiety, depression, psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder, or eating disorders. She had no judicial system involvement.\n\nThe patient reported that her main driver for methamphetamine use was reduction in her ADHD-type symptoms, particularly related to organization, concentration, and ability to engage in employment. On becoming pregnant, the patient was able to reduce her methamphetamine use from 200 to 300 Canadian dollars per day to 60 Canadian dollars per day. However, she had difficulty further reducing her use from this amount. She did not think she would be able to remember to take therapy on a regular basis without treatment of her ADHD symptoms and reduction in her methamphetamine use (which required her to spend a great deal of time during the day acquiring and using the substance).\n\nThe risks and benefits of stimulant treatment during pregnancy were reviewed with the patient. The patient provided formal consent to treatment and was aware this was an off-label treatment and provided consent despite limited safety data for lisdexamfetamine in pregnancy.\n\nA contingency management approach requiring the patient to attend the pharmacy daily for observed stimulant therapy was employed. This approach provided carried (take-home) doses of her stimulant for negative urine screens. Weekly urine drug screens were sent to a tertiary care hospital-based laboratory that was able to discern prescription stimulants from illicit methamphetamines. The patient was able to stop illicit methamphetamine use at 15 weeks\u2019 gestation on a daily dose of lisdexamfetamine 30 mg. She obtained full carried doses (one observed dose and six carried doses 20 weeks after starting therapy). This was based on a carry schedule like local methadone programs, where a once weekly carried dose was granted for four weekly negative urine drug screens. Sunday carried doses were provided immediately secondary to limited pharmacy availability.\n\nAs the patient indicated that the daily observed lisdexamfetamine helped with her organization, she started on daily observed ART with a single tablet regimen containing emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir. At initiation of ART, her viral load was 8530 and her CD4 count was 790. The patient\u2019s viral load after 1 month of daily observed emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir was undetectable. She engaged in all weekly appointments for combined obstetrical and addictions care. She received all standard obstetrical care including blood work, immunizations, and ultrasounds. After 20 weeks on daily observed lisdexamfetamine, she was transitioned to six carries with once weekly observed dosing. Her second trimester, third trimester, and labor and delivery blood work revealed an undetectable viral load. Her urine drug screens continued to be consistent with self-reports of no illicit methamphetamine use.\n\nThe patient delivered a male child via spontaneous vaginal delivery at term and received more than 4 hours of zivovudine. His Apgar scores were 8 and 9, and his birthweight was 3255 g. He was followed by a tertiary care neonatal clinic. He received 4 weeks of treatment with zidovudine. Following his newborn and 4-week blood work, he was taken off the antiretrovirals secondary to a negative viral load.\n\nThe patient was followed for 6 weeks postpartum. During this time, the patient continued lisdexamfetamine, and her urine drug screens remained negative in the postpartum period.",

The patient was diagnosed with a malignancy and another cancer simultaneously 7 years prior. Bilateral extended thyroidectomy was first performed, and the malignancy was confirmed by pathology. She then developed hypothyroidism and routinely took l-thyroxine 100 \u03bcg/day as replacement therapy. Three months after thyroidectomy, she underwent modified radical mastectomy of the right breast with lymph node dissection. The pathological results were categorized as stage IIIB according to the AJCC 8th edition standards. The immunochemical staining showed specific receptor statuses, and the fraction of Ki-67-positive cells was nearly 30%. After surgery, she was successively administered chemotherapy, irradiation, and endocrine therapy. Zoledronic acid had been regularly injected every 6 months for 5 years. Local ultrasound and serum tumor markers on follow-up remained in the normal range during this period. Unfortunately, systemic osseous metastasis was found 1.5 years before current admission by PET-CT inspection, and additional treatment was then initiated. Simultaneously, intermittent endocrine therapy and zoledronic acid injection were administered. Laboratory reports from 7 months prior to this admission showed that her fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 5.5 mmol/L and her hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 6.3%. Both values are within the normal range. She did not take any medications other than the above prescriptions in the prior 1.5 years. Her blood pressure was 126/90 mmHg, and her body mass index (BMI) was 20.12 kg/m\u00b2 at admission. Palmar\u2013plantar erythrodysesthesia was obvious , and we categorized it as grade 3 according to the definition of the National Cancer Institute. Chest radiology and Doppler echocardiography showed normal pulmonary and cardiac function. The plasma level of pro-BNP was also normal (265 pg/mL).

She had no significant medical history but reported 15-pound unintentional weight loss over the past 6 months. However, her abdomen grew in size during the same period. At time of admission, her abdomen was distended, and a 3/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border. Laboratory values were significant for leukocytosis to 17.5 \u00d7 10^3/MCL (normal 4.0\u201310.5 \u00d7 10^3/MCL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 273 U/L (normal 13\u201339 U/L), alanine transaminase (ALT) 149 U/L (normal 7\u201352 U/L), and cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) 4663 U/ML (normal < 35 U/ML). Urinalysis was positive for protein, ketones, and red blood cells.\n\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 13-cm complex cystic mass in the left adnexa with moderate hyperdense ascites and omental nodularity, suspicious for ovarian neoplasm with carcinomatosis (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated a large left adnexal complex cystic structure with internal echoes . Chest CT did not reveal any intrathoracic neoplastic or infectious process. On diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, 700 mL of brownish opaque fluid was drained and sent for culture and cytology, which later revealed benign histocytes and mesothelial cells.\n\nFig. 1 Large left pelvic hypodense structure (yellow arrow) drained by left gonadal vein (red arrow).

The left ovary was found to be completely replaced by a cyst with a thickened outer rind deeply adherent to the pelvic wall. The cyst had a small ruptured area superiorly. Brown deposits were present on the cyst as well as the omentum and various peritoneal compartments sampled. Biopsy of the anterior abdominal wall was obtained, which later revealed a minute fragment of fibrous tissue with few pigmented macrophages and benign mesothelial cells.\n\nGiven that this patient had completed childbearing, she elected to undergo a modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal biopsies. Pathologic evaluation of the endometrium, myometrium, cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, peritoneum, omentum, and paracolic spaces demonstrated fibromuscular tissue with hemosiderin-laden macrophages and chronic inflammation suggestive of multiple foci .

Prior to presentation, the patient had placed his penis through a steel hexagon nut for sexual enhancement but was not able to remove the nut after masturbation. On examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable, conscious, and oriented. The patient complained of difficulty with urination and decreased sensation to his genitalia. The patient was uncircumcised, and paraphimosis was present on examination. The metallic nut was located on the penile shaft approximately 5 cm from the distal penis. Physical examination demonstrated that the shaft of the penis, which was distal to the steel nut, was edematous and congested, and the patient reported decreased sensation distally to the entrapping foreign body. There were no signs of necrosis in the glans or distal penile shaft. The initial examination is demonstrated in Fig. 1. This case is typically a grade III penile injury according to the Bhat classification and low-grade injury according to the Silberstein classification () [6, 11]. Fig. 1 Steel hexagon nut encircling phallus Full size image  Summary of grading system for penile incarceration [6, 11] Full size table Following initial evaluation, urgent management placed an intravenous line, and the patient was given analgesics, sedatives, and antibiotics. The patient was not in urinary retention, thus we elected not to attempt to place a urinary catheter. Manual decompression and attempts using lubricant to remove the nut were unsuccessful due to the degree of penile swelling in the distal penis. It was impossible to cut the nut off using a standard bolt cutter as there was no space between the nut and the penile edematous skin. To address this, the use of a dental handpiece was considered, and a dental colleague was consulted by phone. The patient was transferred to the dental clinic in our hospital. The thick metallic nut was removed carefully utilizing a diamond drill in a dental handpiece . The procedure lasted for approximately 45 minutes with continuous water irrigation to prevent thermal injury to the penis (Additional file 1: Video 1). We used mainly a handheld rotating electric drill to make progress; however, a small plastic blade was also used throughout the procedure to protect the penile skin from the abrasive drill . After cutting through it at two points, the nut was dislodged from the middle of the penis without damage to the underlying penile skin. The patient was comfortable throughout the procedure. The metal nut measured 2.7 cm in inner diameter, 4.1 cm in outer diameter, and 2.2 cm in thickness; the split nut is shown in Fig. 4 following successful removal. After the nut was removed from the penis, the distal penis was flaccid, the paraphimosis was reduced, and the patient was able to spontaneously void, and the prior distal penile edema and congestion resolved spontaneously .

The baby\u2019s mother had prenatal care\u2009\u00d7\u200912 visits. She had a fetal echocardiography done at 32 weeks 5 days gestation, for a fetal arrhythmia. The echo showed two small echogenic, RV apex and septal masses . Next, her third trimester prenatal ultrasound showed oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index, AFI 4.86). Prior to delivery, the patient\u2019s mother was group B Strep (GBS) positive; she received six doses of intrapartum penicillin. After an uncomplicated birth, the baby was admitted to the NICU for postnatal cardiac evaluation and concerns. In view of the prenatal fetal echocardiogram findings, multiple pediatric specialties (pediatric cardiology, neurology, and pediatric ophthalmology) were consulted and involved in the infant\u2019s care. After admission, the infant had a brown-colored emesis episode, and he was made nothing by mouth (NPO). A gastric lavage was performed, and intravenous fluids were started. No further emesis episodes were observed, and PO (by mouth) feeds were soon started, and gradually increased. The infant tolerated full PO enteral feeds well for the rest of the hospital stay without further concerns. In view of the prenatal fetal echocardiogram findings, an electrocardiogram (EKG) and transthoracic echocardiogram were performed. The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, and the EKG was normal for age. These masses appeared smaller in the postnatal than on the prenatal echocardiogram evaluation (per the echo report, the cardiologist could not appreciate the dimensions of the tumors). There was no cardiac inflow or outflow obstruction, and normal cardiac structure and function were reported. There were no cardiac rhythm abnormalities. During the 4-day hospital course, the infant remained hemodynamically stable and well. Pediatric cardiology recommended infant reevaluation and imaging in 3\u20134 months. Imaging could be performed earlier if the size of the cardiac masses [2] caused hemodynamic instability. Next, a pediatric neurology consultation was obtained, reporting an unremarkable examination. The infant did not have any dermatological findings, with no hypopigmented or hyperpigmented lesions. Also, cranial and renal ultrasounds were performed and were unremarkable. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and the patient did not have any intracranial manifestations. Next, genetic testing was performed (panel), and a pediatric genetic appointment was scheduled in 1\u20132 months. Pediatric ophthalmology was consulted to rule out ocular involvement. Pediatric ophthalmology reported no abnormalities, well-formed eyes, bilateral anterior segment within normal limits, bilateral D/M/V (disc, macula, vessels) within normal limits, and zone 3 retinal vascularization. Pediatric ophthalmology recommended follow-up in 1 month. Throughout the entire 4-day NICU course, the infant remained on room air, and he maintained adequate oxygen saturation. He had stable vitals with no tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmia, or hypotensive episodes. He was active and was easily aroused. He had symmetric and adequate upper/lower extremity tone, and he had appropriate deep tendon reflexes since admission. No abnormal movements or seizure-like activity was observed, and he tolerated PO feeds well. At the time of discharge, outpatient follow-up appointments were arranged with the primary pediatrician, genetics, pediatric cardiology, pediatric neurology, pediatric ophthalmology, and dermatology.

Gynecologic and obstetric history were gravida 2, para 2 (G2P2), with two healthy children. The onset of menopause was at the age of 51 years. She was a widow, lived alone, and was a former schoolteacher retired since the age of 65 years. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. Her medications were: perindopril (oral route) 4 mg once a day, metformin (oral route) 500 mg two times a day, and insulin glargine injection 100 units/mL, 16 IU once a day at the same time. She was hospitalized in our medical unit within the emergency department for pyelonephritis associated with a moderate deterioration of the serum creatinine from 114 \u03bcmol/L to 139 \u03bcmol/L (normal range 50\u2013100 \u03bcmol/L). Her initial vital signs included RR of 19 breaths per minute, HR of 112 beats per minute with regular pulse, and blood pressure (BP) of 107/59 mmHg with mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 75 mmHg. Initial clinical examination of this patient revealed that she had a temperature of 38.9 \u00b0C with sweating, unilateral left flank pain, and nausea. Cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological examinations were normal. Laboratory investigations indicated a bacterial infection with procalcitonin of 0.56 \u00b5g/L and white blood cell count of 24.0 \u00d7 10^3/mm^3 (normal range 4\u201310 \u00d7 10^3/mm^3) including 21.6 \u00d7 10^3/mm^3 neutrophils. Initial arterial lactate was 1.90 mmol/L. Other blood tests were within the reference range (). Urine dipstick test confirmed a urinary tract infection with positive dipstick hematuria, and leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests returned positive. The treatment consisted of intravenous administration of cefotaxime 1 g/8 hours antibiotic and 0.9% saline 500 mL over a period of 30 minutes and then 1000 mL/12 hours, and pain and fever management. HR was 91 beats per minute, blood pressure 135/79 mmHg (MAP 98 mmHg), and serum lactate 1.3 mmol/L after treatment. Remote continuous monitoring was used in the ward to monitor the patient in real time (Figure 1A) in addition to the nursing monitoring, which included the measurement of vital signs every 8 hours. Remote monitoring does not replace nursing monitoring, which also records the assessment of pain and other patient complaints as well as delivering care. By using a patch worn on the patient chest associated with an axillary temperature sensor, smart algorithms continuously process and analyze vital signs. The E-health technology aimed to generate targeted notifications of patient deterioration. The objective was to detect a possible deterioration of the vital signs in the time periods between the manual monitoring by the nurses in the hospital setting. In addition to regular monitoring on standard Personal Computer (PC) stations (Fig. 1B and C), surveillance was also conducted by iPad (Apple). iPads were attached to trolleys used by nurses, allowing them to continually monitor all patients while doing rounds . In the present case, the emergency nurse and physician received an alert by email and the Sensium application on 29 August 2018 at 12:56 pm indicating a sudden increase of HR from 115 to 140 beats per minute, an increased RR from 22 to 35 breaths per minute, and an elevated temperature of 39.6 \u00b0C (Fig. 2A and B). Computed tomography (CT) scan was carried out and found multiple foci of nephritis of the upper pole of the right kidney. No dilatation of the pyelocaliceal cavities or obstruction of the urinary excretory tract was seen . Upon manual monitoring, clinical examination, and biological tests, a diagnosis was made on the basis of the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score calculation. SOFA was 6: Coma Glasgow Score (CGS) 14, BP 97/48 mmHg (MAP 64 mmHg), Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 76 mmHg and PaO2/The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 362, deterioration of the serum creatinine from 139 to 172 \u03bcmol/L, and platelet count 141,000/\u00b5L. There was no bilirubin abnormality. Therapeutic reinforcement was performed with oxygen therapy 2 L per minute because PaO2/FiO2 ratio was < 400; a single daily dose of amikacin 30 mg/kg (1800 mg intravenous injection over a period of 30 minutes) in addition to cefotaxime 2 g intravenous injection, 1 L of isotonic crystalloid 0.9% saline in 15 minutes because MAP was < 70 mmHg; and paracetamol 1 g intravenously. This treatment improved her clinical condition and reversed vital distress at 02:32 pm with HR of 112 beats per minute and RR of 22 breaths per minute (Fig. 2B and C). She was admitted to the intensive care unit. Blood culture and cytobacteriological examination of urine found Escherichia coli [10^6 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL] with established sensitivity to third-generation broad-spectrum bactericidal cephalosporin antibiotics (). Treatment with cefotaxime 6 g per day was continued at a dosage of 2 g/8 hours intravenously. Her vital signs stabilized within 2 days, and she returned to a lower acute ward: HR 90 beats per minute, RR 17 breaths per minute, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 15, MAP 87 mmHg, PaO2 91 mmHg, serum creatinine 116 \u03bcmol/L, and platelet count 183,000/\u00b5L. Antibiotic was changed at the fifth day for ciprofloxacin twice a day (every 12 hours) in the morning and evening, based on the antibiogram (). After 8 days of hospitalization, the patient was allowed to return home with treatment by ciprofloxacin twice a day (every 12 hours) in the morning and evening for a duration of 7 days.

She also reported resumption of normal menstruation. Repeated pituitary MRI showed a significant reduction in tumor size (2.1 \u00d7 1.7 \u00d7 2.9 cm\u00b3). However, despite adhering to the treatment, she never achieved normoprolactinemia. PEG precipitation for macroprolactin ruled out macroprolactinemia with 99% recovery. After 11 months of treatment, her prolactin continued to rise despite uptitration of her cabergoline to 3.5 mg weekly . A repeat pituitary MRI showed an increased tumor size (2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 3.4 cm\u00b3), with the tumor compressing the hypothalamus, while the optic chiasm and pituitary stalk were not visualized. She was otherwise asymptomatic. Failing medical therapy, she underwent transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), whereby intraoperatively, 30% of the tumor at the suprasellar anterior part was unresectable, as the tumor was tough and adherent to the underlying structure. Histopathology examination (HPE) revealed extensive perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, mitotic activity of 8/10 HPF, and Ki-67 proliferative index of 4\u20135%. Fig. 1 Trend of prolactin level Full size image Under close monitoring, her prolactin remained elevated despite cabergoline dosage of 3.5 mg/week. Her menstruation ceased, and she developed recurrent right temporal hemianopia and worsening VA. The pituitary MRI  showed an increased tumor size (3.5 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 2.7 cm\u00b3) with a prolactin level of 114,235 \u00b5IU/mL. She underwent a second TSS procedure with postoperative HPE staining that was positive for synaptophysin and negative for GFAP, EMA, and NB84. The mitotic activity was 2\u20133/10 HPF, and the Ki-67 proliferative index was > 3\u20134%. Postoperatively, her prolactin dropped to 24,692 \u00b5IU/mL. However, she remained amenorrheic and was started on hormone replacement therapy as well as thyroxine replacement due to the development of TSH deficiency (free T4 10.83 pmol/L). Fig. 2 Postoperative sagittal and coronal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging pituitary performed after the first transsphenoidal surgery. The magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pituitary lesion with residual mass (size 3.5 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 2.7 cm\u00b3) seen mainly in the right suprasellar region (white arrow) Full size image Unfortunately, her disease continued to progress, showing an increased tumor size (2.6 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3.7 cm\u00b3) with larger sellar and suprasellar components and mass effects . Her prolactin level remained high (91,603 \u00b5IU/mL) despite being on cabergoline 0.75 mg daily, which was further titrated up to 1 mg daily. Her visual impairment worsened with bitemporal hemianopia and right RAPD. A decision was made to perform a third surgery via a transcranial approach to gain better access to the suprasellar portion of the tumor. Intraoperatively, there was remnant of the tumor in the right superior region extended towards the hypothalamus and the third ventricular floor, which was unresectable due to firm adherence to the surrounding brain. Fig. 3 Preoperative sagittal and coronal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging pituitary performed prior to the third debulking surgery. MRI revealed an increased tumor size (2.6 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 3.7 cm\u00b3) with a larger suprasellar component (white arrow) compressing towards the corpus callosum, lateral ventricle, and third ventricle Full size image Postoperative pituitary MRI showed a smaller pituitary mass measuring 2.6 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 3.0 cm\u00b3, and prolactin levels were stable at 45,000 \u00b5IU/mL on cabergoline 1 mg daily. A multidisciplinary team meeting with neurosurgery, radiology, oncology, and endocrinology teams was conducted. Considering the patient\u2019s young age, the proximity of the tumor to the left optic nerve, and the resistance of the tumor to both medical and surgical therapy, which suggested tumor aggressiveness, the patient is planned for temozolomide (TMZ) therapy with a view for radiotherapy pending assessment of the tumor\u2019s response to TMZ. TMZ (220 mg daily for 5 days per month) was initiated in November 2021 for six cycles. Aside from mild nausea, she tolerated the TMZ therapy well.",

    "original_case": "A 12-year-old Italian boy, 34 kg body weight, was referred to the PED with a 24-hour history of intermittent chest pain, cough, wheezing, and mild fever. His medications prior to arrival consisted of 0.2 mg of inhaled salbutamol every 3 hours, initiated the previous day without medical advice (overall 1.4 mg/24 hours). The last administration had been performed 1 hour before arrival. No inciting exercise was reported, and use of hypoallergenic material was reported in his bedroom. Salbutamol inhaler had been prescribed by his pneumologist as part of patient\u2019s asthma action plan. Noteworthily, montelukast treatment was discontinued 5 days earlier on the advice of his pneumologist, after a 3-month period without asthma exacerbations. Past medical history included intermittent asthma induced by exercise and by dust mites diagnosed 1 year earlier. Only one mild exacerbation occurred 9 months following diagnosis, which did not require hospitalization. At that time, hypoallergenic material was not available in his bedroom. At presentation, vital signs were as follows: heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 38 breaths per minute, 94% oxygen saturation on room air, and temperature 37.1 \u00b0C. Physical examination showed intercostal and substernal retractions, diffuse reductions in normal breath sound, and end-expiratory wheezing. His ability to speak was not affected. A pediatric asthma score of 9 was then calculated. Blood gas test results at presentation as well as other blood examination results and vital signs are listed in . \n\nThe patient was treated with 40 mg intravenous methylprednisolone and 3.75 mg (0.11 mg/kg) nebulized salbutamol together with 0.5 mg ipratropium bromide at 20-minute intervals. Three oxygen-driven nebulizations were performed because of persistent wheezing, retractions, and moderate hypoxia (oxygen saturation between 90% and 95% on room air). Five minutes after the end of the third nebulization, a presyncope episode occurred. At onset, vital signs were normal, apart from tachycardia (140 beats per minute); on physical examination, he had tremor in his hands, looked pale, and was eupneic, with normal breath sounds and weak radial pulse. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained, together with blood samples, showing normal troponin-T serum level. Therefore, a normal saline infusion was started. Clinical conditions swiftly worsened in the following 30 minutes as the patient suffered faintness, extreme pallor, and cold extremities. His vital signs revealed 84% oxygen saturation on room air, hypotension (90/40 mmHg), and tachycardia (140 beats per minute). A blood gas test was conducted, showing metabolic acidosis with elevated blood lactate levels, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. As these findings were consistent with \u03b22-receptor-agonist side effects, salbutamol was discontinued. Consequently, two boluses of Ringer\u2019s acetate were administered, each over 20 minutes, because of persistent hypotension; hypokalemia was treated with 500 mL normal saline and 40 mEq/L of potassium chloride at 70 mL/hour rate of infusion in 3 hours; oxygen supplementation was started with Venturi mask providing a maximum FiO2 of 0.3. The patient was subsequently admitted to our intensive observation unit. During the observation period, the patient remained eupneic without expiratory wheezing. Hypokalemia quickly reverted, whereas lactic acidosis (peak concentration 8.1 mmol/L) and lower DBP persisted for a longer time. Oxygen supplementation was discontinued overnight, maintenance normal saline was continued, and diuresis remained normal. Fluid boluses had been stopped because of persistent lower DBP with normal systolic blood pressure. Ipratropium bromide was administered alone as bronchodilator treatment at 4-hour intervals. Twenty-four hours later, another 12-lead ECG was performed (sinus rhythm, normal QTc). A pediatric cardiology consultation excluded any evidence of compromised left ventricular function and cardiac output and suggested that the aforementioned ECG alterations might have had a multifactorial origin (mild fever, hypokalemia, and \u03b22-agonist toxicity).",

Family history was only positive for constipation in the patient\u2019s father. The patient lived at home with his parents and sister and had no financial, language, or cultural challenges. Upon admission, the patient\u2019s physical exam was within normal limits and, particularly, his abdomen was soft, nondistended, nontender to palpation with no masses. He was diagnosed with a condition, which was successfully reduced by radiology via water-soluble contrast enema. The following day, he had persistent symptoms and was taken for repeat contrast enema to evaluate for recurrence. The contrast enema was negative for recurrence, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained for further evaluation. CT scan did not demonstrate the condition, but raised concern for small bowel obstruction with compromised bowel. At this time, the patient\u2019s physical exam continued to be within normal limits, but he subjectively appeared uncomfortable with increased fussiness and agitation. Given the patient\u2019s history, there was concern for recurrence requiring operative reduction. The patient underwent operative exploration and was found to have the condition in his terminal ileum. This was manually reduced but noted to have necrotic small bowel which was resected with a primary, end-to-end anastomosis, and an appendectomy was performed. The pathology report postoperatively described the specimen as being from the small intestine with ischemic necrosis along with an intraluminal fibrin and fragments of necrotic bowel mucosa.\n\nThe patient\u2019s course was complicated by an anastomotic leak along with three small bowel perforations on hospital day 6 requiring an exploratory laparotomy with abdominal washout, small bowel resections, and temporary abdominal closure. Pathology showed segments of small intestine with patchy ischemic necrosis, serositis, and numerous transmural defects. He was taken back 2 days later for end ileostomy with mucous fistula creation. Total small bowel resected was 20\u201330 cm.\n\nDuring his postoperative course, the patient was initially treated with IV ceftriaxone and metronidazole followed by ceftazidime and metronidazole. He was placed on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and remained on this for 10 days. He was also started on antimicrobial therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. He was discharged on hospital day 21 with a home PICC line and TPN. He was seen in the outpatient clinic 1 week later and was tolerating oral feeds. He was seen again 2 weeks later and was tolerating full feeds. He was seen 1 month later and was doing well.",

He was receiving endodontic (root canal) therapy on a maxillary molar tooth. He recalled experiencing two episodes of excessive coughing and dyspnea, lasting several minutes each. Following the coughing, the dentist noted that an object was missing. He was promptly referred to the ED for investigation of a potentially ingested or aspirated object. His previous medical history included ischemic heart disease which was managed pharmacologically. Physical assessment revealed stable observations, normal bronchial and vesicular breath sounds with no signs of respiratory distress, cough, dysphagia, abdominal pain, or vomiting. An examination of the oral cavity was normal, suggesting passage of the foreign body beyond the oropharynx.\n\nFig. 1 Endodontic files (top left), rubber dam clamp (top right), rubber dam (bottom) [17] Full size image Frontal chest and abdominal radiographic imaging confirmed the presence of a 27-mm linear radiopaque foreign body located to the right of the midline of the abdomen, approximately at the level of the L2/3 disc . General surgical opinion at the time advised inspection and removal via gastroscopy, however by the time this was organized a new abdominal radiograph showed migration of the foreign body to the distal ileum/ascending colon, beyond the scope of endoscopic retrieval .

He had a past medical history of tobacco abuse with a 60-pack-year smoking history without any other pertinent medical and family history. At initial presentation, the patient was seen at an urgent care with complaints of a new skin nodule on his right upper back. The patient was referred to dermatology via urgent care, but the patient was lost to follow up. Two months later, it grew and ulcerated, prompting a surgical consult by his PCP for biopsy and excision . The ulcerated skin lesion became painful and developed purulent drainage requiring antibiotics. During this time, he also noticed weight loss, loss of appetite, and worsening constipation. He denied coughing, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, or any other respiratory symptoms. On physical examination he had normal vital signs and was cachectic. He had a post excision wound on the right upper back measuring about 10 cm in greatest diameter surrounded by mild erythema with sutures in place . No drainage was noted. He had three palpable, non-tender and freely mobile right posterior cervical lymphadenopathy measuring 2 cm\u2009\u00d7\u20092 cm in size. On auscultation of lungs, he had equal air entry bilaterally and was without wheezes or crackles. Otherwise, he had a unremarkable physical exam including normal cardiac exam. Lab work revealed hypercalcemia of 16.3 mg/dL, which was corrected for his albumin. PTHrP was elevated with a low normal PTH. Renal function was normal (). Chest x-ray revealed a large cavitary lesion in the right upper lung lobe and right hilar adenopathy or a mass . CT chest with contrast showed extensive malignancy most significantly involving the mediastinum, right hilum, and right upper lobe with areas of interstitial thickening and nodularity in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe and Indeterminate partially exophytic mass in the posterior upper right chest measuring about 3.8\u2009\u00d7\u20096.2 cm . He underwent bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound which showed a large subcarinal mass and a small fixed, friable, irregular, oval and vascular lesion with less than 25% obstruction in the right main stem . The histopathology report of the skin lesion was consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, mainly invading the dermis and subcutaneous tissue with no dysplastic changes in the epidermis. Smaller nodules were also invading the angiolymphatic vessels. The sections of surgical margins were free of tumor cells. Bronchial washings and FNA of hilar lymph node pathology results confirmed non-small cell carcinoma favoring squamous cell carcinoma. They stained positive for p40 and negative for TTF1. The tumor cells PD-L1 membranous positivity was 5%. Our patient had LSCC and nonkeratinizing SCC in his skin biopsy which made it more likely that it was Stage IV LSCC with metastasis to the skin than a primary cutaneous tumor in addition to the primary pulmonary tumor.

The hypercalcemia was resolved with intravenous fluid resuscitation and zoledronic acid. Oncology evaluated the patient and planned to start chemotherapy and immunotherapy as outpatient. No therapeutic intervention or further work-up was completed as the patient\u2019s clinical and functional status severely declined during his hospital stay and was later discharged with hospice. His baseline functional status prior to admission was being able to do activities of daily living independently and ambulated on his own.

Especially since the patient presented with a fungating lesion without pulmonary symptoms which led investigations towards primary dermatologic cancer. The elevated calcium and PTHrP were the first diagnostic clues which started the diagnostic workup for lung cancer. Before the pulmonary workup, it was thought that the patient had a basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which was pending a biopsy report after surgical excision at that time.

    "original_case": "An 82-year-old Caucasian male retired ex-gymnast from home presented with a 2-week history of acute on chronic lower back pain without a clear precipitant. The pain was exacerbated when weight-bearing, causing the man to collapse to the floor in pain. There were no associated fevers, sweats, or neurological symptoms. The patient\u2019s past medical history included spinal osteoarthritis with an L2\u2013S1 decompression laminectomy and fusion with transpedicular screws and spinal rods last revised in 2008, C4\u2013C5 decompressive laminectomy and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in 1992\u20131994, and bilateral hip replacement in 2005. The patient\u2019s pain was managed by his general practitioner, he was taking pregabalin 150\u2009mg twice a day, buprenorphine patch 5\u2009mg per hour weekly, and codeine 30\u2009mg for pain flares. There was no history of recent dental procedures, infections, or other surgeries. There was no history of immunodeficiency or corticosteroid use. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank up to two standard drinks of alcohol occasionally on weekends. On physical examination in the emergency department, his vital signs were unremarkable, with heart rate 90 beats per minute, blood pressure 135/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, and temperature of 36.5\u2009\u00b0C. On palpation, he was moderately tender generally at the L4 and L5 vertebrae, and unable to complete a straight leg raise owing to pain when raising his leg. There were no remarkable neurological, respiratory, or cardiac findings. On assessment in the emergency department, his full blood count (white cell count 9.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L), C-reactive protein (CRP; < 0.7\u2009mg/L), and renal function blood tests were within normal limits and unremarkable. A computed tomography scan (CT) of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated advanced degenerative changes. He was admitted under the geriatric team for analgesia and allied health assessment with a provisional diagnosis of acute on chronic flare in degenerative osteoarthritis. Two days into his admission, a septic screen was performed when he spiked a temperature of 38 \u00b0C and exhibited tachycardia of 112 beats per minute and hypotension of 90 mmHg systolic. His blood tests revealed a CRP of 279 mg/L with a white cell count of 9.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L, and the patient was commenced on empirical intravenous ceftriaxone 2\u2009g 24-hourly. An urgent lumbosacral MRI performed on the same day revealed no features of discitis or epidural abscesses. An abdominal portovenous CT scan was performed to investigate for a possible gastrointestinal source, as well as pelvic and femoral X-rays of the hip prosthesis looking for evidence of osteomyelitis, but all were unremarkable. All four blood cultures taken during the septic screen revealed Veillonella species. An infectious disease consultation was requested following the initial MRI, and the antibiotic regimen was changed to intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5\u2009g 8-hourly. In addition to the lower back pain, the patient was also developing new right knee pain. On examination, there was general joint tenderness and reduced range of movement due to pain; although it was unclear if this pain was due to the patient\u2019s known osteoarthritis or underlying infective cause. To investigate for disseminated infection, a whole-body bone scan single-photon emission computerized tomography was performed 4 days later and demonstrated evidence of T12\u2013L1 discitis and features of osteomyelitis in the right tibial plateau. Repeat lumbosacral and right knee MRI 5 days following first MRI demonstrated a T10\u2013L1 effacing epidural phlegmon, T10\u2013T12 discitis, bilateral psoas abscesses (the largest extending from L1\u2013L4), and right tibial plateau osteomyelitis . Transthoracic echo identified small vegetations on the mitral and tricuspid valves. Further investigation with transesophageal echo was not performed as the patient was deemed unsuitable for cardiothoracic intervention owing to his age. His right psoas abscess was drained percutaneously, and microscopy, culture, and sensitivity of the abscess aspirate did not demonstrate significant bacterial growth. Sensitivities to the blood cultured Veillonella species confirmed sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and metronidazole but resistance to penicillin. The patient was recommenced on intravenous ceftriaxone daily, leading to improvement in his back and knee symptoms. He was discharged on oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid 875\u2009mg/125\u2009mg 12-hourly for 6\u2009months. The primary source of this patient\u2019s infection remains unclear. On follow-up, the patient made a full recovery after 6\u2009months, and returned to his baseline level of function and mobility without evidence of infection reoccurrence.

The patient then sought treatment and underwent a nasopharyngeal swab test, with a positive result. Afterward, she received treatment at the closest healthcare facility (day 3) and was treated with oseltamivir, azithromycin, steroids, vitamin C, and zinc for 5 days. The patient felt that her symptoms had resolved after she had taken her medication. On day 14, the patient underwent another nasopharyngeal swab test, and the result was still positive; therefore, she returned for self-isolation. On day 17, the patient started experiencing pain throughout her body without any respiratory symptoms. On day 18, she had the same symptoms; mid-day, the patient could still communicate with her family about her symptoms, but then she did not remember any of the subsequent events. Based on the information provided by her family member, they found that within approximately 4 hours after the patient complained of pain throughout her body, she started to become verbally aggressive and had a fever of 39 \u00b0C. She also had urinary incontinence without any motor seizures. Any history of comorbidities, alcohol intake, or substance abuse was denied. The patient was then taken by her family to the Emergency Department of Pondok Indah \u2013 Bintaro Jaya Hospital. When she was admitted to the Emergency Department, she did not have a fever (body temperature 36.5 \u00b0C), her pulse rate was 85 beats/min, her blood pressure was 136/65 mmHg, her respiratory rate was 19 breaths/minute, and her oxygen saturation on room air was 97%. The patient was in the obese category (BMI 43.8 kg/m2) with body weight of 115 kg and height of 162 cm. Her general status was within normal limits. Neurological examination revealed altered consciousness (GCS of E3M5V3) with a propensity for fluctuation and aggressive behavior. Cranial and motor nerve examination found no lateralization. It was difficult to evaluate meningeal irritation signs at this time. Laboratory examination revealed leukocytosis (17,900/UL), neutrophilia (84%), relative lymphopenia (10.1%), increased C-reactive protein level (25.75 mg/L), and increased D-dimer level (600 ng/mL). Evaluation of anti-HIV, HbSAg, and anti-HCV showed nonreactive results. RT\u2013PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples showed positive results. Chest X-ray revealed diffuse ground-glass opacity of the left lung with suspected etiology of asymmetrical lung edema and a differential diagnosis of left pleural effusion and left lung pneumonia. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a normal image; i.e., no lesion or intracerebral or intracerebellar pathological enhancement was found. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid sample obtained from lumbar puncture revealed that the cerebrospinal fluid was clear and colorless. Pleocytosis was found (leukocyte count 157/\u00b5L) with 99% mononuclear and 1% polymorphonuclear cells, with increased protein levels (108 mg/dL), while the glucose level was within the normal limit (glucose level in cerebrospinal fluid 63 mg/dL, serum glucose level 104 mg/dL). Gram and Ziehl Neelsen staining revealed no bacteria or acid-fast bacilli (AFB). PCR examination for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) showed negative results, while RT\u2013PCR for SARS-CoV-2 revealed positive results. The patient was admitted to the SARS-CoV-2 isolation unit. Primary care was started in the Emergency Department, including nasogastric tube and Foley catheter insertion and nasal cannula as well as intravenous fluid supplementation. The patient received empiric treatment based on her clinical manifestation using 750 mg acyclovir three times daily, as her prior PCR result on cerebrospinal fluid samples showed viral encephalitis. The treatment was also continued using intravenous remdesivir at a dosage of 200 mg once daily on the first day, which was continued at 100 mg once daily from the second to fifth day. The patient also received 40 mg methylprednisolone twice daily and 0.4 cc enoxaparine sodium.",

The operation was performed under general anesthesia. After creating a large collar incision (12 cm length) two-finger width above the suprasternal notch, subplatysmal flaps were created as a routine thyroidectomy procedure. The raphe between strap muscles was opened, and the muscles were incised on the left near the upper pole of the thyroid. On initial evaluation after the thyroid was exposed, it appeared as a mass displacing the carotid sheath laterally and extending into the mediastinum as a retrosternal goiter. However, further evaluation showed a central posterior neck mass with extension to mediastinum that displaced carotid sheath laterally and the left lobe of the thyroid superior and medially. The inferior thyroidal artery crossed the mass toward the carotid sheath. These findings favored an origin from the superior parathyroid glands. The inferior thyroid artery was ligated as laterally as possible, and then the lateral side of the tumor was dissected out with sharp and blunt dissection, and the tumor was pulled out of the mediastinum to the neck . The recurrent laryngeal nerve was explored between the trachea and medial side of the tumor, that is, the mass was located dorsal to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (further evidence of superior parathyroid origin of the tumor). Fig 2 Surgical view of the mass obscuring the thyroid gland (right) and dissection (left) Full size image Owing to the PTH value, size of the tumor, and adhesion to adjacent tissues, the patient was diagnosed with a significant condition, and the tumor, right lobe of the thyroid, and adjacent lymph nodes were resected.

    "original_case": "Initial clinical examinations and genetic testing\nPreoperative tests, including corneal topography utilizing a Zeiss ATLAS 9000 (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), were performed on a 44-year-old Caucasian male patient considering CLRS. The patient did not have medical, family, or psychosocial history that could indicate predisposition or existence of corneal abnormalities, nor did he show any symptoms that could suggest corneal aberrations. Moreover, the patient had never undergone previous eye interventions. No financial, language, or cultural challenges occurred regarding the management of this case. The results from the initial presentation (T = 0) (that is, topographic examination) did not indicate corneal abnormalities in either eye of the patient (Fig 1), nor any other ocular pathologies. For GP, a buccal mucosa sample was collected by using an iSWAB collection kit (Mawi DNA Technologies, Hayward, CA, USA). After DNA was extracted (QIAamp DNA mini kit, QIAGEN Inc. Hilden, Germany) from the sample, a next-generation sequencing (NGS) test (AvaGen, Avellino Lab, Menlo Park, CA, USA) targeting 75 genes specific to the structure and health of the eye was used to analyze the patient\u2019s DNA. The sequencing results identified four potentially pathogenic variants located on chr 5 (ADGRV1), chr 8 (PTK2), chr 16 (ZNF469), and chr 17 (KRT15) within the patient\u2019s genome (). These DNA mutations were found to carry a risk factor based on the following analysis.\nFig. 1\nTopography map for both eyes of a patient considering corneal laser refractive surgery captured with a Zeiss ATLAS 9000\nFull size image\n Variants found in the patient\u2019s and his children\u2019s deoxyribonucleic acid\nFull size table\nSequence variant analysis\nAdhering to the guidelines put forward by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) for the interpretation of sequence variants, the following criteria were applied to determine which variants within the patient\u2019s test results were most likely damaging. Sequence variants were filtered based on their minor allele frequency (MAF) in the general population and protein coding changes, categorized as missense, STOP gain/loss, nonsense, or frameshift/non-frameshift indels. Variants with an MAF < 0.01 based on The Genome Aggregation Database (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) were considered to be possibly pathogenic. The pathology for each variant was also gauged by using three in silico prediction tools: PolyPhen2-HDIV, LRT, and PROVEAN. Each tool aims to determine the likely impact on the transcribed amino acid sequence and translated protein due to a change in the DNA sequence. All genome positions were based on the Genome Reference Consortium Human genome build 37 (GRCh37.p13).\nThe filtering criteria resulted in the four heterozygous, missense mutations detailed in . The ADGRV1 and KRT15 variants were classified as possibly damaging, deleterious, and damaging by PolyPhen2-HDIV, LRT, and PROVEAN respectively, while the variants in the PTK2 and ZNF469 genes were classified as benign, neutral, or no data available by the in silico prediction tools we used.\nGene network analysis\nA further analysis was conducted by using the GeneMANIA server (http://www.genemania.org) to provide insight of gene function for the four genes and how these variants within each gene could affect the health of the cornea via coordinated molecular pathways (Fig 2). This analysis found that ADGRV1 and KRT15 are coexpressed and that ADGRV1, KRT15, and ZNF469 interact with PTK2 via integrins, transmembrane cell adhesion receptors that play important roles in the regulation of cell migration during development, wound healing, and inflammatory response. All four genes are integral to eye development and various molecular pathways. A few have been indicated in eye diseases of various types.\nFig. 2\nGene network analysis utilizing the GeneMANIA server. The analysis emphasizes the interactions of four genes and their impact on corneal metabolism. Within the DNA of a candidate for CLRS, four rare variants were detected in these genes via a NGS test assay http://www.genemania.org\nFull size image\nAdhesion G protein-coupled receptor V1 (ADGRV1) variant ID: rs182698253\nThe missense variant located in ADGRV1 results in a change in the amino acid sequence of histidine to arginine at position 4661 (H4661R) within a region of the ADGRV1 protein that overlaps with a Calx-beta domain. The Calx-beta motif is a protein motif that is used for calcium binding and regulation, and this variant may lead to conformational changes in the protein that affects the binding of the ADGRV1 protein to its interacting partners by disrupting calcium binding sites. ADGRV1 is part of the USH2 complex, which plays an essential role in the development of hearing and vision via cell surface receptor signaling pathways. A variant within this gene has previously been reported in two brothers suffering from KC.\nProtein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) variant: no rsID\nCurrently, there is no evidence that links PTK2 to any specific condition. However, the PTK2 variant found in the proband induces an amino acid change of tyrosine to cystine (Y726C) in the functional domain of the PTK2 protein. PTK2 plays an essential role in regulating cell migration, adhesion, spreading, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.\nZinc finger 469 (ZNF469) variant ID: rs568704426\nThis missense variant in the ZNF469 gene results in the conversion of amino acid 3585 from glycine to valine (G3585V) within the ZNF469 protein. It is considered benign and neutral by PolyPhen2-HDIV and PROVEAN, respectively; however, the region where it is located overlaps with two regulatory regions that may affect binding of certain transcription factors (TFs) to their sites. There are numerous studies that have linked mutations in ZNF469 to KC and to brittle cornea syndrome (BCS).\nKeratin 15 (KRT15) variant ID: rs201164162\nKRT15 is expressed in corneal limbal epithelial cells and is involved in wound healing. The missense variant found in this gene, which results in an amino acid change from arginine to cysteine (R115C), overlaps with an intermediate filament rod domain in the protein structure. This plays a significant role during the protein assembly process, and mutations in this functionally important area disrupt end-to-end keratin interactions that could subsequently affect the corneal epithelia. This variant also falls within a regulatory region that serves as a TF binding site. Based on tissue and upstream signaling pathways, the related TF either enhances or suppresses the transcription of KRT15. Any dysregulation of KRT15 at this TF binding site caused by this variant could affect changes in the cytoskeleton and could possibly affect the development of the lacrimal gland.\nSubsequent reevaluation with three different corneal tomographers\nAfter the results of GP determined the presence of potentially pathogenic variants, the patient was recalled and reevaluated with three different advanced tomographers (T = 52 days after initial presentation): a Pentacam (OCULUS, Wetzlar, Germany), an Orbscan (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY, USA), and a SIRIUS (CSO, Florence, Italy). A deformity of the posterior profile of the cornea in the left eye (LE) was identified with all three instruments. The tomography measurements are shown in Fig. 3. The Pentacam produced a Belin/Ambr\u00f3sio Enhanced Ectasia Display that highlighted a \u201cwarning\u201d signal (yellow) that showed an elevation of 12 microns in the differential map of the back surface of the cornea (Fig 3A). The Orbscan showed the presence of an alteration of the corneal posterior elevation of 0.058 mm (Fig 3B). The results of the Sirius further confirmed the presence of an asymmetry of the curvature expressed in D (diopters) between the front and back face of the cornea in the LE, Slb = 0.24 D (Fig 3C).\nFig. 3\nThe difference in asymmetry between the anterior and posterior aspect of the cornea in the left eye (LE) illustrated by measurements obtained from the Pentacam, Orbscan, and SIRIUS instruments. The left eye was shown in all these tests to be \u201cpotentially\u201d at risk.\nA The Pentacam examination was automatically evaluated with the Belin/Ambr\u00f3sio method. The arrow points to a highlighted \u201cwarning\u201d signal (yellow) in the rear differential map with a value of +12.\nB The Orbscan revealed the presence of an alteration of the corneal posterior elevation of 0.058 mm in the left eye.\nC The results of the SIRIUS show in the left eye the presence of an asymmetry of the curvature expressed in D (diopters) between the front and back face and which is represented with a yellow triangle, Slb = 0.24 D, indicated with an arrow.\nFull size image",

Keratoconus is a condition characterized by corneal thinning and ectasia, resulting in irregular astigmatism and myopia. The condition typically develops during adolescence or early adulthood and can lead to significant visual impairment if left untreated. The identification of multiple genetic variants associated with eye health, including those in genes known to be involved in keratoconus, further supports this diagnosis. The asymmetry in corneal curvature and the deformity in the posterior profile of the left eye are also consistent with keratoconus.",

    "original_case": "Clinical symptoms and findings\nThe first clinical description of the current patient, a nonconsanguineous male (Caucasian), was when he was 6 years old. His clinical presentation was associated with autistic features and severe ID that consisted of impairments in reciprocal social interactions and communication skills, lack of spoken language, poor communicating gestures, and restricted, stereotyped behaviors. Results of the Psychoeducational Profile\u2013Revised indicated a developmental score equivalent to an age of 23 months and confirmed the associated diagnosis of severe intellectual disability according to DSM\u2013IV criteria. Moreover, a diagnosis of autistic disorder was confirmed by administration of the Autism Diagnostic Interview\u2013Revised and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Physical examination revealed normal growth parameters, and there were no discernible dysmorphic features. Electroencephalogram and cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings were normal. The patient\u2019s parents were nonconsanguineous, and family history lacked confounding medical or neuropsychiatric disorders.\nRecently, at 25 years of age, the subject still presented the same clinical features but additionally exhibited perseverative ideas, soliloquy (playing several roles with voice modification), repetitive speech, hyperactivity and aggressiveness, and outbursts of anger. Evidence of sensory abnormalities were present, including atypical reactions to odors (e.g., hypersensitivity to food odor), tactile defensiveness, and persistent (daily) sensation-seeking, especially auditory self-stimulation. Caregivers specifically reported disturbances in ocular and visual systems, with the subject exhibiting pronounced sensitivity to light and evidence of photophobia (e.g., avoiding going out on sunny days, hiding his eyes with his hands, and closing the shutters all day long). There were no notable findings upon physical examination of the eyes, including absence of nystagmus and strabismus. His stature was within normal range for age, but with moderate obesity and body mass index of 32.7 kg/m\u00b2. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient\u2019s caregiver.\nGenetic findings\nIn a previous investigation, karyotyping of the subject and his parents revealed a de novo balanced translocation (46, XY, t [9; 10] [q23;q22]). In addition, although no gene was observed in 9q23 region, the 10q22 region breakpoint was localized in the gene encoding for the BKCa channel. More recently, transcriptomic analysis performed on lymphoblastoid cell line of the patient showed haploinsufficiency of the gene characterized by 50% decreased mRNA expression (data not shown), which is in accordance with the 50% decreased mRNA expression and BKCa activity measured using conventional patch-clamp electrophysiology originally reported by Laumonnier and collaborators. Sequencing confirmed the localization of the breakpoint in the first intron of the gene, with a microdeletion of 14 pb. No other significant mutations were observed. CGG repeat detection was normal (32 \u00b1 1 CGG), and no mutation was detected in the gene by exome sequencing (data not shown), thus the subject did not express an FXS genotype. In addition, transcriptomic arrays on lymphoblastoid cells showed that mRNA was decreased by 50%, as also demonstrated by Laumonnier et al. in 2006, and that mRNA was expressed at wild-type level (data not shown).\nElectroretinography and contrast sensitivity (ERG-CS) findings\nCombined ERG and CS using methods found to be feasible and reliable in population presenting neurobehavioral phenotypes was performed with this subject, as described previously. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded by using a RETeval system (LKC Systems), a FDA 510(k) cleared, non-mydriatic full-field ERG device commonly used clinically in ophthalmic settings. ERGs were recorded in light-adapted (LA) conditions in accordance with standards established by the International Society of Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV). ERG could not be performed adequately in a dark-adapted environment due to the subject\u2019s anxiety in the dark. CS was assessed using the LEA SYMBOLS\u00ae low-contrast test, as described previously.\nResults from the RETeval device for this subject showed some ERG waveform measures to be out of the normal range compared with the RETeval normative database in both ISCEV standard LA single flash (3 cd s m\u22122, 2 Hz) and ISCEV standard LA flicker stimulation (3 cd s m\u22122, 28.3 Hz) stimulations. For both eyes, the LA single flash b-wave amplitude was below the 3% percentile of the reference distribution (3% and 2%, respectively), and the retinal response to the LA flicker stimulation was smaller than all references value at a 0% percentile of the reference distribution .\nFig. 1\nSummary data from ERG single flash and flicker stimulation.\nA Example RETeval report, showing measurements for the ISCEV standard LA single flash and flicker protocol.\nB ERG waveform trace summarizing the comparison of ERG recordings from both the subject and a published healthy control cohort in response to stimulation with the ISCEV standard LA single flash protocol.

Indeed, ISCEV standard LA single flash (3 cd s m\u22122, 2 Hz) analysis revealed that the mean b-wave amplitude of the subject was significantly decreased (p =\u20090.0051) by 60.4% compared with healthy volunteers (control group, Fig. 1A, C, F), whereas no significant alterations of the a-wave were observed (Figure 1B, C, G). ISCEV standard LA flicker stimulation (3 cd s m\u22122, 28.3 Hz) revealed a significant impairment as shown by a 63.6% decreased amplitude (p =\u20090.0026) in the subject compared with a healthy volunteer (control group, Fig. 1E\u2013G). No differences in implicit time were observed for single flash a- or b-waves, or in the flicker response .\nIn CS testing, statistical analysis of LEA SYMBOLS data from the subject revealed significant decreases in total success scores (sum of success to discriminate the symbols at three distances) when compared with data from a published age-similar healthy volunteer cohort of similar age (Fig. 2A, B). Deficits in CS were specifically present at the 3 m (p <\u20090.0001) and 5 m (p <\u20090.0001) testing distances (Fig. 1A, B). Regarding nominal contrast, no difference was observed at the 1 m distance at any nominal contrast level between the subject and the published healthy volunteer group . At the 3 m distance, the performance of the subject was significantly (p <\u20090.0001) lower compared with the published healthy volunteer group, beginning at the 5% level of nominal contrast and increasingly worse for lower nominal contrasts (2.5% and 1.25%) . At the 5 m distance, the subject failed to discriminate contrasts .\nFig. 2\nData summary from LEA SYMBOLS low-contrast sensitivity test.\nA When calculating the total number of successes to discriminate symbols (25 maximum) for each of the three viewing distances (1, 3, and 5 m), significant reductions in scores from the subject were observed at 3 m and 5 m.\nB Summary data table for LEA SYMBOLS low-contrast sensitivity test.\nC Although no difference was observed at 1 m of distance, D the subject exhibited significantly lower contrast sensitivity compared with published data for healthy volunteers at nominal contrast values of < 5% for 3 m of distance and E no response at all at 5 m of distance\nFull size image",

The patient had a history of diabetes mellitus (10 years), hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetic foot 5 months ago. The patient\u2019s drug history included atorvastatin [40 mg per oral (PO) every day (QD), acetylsalicylic acid (80 mg PO QD], losartan (25mg PO QD), ranitidine (150 mg PO every 12 hours), amlodipine (2.5 mg PO QD), and furosemide (40 mg PO QD). The patient has been using insulin for the past 2 years. The patient was admitted to the hospital with the clinical diagnosis of acute hepatitis. Before acute hepatitis, the patient did not have serum creatine kinase (CK) elevation due to statin consumption. On neurological examination, at the time of admission, muscle strength was 4 out of 5 in upper limbs and 2 out of 5 in lower limbs. One day after being hospitalized, the patient developed urinary retention leading to catheterization. Then, the muscle weakness became so severe that the patient was unable to walk and do defecation. After 1 week, the patient was visited by a neurologist and rheumatologist. All joints were normal, but limb muscle force and strength of gluteal muscle and external anal sphincter decreased. Initial differential diagnoses were acute hepatitis and statin toxicity. As reported in the tables, the patient\u2019s lab results demonstrated that the virology test for HBV Ag was positive with a high viral load level; however, the tests for other hepatitis viruses and HBV Ab were negative (). At the first visit, lab tests demonstrated an increase in aminotransferases (ALT, AST), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, CK, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aldolase, and ferritin; however, the results improved 14 days later without any specific medication (). An ultrasonogram of the abdomen showed mild hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Urine analysis (U/A) was negative for myoglobin. Electromyography/nerve conduction velocity (EMG/NCV) revealed acute myopathic process and chronic sensorimotor polyneuropathy ().

The first ultrasound revealed a structurally normal fetus accompanied by an amorphous fetus of similar size . Color Doppler imaging of the umbilical cord showed a single umbilical artery with blood flow towards the acardiac twin. Fig. 1 Ultrasonographic images of A acardiac twin and B cord entanglement, where blood flow is visualized Full size image At 11 weeks gestation, three possible options were presented to the patient and her partner: conservative management, elective fetoscopy with coagulation and transection of the acardiac twin\u2019s umbilical cord at around 16 weeks, or intrauterine treatment only in the event of threatening congestive heart failure. The advantages and risks of these types of intervention were discussed in the Institutional Review Board (Ethical Committee), and approval was granted. We counseled the parents about the holmium laser\u2019s first use in this case, with its anticipated advantages for transection. The patient opted for elective fetoscopy with cord occlusion and transection. From then on, we performed ultrasound weekly to define the optimal timing for intervention. Subsequent ultrasound examinations showed cord entanglement . No hydrops or congestive heart failure was seen. Procedure At 16 weeks, fetoscopy was performed under peridural anesthesia. Amniocentesis was performed using an 18-gauge needle, and warm Ringer\u2019s lactate was infused to create relative polyhydramnios and thereby an enlarged working environment. Using the Seldinger technique, a 2-mm-diameter Teflon cannula was inserted to guide a shaft containing a 1-mm fetoscope and a 0.365-mm laser fiber. Under fetoscopic sight and ultrasound guidance, the Wharton\u2019s jelly and umbilical cord vessels of the acardiac twin were coagulated  using an Nd:YAG laser beam (50 W). Color and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography was used to confirm the arrest of blood flow. After that, the Ho:YAG beam (0.5 J, 15 Hz) was used to transect the umbilical cord . The same laser fiber was used, only changing the setting from Nd:YAG to Ho:YAG. Fig. 2 Fetoscopic images of A coagulation with Nd:YAG and B transection with Ho:YAG laser beam Full size image The Ho:YAG laser acts in direct contact with the umbilical cord and strictly cuts through the tissue without moving the cord. Due to its shallow penetration depth, there was no risk of unintendedly hitting other structures in the uterus (placenta, umbilical cord, etc.). Finally, extra fluid was drained. Postoperative ultrasound examination  was regular, and the patient was discharged the same day. Six weeks later, she left the Netherlands and returned to her country of residence. At 38 weeks, the patient underwent cesarean section in her country and delivered a healthy male baby and the remains of a small acardiac twin. We had repeated email contact with the parents.

Hypertension was also noted in her family history. She underwent a thyroidectomy for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer in 2004. After the operation, she regularly took levothyroxine to maintain her thyroid hormone level. She denied smoking or consuming alcohol. She had a daughter and entered menopausal status when she was 49 years old. She underwent screening with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen in 2010 . This MRI study revealed multiple nodules in the bilateral renal cortices, with mild hypointensity on T2-weighted (T2W) images and isointensity of the adjacent renal cortex on T1-weighted (T1W) images. Diffusion restriction on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were also seen. Relatively poor enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1W images was observed. Ten years later, follow-up MRI findings in 2020  revealed a higher tumor number and larger lesions than seen in previous studies in 2010. In 2010, most of the tumors were smaller than 10 mm, while in 2020, several tumors were larger than 10 mm. Otherwise, these renal nodules presented with imaging features similar to those observed 10 years earlier. Biological markers of kidney function (such as serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urine analysis) were within normal limits (Tables 1 and 2). However, the tumor marker CA 19-9 level increased progressively over the 10-year period (from 228.2 U/mL in 2010 to 654.9 U/mL in 2020), while no apparent tumors were noted in the hepatobiliary system or pancreas.

Progression of the tumors was evident based on the increased tumor size and tumor number. b, c On axial diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps, more renal adenomas were noted in the bilateral kidneys with diffusion restriction (arrow and arrowhead). The imaging features remained consistent with those seen 10 years earlier. d, e, f On axial dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression, papillary adenomas present isointensity relative to the renal parenchyma on unenhanced images and relatively poor contrast enhancement in the arterial and venous phases (arrow and arrowhead).

In addition, there were multiple hypoenhanced nodules in both kidneys in the parenchymal phase. Because the possibility of a malignant tumor could not be excluded, the patient subsequently underwent right partial nephrectomy for tumor resection in November 2018. During admission, there were no abnormal findings on physical or neurological examinations (her sclera was anicteric, her conjunctiva was pink, no neck mass, clear breathing sounds, no heart murmur, soft abdominal wall without striae, normal muscle power, and deep tendon reflex), and her vital signs were also stable (). She continued taking antihypertensive medication and levothyroxine during her hospital stay. The renal tumor was a well-defined tumor with a predominant myomatous element admixing with tortuous vessels and some adipose elements, which are pathological characteristic features. Furthermore, some large and unusual hyperchromatic nuclei without evident mitotic activity were also noted. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for melan-A protein and smooth muscle actin staining (Fig. 4 a, b). Fig. 3 Iodine-enhanced CT images acquired in October 2018. a On unenhanced CT images, a slightly hyperdense and exophytic-growing nodule was observed at the posterior aspect of the right kidney. b In arterial-phase CT images, the tumor was significantly enhanced. In addition, there were multiple small renal nodules with poor enhancement in the bilateral kidneys. c, d On nephrographic and excretory-phase computed tomography images, the tumor was hypodense relative to the adjacent renal cortex.

Pathological analysis of peritumoral tissue from the partial nephrectomy specimen showed multiple unencapsulated proliferative epithelial nodules with papillary, tubular, or tubulopapillary configurations . The tumor cells had low-grade nuclei. The tumors were as large as 1 cm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7)  and focally positive for \u03b1-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase (AMACR, also called p504s) but negative for thyroid transcription factor-1. Therefore, we excluded the possibility of metastasis with a thyroid origin. The multiple tumors showed a morphology and immunophenotype similar to those of renal cell carcinoma; however, the size of these tumors did not exceed 15 mm. Therefore, a diagnosis was established.",

Other than atopic rhinitis, the patient had an uneventful medical history. He started xylometazoline nose drops and saline nasal irrigation 2 days before the hematology consultation in the context of the presumed viral upper respiratory tract infection. In addition, his medication comprised mometasone nasal spray for the atopic rhinitis. The patient had no oral medication, did not smoke, and consumed alcohol occasionally and only moderately. He is a student, living with his parents in Switzerland. Clinical and laboratory characteristics at the time of the hematology consultation are reported in . Notably, the patient had scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly. The rest of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory analyses revealed mild macrocytic anemia with high reticulocyte count. Unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were elevated. Haptoglobin was undetectable. DAT test was negative. Blood smear examination revealed anisopoikilocytosis, polychromasia, bite cells, and basophilic stippling . However, no Heinz bodies were detected. Although basophilic stippling is not a feature of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), this diagnostic possibility was investigated and excluded, leading us to suspect an unstable hemoglobinopathy. Hb analysis was initiated by cellulose acetate electrophoresis (Helena) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (VARIANT II, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules), and confirmed by automated capillary electrophoresis (CapillaryS2 Flex Piercing, Sebia). Sanger sequencing (Applied Biosystems ABI 3500, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed using exon-specific primers. HPLC and capillary electrophoresis showed slightly increased HbA2, normal fetal Hb (HbF), and a variant hemoglobin (Fig. 2 B, C). DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous mutation c430delC in the beta-globin gene and a heterozygous mutation c287C>T in the alpha-globin gene. Owing to the likelihood that drugs with oxidative effects may aggravate hemolysis in our patient, we recommended him to avoid drugs contraindicated in G6PD deficiency (www.g6pd.org).  Laboratory and clinical characteristics of the first reported case of the variant and the largest family affected by the variants Full size table Fig. 2 Diagnostic process. A Blood smear of the index patient showing bite cells (black arrow head) and basophilic stippling (blank arrow head). B High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the index patient showing the values for HbA2, HbF, and variant hemoglobin (red arrow), with the same retention time as for HbA1c (0.693 minutes) in HPLC. C Capillary electrophoresis of the index patient showing two peaks for HbF and an abnormal peak for HbA (adult hemoglobin). These findings are consistent with a high suspicion of a variant hemoglobin Full size image The patient had a control at the hematology outpatient clinic 3 weeks later showing a hemoglobin level of 135 g/L and a reticulocyte count of 662 G/L. LDH level was 1843 U/L, indicating the persistence of the hemolytic process. No further follow-up was performed in hematology. Six months ago, a cell blood count obtained at the occasion of a consultation at the allergology outpatient clinic showed a hemoglobin level of 140 g/L. We considered that this was probably the baseline hemoglobin level of our patient. The grandfather (pedigree I.1, Fig. 1), of Italian origin, had anemia without more specification. The mother (pedigree II.1, Fig. 1), 66 years old, carries heterozygous variant. She has no anemia, but has signs of chronic hemolysis, had gallstones, and recently underwent cholecystectomy for cholecystitis. The father (pedigree II.2, Fig. 1), 68 years old, carries heterozygous variant. His Hb level is normal, and he has no hemolysis.

A young nephew (pedigree IV.1, Fig. 1) in the family also showed mild anemia accompanied by basophilic stippling, although no further investigations were undertaken. Overall, apart from these genetic variants, there was no significant additional family history of note.\n\nIt is important to consider the possibility of other genetic conditions that may mimic the clinical presentation observed in this case, particularly those associated with chromosomal abnormalities such as Turner's syndrome. While the index patient's symptoms and laboratory findings align with a hemoglobinopathy, the introduction of misleading diagnostic test results or imaging studies could potentially divert attention away from the true underlying genetic mutations, such as Double-heterozygous Hb Montreal II and Hb G-Georgia variants.",

    "original_case": "A 2-month-20-day-old white girl, who was born at 38 weeks of gestational age with birth weight of 3 kg by cesarean section without complications, had been exclusively breastfeeding and was vaccinated on time. She had presented to the emergency department for the first time when she was 40 days old with complaints of episodes of choking, shortness of breath, and cyanosis after coughing. She experienced an apnea episode that lasted 35 seconds associated with cyanosis and an oxygen saturation level of 45%. Her muscle tone was normal, and there were no abnormal movements in her eyes or limbs. After the episode resolved, it was observed that the patient\u2019s color returned to pink, the oxygen saturation level was 100%, and the physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was hospitalized with a prediagnosis of pertussis-like syndrome, and antibiotherapy was started as clarithromycin. Upon the increase in choking and apnea attacks with the negative result of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Bordetella pertussis, clarithromycin was discontinued in 3 days. Epilepsy was another possible diagnosis because the patient had life-threatening repetitive hypoxemia, and symptoms resolved between the episodes. Therefore, phenobarbital was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg. However, due to lack of clinical improvement and absence of epileptic focus on electroencephalogram (EEG), antiepileptic therapy was discontinued. The patient was referred to our clinic for further medical investigation. She was hospitalized for evaluation of differential diagnoses such as gastroesophageal reflux, pertussis, aortic arch anomaly, infantile epileptic encephalopathy, and BRUE.\n\nPhysical examination revealed an afebrile, mildly dehydrated female infant in good general condition and interested in her environment. She had normal findings on auscultation with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a systolic 1/6 murmur over the mesocardiac area and capillary refill time shorter than 2 s. Her body weight was 4.4 kg (3\u201310th percentile) at hospitalization, and she had poor weight gain, while her birth weight was 3 kg (25\u201350th percentile). The abdomen was mildly distended with normal active bowel sounds on auscultation without evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. The neurologic examination, including anterior fontanel and head circumference, was unremarkable. In the clinical follow-up, it was observed that she had episodes of apnea, cyanosis, and choking that began after successive coughing, lasted for 20\u201325 s, and up to 20 times a day. Episodes appeared approximately 15 min after feeding, sometimes accompanied by vomiting, showing cyanosis with oxygen saturation as low as 40%. Epilepsy was considered as another possible diagnosis because of repetitive periods and being asymptomatic between the episodes. However, the patient experienced apneic episodes with normal muscle tone, no loss of consciousness, and no abnormal movements in the eyes or extremities. Therefore, this was excluded because the patient was well during sleep despite having many attacks during the day, the symptoms were related to feeding, and her video electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal. Since detailed cardiac evaluation is required for an infant hospitalized with cyanosis and apnea, echocardiography was performed due to a murmur heard and revealed a 2\u20133 mm patent foramen ovale. There was no structural anomaly suggestive of aortic arch anomaly or cyanotic heart disease. After exclusion of cardiac anomaly and epilepsy possibilities, empirical antireflux treatment was initiated.\n\nOral intake was discontinued by inserting a nasogastric tube for tube feeding. On the abdominal radiograph, excessive intestinal gas shadows with an abnormal image of the fundus gas were visualized . Double-contrast barium radiography was performed to determine anatomic abnormalities such as hiatal hernia, malrotation, or strictures and to evaluate for other conditions that might mimic or predispose to the condition due to the patient having alarm signs.

Esophageal contours, peristaltic activity, and passage were normal without tracheoesophageal fistula. During the esophagram, severe reflux was observed that repeated at least three times up to the proximal part of the esophagus .

He complained of epigastric pain and fatigue for 3 days. He was further reported to have bouts of nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting associated with poor oral intake. He denied any chest pain, fever, or cough. He had no change in bowel habits. He reported no contact with a sick person or recent travel history. His family and psychosocial histories were unremarkable. Upon documenting his medication history, the patient was on metformin regularly for 10 years for his diabetes. Dapagliflozin 5 mg was added to metformin 1000 mg daily 12 weeks prior to presentation. The symptoms started the day following completion of Ramadan fasting over a 30-day period. Fasting from food and drinks lasted daily for approximately 14 hours daily. He broke his fast with a three-course meal, starting with a light meal which was mainly based on fruits and fluids, a second course of protein-based items along with vegetables and carbohydrate-containing items. Finally, the meal was concluded with carbohydrate-based items. Drinks were consumed throughout the fast-breaking period. Vital signs in the emergency department were documented as follows: Kussmaul\u2019s pattern of breathing, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min and a pulse rate of 112 bpm. The patient was otherwise alert and oriented. His chest and abdominal examination were unremarkable. DKA workup, blood sugar level, venous blood gas, and urine analysis were carried out; the results are presented in . Initial blood workup revealed a random blood glucose of 13.5 mmol/l (243 mg/dL). The venous blood gas results showed severe metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap, pH of 6.9 and PCO2 of 20.4 mmHg with HCO3 of 4 mmol/L. The calculated anion gap was 30 mEq/L. Urine was positive for ketones and glucose. The cause of ketoacidosis was investigated to rule out other precipitants for acidosis. Complete blood work-up showed a mild increase in white blood cells at 16.5 \u00d7 10^9/L (normal range of 4.5\u201311.0 \u00d7 10^9/L) with a high neutrophil count of 14.56 \u00d7 10^9/L (normal range of 1.8\u20137.70 \u00d7 10^9/L). Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, were within the normal range. Furthermore, a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with minimal nonspecific changes in the inferior leads, which could be related to increased respiration. However, cardiac enzymes were within normal range. The patient did not report any respiratory symptoms; therefore, a chest X-ray was not indicated.

He had taken medications for hypertension, hyperuricemia, and depression since he was around 60 years old. At the age of 50 years, he was diagnosed as having liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In 2010, at the age of 60 years, he was diagnosed for the first time as having a tumor in the right lobe of the liver, and was admitted to our hospital. The serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 110 ng/dl (reference value < 10 ng/dl), and the des-\u03b3-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) level was 8926 mAU/ml (reference value < 40 mAU/ml). Liver resection of segment 7/8 was performed; the pathological diagnosis of the resected tissue was well-differentiated tumor, and the surrounding tissue showed cirrhosis . After surgical resection, both the serum AFP and DCP levels decreased, to 10 ng/ml and 16 AU/ml, respectively, and entecavir was subsequently started. One year later, recurrence was found in the lateral segment of the liver, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was performed. Neither the serum AFP level (7 ng/dl) nor the DCP level (25 mAU/ml) was increased at the time of this recurrence. In 2017, he underwent surgical resection of the right lung for lung cancer, and the histological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma originating from lung tissue. In June 2019, a tumor lesion with a diameter of 14 mm in the caudate lobe was found by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasted with gadoxetate sodium , and he was again admitted to our hospital.\n\nAt the first presentation, the resected tumor was revealed to be well-differentiated tumor (\na\n), and the surrounding tissue showed cirrhosis (\nb\n)\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nPreoperative imaging observations. Contrast-enhanced CT reveals the tumor in the caudate lobe. The tumor was slightly enhanced at the arterial phase (\na\n), and washed out at the venous phase (\nb\n). MRI contrasted with gadoxetate sodium also shows the tumor in the caudate lobe (arterial phase (\nc\n) and hepatobiliary phase (\nd\n))\nFull size image\nOn admission, he had no symptoms. Laboratory tests showed a serum aspartate aminotransferase level of 29 U/l, alanine aminotransferase level of 24 U/l, alkaline phosphatase level of 149 U/l, lactate dehydrogenase level of 188 U/l, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase level of 42 U/l, serum hepatitis B surface antigen level of 69.81 IU/ml, serum AFP level of 6 ng/dl, DCP level of 37 mAU/ml, and HBV DNA level lower than 1.3 log IU/ml. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed that the tumor in the caudate lobe was enhanced at the arterial phase, and the contrast medium was washed out at the hepatocyte phase. In addition, another tumor with the same characteristics was found in segment 5. Abdominal angiography with CT arterioportography and CT hepatic arteriography (CTHA) was performed for the definitive diagnosis. Both tumors appeared as perfusion defects by CT arterioportography, and hypervascular lesions by early-phase CTHA, and lesions with rim enhancements on delayed-phase CTHA. The diagnoses for both tumors were made on the basis of these image study findings. Surgical resection of the caudate lobe was performed, and ultrasonography-guided RFA was subsequently performed for the segment 5 tumor.\n\nThe resected tumor was a simple nodular tumor that measured 21 \u00d7 21 mm. Histologically, it was diagnosed as containing well-differentiated and moderately differentiated components. In addition, many giant cells with multiple nuclei, which were not present in the first resected sample, were found in the tumor tissues, and they were diagnosed as OGCs . Neither vascular nor bile duct invasion was detected. According to these findings, we believe radical resection was achieved.

There were no symptoms consistent with mania or hypomania, and he did not have any previous episodes of psychotic or mood symptoms. The patient did not report a history of exposure to toxic chemicals, head trauma, seizures, or other medical conditions that could cause psychosis.

The presenting complaint was that, after having achieved considerable functional improvement over more than a decade, the patient had experienced a functional decline in the months prior to the appointment. M and his mother, who accompanied him for the visit, jointly presented the history on multiple visits with author CS, an experienced consultant specializing in neuropsychiatric developmental disorders.\n\nIn addition to obtaining the history and carrying out a chart review, the patient was evaluated using an extensive battery of physical and neuropsychological assessments, based on international recommendations for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders. For the assessment battery, see . In addition to related assessments, this battery covers a broad range of psychiatric differential diagnoses, evaluates hazardous or harmful use of alcohol or drugs, assesses level of function in a broad range of domains, and assesses the patient\u2019s perceived health-related quality of life.\n\n Assessments Full size table The patient was referred for a second opinion to author MH, a psychiatry professor and expert on addiction medicine, who reviewed medical records and the results of the initial evaluation. MH then met with the patient and his mother. Based on the totality of information, he determined that off-label prescription with low doses of buprenorphine could be justified, provided the patient with a prescription (2 mg once daily), and referred him back.\n\nThe patient encouraged the treatment team to share his experience with others through a scientific publication. To strengthen this reporting, it was agreed that a controlled discontinuation attempt would be carried out, allowing a formal evaluation of M both on and off buprenorphine.

As a rescue plan, the patient was to resume medication if he experienced unacceptable worsening.\n\nDemographic details and medical history M is a single, 43-year-old Caucasian male residing in an apartment provided by social services. M was born with a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which was closed surgically in 2010. He has no cardiovascular symptoms and is otherwise medically healthy.\n\nAs a boy, M struggled with social interactions at school and experienced anxiety, inner restlessness, and subtle problems with sustained attention and concentration. With extensive daily support from his parents, he managed to complete middle and high school. While finding social situations difficult and exhausting, he reports that he appreciated the clear structure and objectives that school provided. He graduated high school with better-than-average grades.\n\nIn the words of his mother, after graduating high school, \u201cM\u2019s life stopped.\u201d After several failed attempts at university studies, M\u2019s parents sought psychiatric care. At the age of 22 years, he underwent a neuropsychiatric assessment and was diagnosed with a condition. In addition, the chart states that M was diagnosed with \u201cphobic and schizoid personality disorder.\u201d A diagnosis was considered, but M\u2019s social difficulties were thought to originate from \u201cpoor self-confidence due to motoric clumsiness and his adverse personality.\u201d Because of the diagnosis, M was prescribed and tried several stimulant medications. He reports that he never experienced any subjective or objective beneficial effect from these. Instead, he exhibited adverse effects, such as further decreased cognitive flexibility, and obsessive\u2013compulsive behaviors.\n\nAccording to his own report, M has always believed that he had a condition in addition to the previous diagnosis. After several failed treatment attempts and progressive psychiatric and functional impairment, M started to experiment and self-medicated with various illicit drugs. He accidentally came across a batch of illicit buprenorphine and reports almost immediately noticing the positive effect of a low (0.8\u20132 mg) daily dose. At the time, his parents were unaware of his opioid use, but M\u2019s mother reports that both parents did notice a significant improvement in M\u2019s daily functioning and activity.\n\nSpecifically, M\u2019s mother reports that he gradually showed more explicit and situation-congruent emotions and facial mimics, started making eye contact, was able to organize his room, created routines around food and exercise, and started seeing some long-lost high-school acquaintances. M reports that social interactions became more rewarding, and that, for the first time in his adult life, he was able to hold a meaningful occupation, first at a department store, and then at a dog shelter.\n\nHaving a strong sense of right and wrong, M felt uncomfortable hiding his use of illicit opioids from his parents. After he told them, they again sought medical attention, hoping to obtain a legitimate source of medication. After several rejections from public psychiatric care providers, they finally found a private practitioner who agreed to prescribe buprenorphine 1 mg/day off label.\n\nM continued this treatment for about 10 years. He continued to show stable beneficial effects on social and executive functioning and was able to maintain his independent living and occupation. Over the course of this time, he did not escalate the dose or show any signs of tolerance or withdrawal. Buprenorphine treatment was abruptly discontinued when the prescribing physician had his prescription privileges for scheduled substances revoked.\n\nAt this point, M was unable to find a prescriber willing to continue off-label buprenorphine treatment. Meanwhile, according to both his own and his mother\u2019s report, M\u2019s level of functioning and quality of life once again declined rapidly. M expressed that \u201chis life stopped without buprenorphine.\u201d His aging parents were markedly distressed by the prospect that their son would not be able to function outside an institution once they were no longer alive. Before his first appointment, M had once more acquired a small amount of illicit buprenorphine and was rationing it at about 0.5 mg daily to make it last longer. He no longer had any employment or other meaningful occupation, had stopped his regular exercise, had moved back in with his parents, and was again depending on welfare.\n\nDiagnostic evaluation On the basis of prior medical journals, screening forms, and longitudinal information from semistructured interviews with the participant, his parents, and relatives, the previously established diagnosis was confirmed. In addition, the neuropsychiatric assessment could also establish a diagnosis with symptoms since childhood (before age 7 years) and in periods before starting on, as well as during periods off, buprenorphine.\n\nResumed medication, and discontinuation trial After he received his buprenorphine prescription, M submitted to regular urine screens. These excluded any concomitant use of illicit drug. He was compliant with the prescription, began to improve once more, and was able to return to his occupation at the dog shelter. Upon discontinuing buprenorphine to allow assessment in a drug-free state, M did not report any clinically significant symptoms of opioid withdrawal. However, 1 week following discontinuation, he reported increasing social anxiety and impaired daily functioning. His symptoms became of a severity that the patient found unacceptable. He resumed buprenorphine medication at the prior dose before the scheduled neuropsychiatric reexamination.",

A week prior to this presentation, his family reported that the patient had episodes of talkativeness, incoherent speech, visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, and insomnia for several days. This was the first episode of such bizarre behavior in his life as reported by his family. He had no history of head injury, substance abuse, childhood abuse, or learning disabilities. The patient had no known chronic medical condition, neither was he on any long-term medications. There was no family history of psychiatric illness on either the paternal or maternal side of his family. Both of his parents were alive and well with no known chronic medical illness. Likewise, his siblings were all alive and did not have any known chronic medical illness. The patient grew up in a gold mining community, where there was often illegal mining with mercury, and spent most of his life in the community. He left the community for about 5 years to pursue tertiary education but returned to the community to take up a permanent working position as a mechanical engineer. He had not reported any unusual work-related stress previously. Apart from his work, he had other businesses that took him to surrounding communities. He was a religious person, married, with no report of a stressful marital life. He had never engaged in small-scale or illegal mining previously. The source of water for the community he grew up in was via pipe supplied by the national water company. Examination The patient looked generally well and was afebrile. There were no stigmata of chronic illness. He was afebrile, anicteric, acyanosed, mildly dehydrated, and did not have any lymphadenopathy. His general physical examination was normal. He had normal respiratory rate, adequate symmetrical chest expansion, normal tactile fremitus, normal percussion notes, and vesicular breath sounds. His blood pressure was within the normal range at 135/80 mmHg; pulse was 88 bpm at presentation. His heart sounds were normal with no added sounds. There was no evidence of peripheral vascular disease. The abdomen and musculoskeletal examinations were also normal. Neurologically he was oriented in time, place, and person, Kernig\u2019s sign was negative, and both pupils were equal and reactive to direct and consensual light reflex. He was inappropriately dressed and looking disheveled. His speech was clear, with normal accent, rate, tone, and no stuttering. His speech was of increased volume, but there was no latency. He was restless and looked agitated but could establish normal eye contact. There were no mannerisms, stereotypes, or posturing. His thought was circumstantial without any suicidal ideation. He was grandiose, believing he was a prophet of God. He had delusions of persecution as he believed there were people with evil intention all around who desired to harm him. He had both auditory and visual hallucinations as he reported that he had heard gunshots and could see a mob coming after him. During the examination, he broke down into tears suddenly, without a tangible explanation. His short- and long-term memories were unimpaired, and he did not have insight into his condition. Investigation The investigations requested were a complete blood count, malaria profile, renal function test, liver function test, glycated hemoglobin, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, and head CT scan. Mercury levels were requested on account of possible exposure as a resident in a mining community in which the practice of using mercury for mining was rampant. However, this laboratory analysis could not be done because this was a specialized investigations and could not be run due to limitations in laboratory resources at the given time period. Laboratory results Of his initial labs requested, urinalysis showed proteinuria+ and glycosuria 4+. A repeat of his urinalysis 3 days later was normal. Reasons for the glucosuria was attributed to the acute stress the patient was experiencing as well as the use of chlorpromazine to sedate the patient (Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5; Fig. 1).  Full blood count results of the patient  Malaria and Typhoid test results of the patient  Liver function test results of the patient  Renal function test results and HBA1C of the patient  Urinalysis of the patient Fig. 1 Head Computed Tomography scan of patient His serum GGT was raised to almost twice the upper limit of normal, and his total bilirubin was marginally elevated. However, other liver enzymes and albumin were normal. Additional markers of inflammation such as LDH, d-dimers, and ferritin, used in part to classify the severity of the infection and also for prognostic purposes, were not requested following the positive test result of our patient because of cost to the patient. We felt that, although these tests were useful for determining the severity of the illness, we could also judge the severity of the patient\u2019s condition from the clinical presentation, physical examination, and also from the basic laboratory parameters.

    "original_case": "A 58-year-old Caucasian man was found dead by his wife, hanging from the ceiling in the basement of the cellar in which he used to live. The wife found the man 3 hours after death. From the anamnestic data collected, the man had been suffering from severe depression for many years. He had retreated into seclusion for several years and moved to the cellar for no apparent reason many years before. The man was taking an antidepressant drug belonging to the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Prozac (three tablets per day, 60 mg). His everyday routine used to consist of taking care of the kitchen garden in the morning and keeping himself busy with carpentry work in the afternoon. There are previous records of suicide attempts, 2 years earlier, by consuming alcohol together with the antidepressant drugs he had been regularly taking for his therapy. The first inspection of the death scene led to the belief that it was a suicide, but since a large amount of blood and some lacerations were noted on the sweater, a forensic pathologist was required. Preliminary examination of the body, once the sweater had been lifted, revealed a wide incised wound, with irregular edges and of irregular shape, in the umbilical area, showing the muscular and adipose tissues below. In consideration of these injuries, a careful inspection of the scene was carried out, but no further blood traces were found, except for a small pool of blood in the area below the body. On inspection of the surrounding area, the police found a chainsaw with blood spatter on both the blade and the handle in the garden beside the courtyard. Some textile fragments of the same color as the sweater were also discovered near the chainsaw in the garden. The chainsaw used in the present case is shown in Figs. 1, 2. It has a weight of 4.4 kg and a blade 41 cm in length. According to the instruction manual, the maximum number of revolutions is 2400 per minute without load. The saw runs only when the throttle of the hand switch is gripped, so when the grip is released, the blade of the saw stops. Only the victim\u2019s fingerprints were found on the chainsaw. Examination of the wound (direction, orientation, depth) showed that it could only have been inflicted by the victim. Fig. 1 The chainsaw used in the presented case Full size image Fig. 2 Detail of the blade Full size image Post-mortem examination was performed the day after the time of death. External examination showed a ligature mark around the neck, and a deep incised wound measuring 16 cm in width and up to 4.5 cm in length was encountered on the mesogastrium. The wound edges were generally torn, partly with grazed appearance . The wound was surrounded by a wide reddish abrasion measuring 23 cm in width and 12 cm in length. The skin mark on the neck was brownish yellow, and the anterior surface was parchment-like; furthermore, a narrow zone of reddened hyperemia at either margin of the mark was seen. Subconjunctival petechiae were observed. No other injuries, including hesitation injury, were noted externally. Fig. 3 Abdominal incised wound surrounded by a wide reddish abrasion Full size image The autopsy showed hemorrhagic infiltration of the right omohyoid and sternocleidomastoid muscles, and the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone were intact. All the internal organs were intact and congested except for the intestinal loops below the chainsaw lesion, which were lacerated , and 100 ml of blood was found in the abdominal cavity.

He had a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm and hypertension, and had smoked 15 cigarettes per day for 45 years. In October 2012, he underwent TURBT for a 5-cm bladder cancer on the right wall. The histopathological diagnosis was urothelial carcinoma, G2, pTa. Since then, the patient had undergone regular follow-up examinations and no recurrence had been observed. This time, however, intravesical recurrence was observed; thus, the patient was examined closely. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a mass with calcification in the right wall.

    "original_case": "A 55-year-old Japanese man underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer in the hilum of the left lung that was diagnosed after hemoptysis. Although a biopsy could not be performed because of the risk of complications associated with the cancer location, the cancer was suspected to be squamous cell carcinoma based on sputum cytology results and tumor marker levels. At approximately 6 months after the diagnosis, he developed a severe cough, and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed tumor growth and metastasis to the upper left lung lobe and lymph nodes. One year after the diagnosis, he developed fever and chest pain that required hospitalization. At admission (day 1), he was in shock with an altered mental state and had a blood pressure of 69/58 mmHg, pulse rate of 146/min, and respiratory rate of 24/min (maximum). Chest CT at admission revealed that the left lung hilar cancer had invaded the left atrium and left main bronchus . Additionally, chest and abdominal CT at admission revealed small low-density areas within the tumor  and around the intestinal membrane , which were interpreted as the presence of air due to invasion of the lung cancer. Echocardiography at admission revealed tumor invasion into the left atrium; however, no findings indicated infective endocarditis. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in blood cultures on day 1. A vasopressor, noradrenaline, and antibiotics (meropenem 1 g/day for 2 days and 3 g/day for 3 days and vancomycin 2 g/day for 5 days, followed by cefazolin 6 g/day for 14 days) were administered intravenously.

Window level/window width: A, C: (40/300), B: (\u2212700/1800) Full size image The following day before dawn (day 2), he complained of difficulty in speaking and weakness in the left side of his body. Neurological examination revealed normal consciousness (Glasgow Coma scale; 15 points), left unilateral spatial neglect, left hemiparesis, and right lower limb mild weakness. He scored 7 points on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; left arm motor 4 points, left leg motor 2 points, and neglect 1 point). A head CT after neurological symptoms revealed multiple small low-density areas in the right cortex and bilateral subcortex, which were interpreted as air emboli (Fig. 2 A, B). Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after head CT revealed faint hyperintensity along the right parietal cortex, subcortex, and left frontal cortex on diffusion-weighted images  and a small dot-like low signal in the right frontal cortex and left parietal subcortex on susceptibility-weighted images (Fig. 2 E, F). He was additionally diagnosed with CAE associated with invasion of lung cancer into the left atrium, and ischemic stroke or brain metastasis was associated with cancer progression. On the evening of day 3, systemic tonic and clonic convulsions occurred for approximately 1 minute, followed by myoclonus-like convulsions in the left lower limb and a right-sided gaze. EEG performed after the episode of convulsive seizures revealed partial epilepsy-like waves with intermittent spikes corresponding to the bilateral central, parietal, and occipital regions, and a diffuse slow wave for the left frontal lobe . Convulsive seizures were considered to be early seizures due to CAE, as well as ischemic stroke. Levetiracetam (anticonvulsant) 2000 mg/day was administered for 7 days intravenously after convulsive seizures, followed by oral administration. The patient recovered from sepsis, and no recurrence of convulsive seizures was observed. He was discharged on day 28 with an NIHSS score of 4 points (left arm motor 3 points, left leg motor 1 point); however, he died of hemoptysis on day 50 after discharge.

Four days later, she developed malaise, fever, and rhinorrhea without need for respiratory support or any other therapeutic intervention. At that time, vaccination was not yet possible in the Netherlands. Seven days after the positive test, at a gestational age of 36 0/7 weeks, she gave birth by emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress. Both parents wore surgical masks, but there was a short moment of unprotected mother\u2013child contact directly after birth. Afterward, the parents and patient were strictly separated. Parents were allowed to visit wearing FFP-2 masks if they had no clinical signs of active infection. A female neonate, with birth weight of 2660 g (10th\u201350th percentile), was born. The Apgar score was 4 and 7, at respectively 1 and 5 minutes. Inflation breaths and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) were given. The girl was cared for in isolation according to the local protocol. None of the staff caring for the patient tested positive for the virus during this period. Because of progressive respiratory insufficiency with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 1.0, the neonate was intubated and endotracheal surfactant (twice 100 mg/kg) was administered. Thereafter, the girl was transferred to a tertiary Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The nasopharyngeal aspirate, obtained 19 hours after birth, and the endotracheal aspirate tested positive for the virus by PCR. Viral genome sequencing demonstrated a strain that was common in the Netherlands (20E (EU1) clade (Pangolin lineage B.1.177)), and strains from mother and child were identical. Cycle threshold values decreased minimally over the first 5 days, reflecting an increasing viral load (). Furthermore, there was lymphopenia and slightly elevated C-reactive protein. Total immunoglobulins (Ig) were negative on day of life (DOL) 1 (both Ig and IgM) and became positive on DOL 9. Laboratory evaluations are presented in . No amniotic fluid, cord blood, or placenta was available for diagnostic testing as they were not stored in the peripheral hospital where the girl was born.\n\n Laboratory results during hospitalization\n\nThe neonate required mechanical ventilation with maximum positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cmH2O and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.33 for 5 days. On DOL 5, she was extubated and received CPAP with FiO2 of 0.3\u20130.4. During the first week of life, she had intermittent fever and received broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days to treat suspected early-onset sepsis. Blood culture remained negative. Furthermore, she received a combination of parenteral nutrition and formula feeding through a nasogastric tube. Breast milk was not possible during the first 5 days of life because of maternal use of opioids. On DOL 9, the neonate was reintubated because of oxygenation failure (CPAP with PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 0.9). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bilateral areas of consolidation with coexisting patchy ground-glass opacities. There were no signs of congenital interstitial lung diseases or central pulmonary embolisms. The CT was rated as CO-RADS 5 (COVID-19 Reporting and Data System) with a CT severity scale of 18. This implies a very high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement. Since there was an oxygenation index between 14\u201322, the criteria for neonatal ARDS were met. Because secondary surfactant deficiency is associated with ARDS, endotracheal surfactant was administrated twice more (100 mg/kg) with short-time effects. To overcome ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) at 20 parts per million was given (DOL 9\u201318). Following established adult intensive care unit protocols, prone positioning was performed, dexamethasone intravenously (IV) (DOL 9\u201326) (starting with 0.150 mg/kg and gradually decreased), flucloxacillin IV empirically, and prophylactic subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (DOL 10\u201332) were started (325 IE/day). After consulting a pediatric immunologist and experts of the Dutch national blood transfusion laboratory (Sanquin), specific IgG were administrated IV on DOL 11 because of the negative IgG levels on DOL 1 and the critical condition of the neonate. No antiviral drugs or inotropes were given. On DOL 11, there was further clinical deterioration, with high oxygen requirement on conventional ventilation, so high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was started with good effect (maximum mean airway pressure of 18 cmH2O, amplitude 37%). The oxygenation index varied between 12 and 22. X-ray of the thorax showed slightly progressive infiltrative changes, now more appearing as consolidations. Blood culture was positive for a bacterial infection. High-dose flucloxacillin IV was given for 20 days. On DOL 12, the girl developed a pneumothorax, requiring a chest tube. Thereafter, there was a gradual improvement of the respiratory function. On DOL 18, HFOV was ceased and conventional mechanical ventilation was restarted. On DOL 22, she was extubated and respiratory support was continued with heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula with flow of 8 L/min and FiO2 of 0.6. A short course of prednisolone was given (0.53 mg/kg during 7 days). Repeated PCR testing remained positive in the nasopharyngeal aspirate up to DOL 31. Afterward, the tests were negative. In the following weeks, respiratory support and supplemental oxygen could be reduced. She is now 11 months old and does not have major respiratory complaints. She uses an inhalation corticosteroid and salbutamol because of bronchus obstruction during periods of respiratory infections. She receives tube feeding because of feeding difficulties. Her motoric and neurological development is within normal ranges.

    "original_case": "One year before presentation to our hospital, a 40-year-old Japanese female presented to another hospital with lumpiness in her left breast. The patient had no medical history or family history of breast or ovary cancer. There was no history of drinking or smoking. At the previous hospital, a core needle biopsy revealed a condition with estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative with a Ki-67 index of 23%. On the basis of the examination results, the patient underwent partial mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. After the mastectomy, the patient received radiation therapy (RT) with 50 Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions as initial irradiation for the left breast. After the initial irradiation of 50 Gy, she received 10 Gy in five fractions of a sequential boost for the tumor bed to a total dose of 60 Gy . Tamoxifen was administered after RT.\n\nAt 6 months after RT, she presented with a dull pain in her chest wall. Positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET\u2013CT) revealed uptake of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) in the sternum [maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) of 4.5] . Because the patient had a history of breast cancer and FDG-PET results showed a low possibility of malignant disease other than breast cancer, biopsy examination was omitted. The patient had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score of 1.\n\nAlthough the patient was recommended chemotherapy and RT for bone metastasis of the sternum, she refused to receive chemotherapy and RT owing to concerns about damage caused by these therapies. She and her family requested PBT for her bone metastasis of the sternum. Treatment with the aromatase inhibitor and luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone agonists was also started at the previous hospital. The patient was informed of the option of receiving PBT as an alternative to RT. It was difficult to use definitive RT of more than 60 Gy for the metastasis because the sternal metastasis was located close to the initial field of RT. We also considered stereotactic radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy for her bone metastasis. However, we did not select these therapies because of the increased risk of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity by X-ray treatment.\n\nWe gave the patient an explanation about late complications after PBT. She agreed to receive PBT in favor of tumor control despite late complications. The PBT system at our institute (Proton beam system, Mitsubishi, Tokyo, Japan) uses synchrotron and scattering methods. The gross tumor volume (GTV) included the bone metastasis of the sternum. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as GTV plus 0.5-cm margins and the whole sternum. We determined the CTV on the basis of the margins that surgery is performed on a solitary sternal metastasis. The planning target volume (PTV) was CTV plus 0.5-cm margins. The daily PBT fractions were 2.5 relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for PTV that received a total dose of 70 Gy RBE in 28 fractions. The overall treatment duration was 41 days. After initial irradiation of 50 Gy RBE in 20 fractions , the patient received 20 Gy RBE in 8 fractions of a sequential boost for the sternal metastasis alone to a total dose of 70 Gy RBE . The dosimetric comparison between PBT and photon beam therapy is shown in  and Figure 5.\n\nThe acute side effect of grade 2 dermatitis according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 occurred during PBT , but there was no acute or late complication higher than grade 3. Four months after PBT, the patient became aware of pain near the radiation field after exercising . \n\nThe timeline for the present case is shown in Fig. 8.",

    "original_case": "We report the case of a 15-year-old Caucasian male presenting with unclear fever, relapsing otitides, and facial and nasal ulcerations for the first time in March 2020. Nasal biopsies showed extensive necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. cANCA/PR3 antibodies were highly elevated (360 U/ml, upper reference limit 20 U/ml). Imaging [sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] revealed splenic infarction due to arteritis lienalis. There were no signs of kidney, lung, joint, or central nervous system involvement. He was treated with high-dose steroids (1 g/day over 3 days), followed by azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) and low-dose steroids as maintenance treatment. Owing to the splenic infarction caused by vasculitis of the splenic artery, he also received prophylactic antibiotic (penicillin) and anticoagulatory treatment (salicylic acid). The patient initially responded very well to the immunosuppressive treatment, and levels of PR3 antibodies normalized until May 2020. Consequently, glucocorticoids, salicylic acid, and penicillin could be discontinued. However, after discontinuation of steroid treatment, we detected another increase of PR3 antibodies up to 128 U/ml in June 2020, but owing to the good clinical apparition no further action was taken and levels of autoantibodies tended to decrease spontaneously.\n\nIn September 2020, he was admitted with a 2-week history of shortness of breath, even without physical activity, and inspiratory stridor. Moreover, he complained about hearing loss after discontinuation of glucocorticoid treatment. Lung function testing showed severe obstruction of the upper airways [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 50% of age norm] and a massively increased airway resistance [effective airway resistance (sReff) 1018% of age norm]. MRI revealed a circular subglottic tracheal narrowing over a length of 2 cm. The levels of the beforehand-elevated PR3 antibodies showed no further increase (93 U/ml). We initiated a high-dose steroid treatment for 3 days followed by four subsequent doses of rituximab (RTX, 375 mg/m2, cumulative dose: 4\u00d7700 mg) in 4-week intervals for remission induction according to the therapy protocol of the RAVE study. Clinical apparition and lung function parameters clearly improved under therapy, but the patient still reported shortness of breath under heavy physical activity and the flow profile in the body plethysmography still showed signs of tracheal stenosis. To match the decreasing dosages of oral glucocorticoids, he received inhalative corticosteroids (ICS; budesonide) together with a slow-acting bronchodilator (formoterol) in addition to the ongoing maintenance therapy with AZA on the occasion of a routine appointment in our pediatric pneumology department in November 2020. At that time, levels of PR3 antibodies also reached the normal range .\n\nFig. 1 Levels of proteinase-3 antibodies over the past 15 months since initial presentation. After November 2020, no proteinase-3 antibodies were detectable. Blue lines indicate the normal range Full size image\n\nAfter 3 months, in February 2021, his obstructive respiratory symptoms worsened as he complained about increasing inspiratory stridor. Blood gas analysis revealed a mild CO2 retention, and his lung function parameters showed a deterioration to similar values as in September 2020 (FEV1 55% of age norm, sReff 1039% of age norm). Again, we performed an MRI, which showed a circular subglottic tracheal narrowing over a length of 1.5 cm . To exclude further affection of the lower airways, we performed a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Direct laryngoscopy showed a Cotton\u2013Myer grade III subglottic stenosis, beginning 1 cm below the vocal cords with a length of 1.5 cm . A biopsy taken from the subglottic tracheal lesion revealed ongoing neutrophilic inflammation. Again, high-dose steroids were initiated, but, in contrast to the prior admission in September 2020, the patient responded poorly. After consideration of the increased risk of infection due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the persistently low B-cell count after the first RTX treatment, we decided against a second RTX cycle or other therapeutic alternatives (for example, cyclophosphamide) and initiated a TNF-\u03b1-antagonistic treatment with infliximab with a starting dose of 6 mg/kg. In induction phase, he received the first three doses in 2-week intervals, followed by 4-week intervals in maintenance phase. Moreover, AZA dosage was adapted to body weight. Our patient responded very well to the TNF-\u03b1-antagonistic treatment as his respiratory symptoms resolved completely and his lung function parameters normalized entirely (FEV1 92% of age norm, sReff 361% of age norm; Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 2 Radiological imaging of the subglottic tracheal stenosis in frontal (A) and transverse (B) plane.

The pain was described as electric in quality, shooting down the right arm to the right fingertips. He also reported decreased right proximal strength and swelling of the right hand. Neurological examination revealed joint stiffness, neck pain, arm numbness, arm weakness, and hand weakness. The patient also had restricted shoulder movements and extensive distal and proximal muscle wasting. The right arm was adducted, and the forearm was externally rotated. Muscle strength of the left upper extremity was 5/5; right upper extremity was 2/5, abduction was impaired. Flexion was weak in the wrist, 0/5 on flexion and extension of the fingers.

    "original_case": "We describe the case of a Caucasian 52-year-old woman, teacher, married. She was diagnosed with a hematological condition in January 2019, after presenting to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms and fever. She was initially diagnosed with an acute respiratory tract infection, new-onset pancytopenia, and febrile neutropenia. After admission to the hematology inpatient unit for treatment and further investigation, a bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy revealed a hypercellularity with 42% myeloblasts. Immunophenotyping showed 36.73% myeloblasts, CD34+, CD117+, and CD13+. Screening for gene rearrangements and mutations showed no recurrent mutation (FLT3, CEBPA, RUNX1, TP53 negative) and conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype.\n\nThis patient had previous medical history of essential hypertension and cholecystectomy, but took no chronic medication and there were no known allergies. There was no history of exposure to chemicals, alcohol, or tobacco. She had one successful pregnancy resulting in a healthy child with whom she lives in a rural area of Portugal together with her husband.\n\nOn examination, the patient appeared fatigued. Her temperature was 38.3 \u00b0C, blood pressure 137/77 mmHg, pulse 84 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and she had an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The conjunctiva and oral mucosa were pale. She was eupneic at rest, without signs of breathing difficulty. Jugular vein was normally distended. Pulmonary auscultation showed normal breathing sounds. The abdomen was soft and nontender, and there was no hepatosplenomegaly. No peripheral adenopathies were identified. Neurologic examination showed no abnormality, namely, the patient had a Glasgow Coma scale of 15 points; naming and repetition was intact and fluent, she followed the 3-step commands, there was no impairment in the function of the cranial nerves, motor, or sensory function, and without asymmetries. There was normal finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin movement, and no tremor nor dysmetria were observed. She had a bilateral symmetric flexor plantar response, with no Hoffman\u2019s or clonus. Her gait was normal.\n\nLaboratory hemogram showed the following: hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL; leukocytes 1940 cells/\u00b5L; neutrophils 230 cells/\u00b5L; lymphocytes 1650 cells/\u00b5L; eosinophils 0 cells/\u00b5L; basophils 0 cells/\u00b5L; monocytes 60 cells/\u00b5L; platelets 61,000 cells/\u00b5L. Blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and total and direct bilirubin were normal, as were results of renal function and thyroid function tests. Serologies with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) assay for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, Treponema pallidum antibody, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, toxoplasmosis, and herpes virus type 2 were negative; serologies for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and herpes virus type 1 were positive; and cytomegalovirus and Epstein\u2013Barr viral loads were negative. Protein electrophoresis showed marginal changes in alfa1, beta1, and beta2 fractions. Gamma fraction was normal. Colonization for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was investigated with a rectal swap and was positive.\n\nShe received her first line of chemotherapy according to the Idarubicin in combination with cytarabine regimen on 31 March 2019. As per protocol, the patient was started on prophylaxis for fungal and viral infections with oral fluconazole and oral acyclovir, and aggressive intravenous hydration was administered. On day +8, in deep medullary aplasia, a distal thrombophlebitis of the right lower limb with cutaneous bacterial infection was diagnosed and large spectrum antimicrobials were delivered. Three sets of blood cultures were collected, each set corresponding to an aerobic and an anaerobic culture medium flask. The samples were obtained by venipuncture in different sites and with a sterilized procedure. The protocol was repeated at 24 hours but no infectious agent was identified.\n\nOn day +11 after chemotherapy, she developed a fever, accompanied by a rise in inflammatory parameters. At observation, vulvar pain, swelling, and pruritus were present and a hard and painful phlegm could be seen in the right outer labia of the vulva, with exuberant surrounding inflammatory signs . After multidisciplinary discussion, previous antimicrobials were suspended, except colistin and empirically started intravenous acyclovir, intravenous tigecycline, and intravenous daptomycin. The lesion rapidly progressed in the following 48 hours, with extensive cellulitis of the perineal area and necrosis of affected tissues, accompanied by hematologic, neurologic, liver, and respiratory dysfunction (Fig. 2 A\u2013C). Again, three sets of blood cultures were collected, and vulvar exudate was collected with a swab. On blood cultures and vulvar exudate analysis, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated, with resistance to meropenem and amikacin. At this point, antibiotherapy was changed to intravenous ceftazidime/avibactam, intravenous meropenem, intravenous amikacin, intravenous vancomycin, and prophylactic oral acyclovir and oral posaconazole. This antibiotic regime was maintained for 13 days.\n\nA pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, showing no liquid or air collections . The surgical team performed superficial debridement of the soft tissue above the fascia of the pubic area extending down towards the right paragenital area. Postsurgery, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to maintained multiorgan dysfunction for a short period of time. At this point, the patient maintained vulvar necrotic tissue with less edema and cellulitis  but granulation tissue, serous exudate, and mummified pubic wound developed . Local infection control was partial with systemic inflammatory response.\n\nThe surgical team performed new debridement with extensive removal of necrotic and granulation tissue . Simultaneously, antibiotics were switched to intravenous colistin, intravenous daptomycin, and intravenous amphotericin B, while maintaining meropenem and amikacin; ceftazidime/avibactam and vancomycin were suspended. In the removed skin it was possible to isolate a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella. After the surgery and the last change of antibiotics, a rapid recovery was observed with progressive closure of the surgical wound and continued efforts in sterilization and cleansing of the exposed tissue, and with the support of pain team that implemented intensive anesthetic control.\n\nMeanwhile, we evaluated the hematological response to the induction on day +44 after chemotherapy. Bone marrow aspirate showed 9% blastic cells and 37% monocytoid cells, but the immune phenotype evaluation revealed a blastic population of 3.3% of the total cellularity. Therefore, the patient was considered in complete response after the first cycle of induction therapy. Afterwards, we decided to start 5-azacitidine until more intensive chemotherapy was possible.\n\nOn day seven after surgery, recurrence of local infiltration with cellulitis of the surgical borders and increased inflammatory C-reactive protein motivated new antibiotic rotation in an attempt to control bacteria from spreading . While intravenous ceftazidime/avibactam was resumed, colistin was suspended. Progressive local and systemic control of infection was observed after ceftazidime/avibactam introduction.\n\nSubsequently, the surgical wound continued to receive sterilization and cleansing with Dakin\u2019s solution, hydrogen peroxide, and the application of honey antimicrobial wound matrix. To ensure proper sterilization, negative pressure wound vacuum suction dressings were used with successful recovery of the wound with viable granulation tissue.\n\nFinally, a skin graft was performed 6 weeks after surgical debridement of the vulva and pubic area, using donor skin from the patient\u2019s right thigh . The procedure was executed by the plastic surgery team that maintained follow-up with regular application of hydration dressings that ensured good clinical evolution .\n\nMeanwhile, antimicrobial therapy was suspended after a 27-day course of ceftazidime/avibactam and maintained follow-up for 2 weeks free from antibiotics, with no evidence of recurrence of infection. On day 60 after performing the skin graft, the patient is asymptomatic, undergoing motor rehabilitation with excellent tolerance to exercise and excellent tissue healing. Lastly, we underline the extreme relevance of the remission of the hematological disease in accomplishing infectious control and the necessary tissue healing.",

    "original_case": "A 27-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of solitary pelvic kidney and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) presented for her scheduled robotic-assisted pyelolithotomy. Nine weeks prior to the procedure, she had presented to the emergency department (ED) with unrelenting left flank pain and nausea without fever or lower urinary tract symptoms. She noted that she had had repeat infections over the last few years requiring antibiotics, but never had a complete workup owing to a lack of insurance. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged solitary left pelvic kidney with severe hydronephrosis, perinephric stranding, and multiple large stones in the renal pelvis measuring up to 2.7 cm (Figs. 1 and 2). She underwent urgent percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tube placement with no complications. Urine culture at that time was negative. She was discharged on a 10-day prophylactic regimen of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. After obtaining indigent care funding, she was seen in clinic where a percutaneous nephrolithotomy was discussed; however, given her unique anatomy, she was scheduled for a robotic-assisted pyelolithotomy.\n\nFig. 1 Coronal slice of a computed tomography abdomen/pelvis showing a large stone burden in a solitary pelvic kidney Full size image Fig. 2 Axial slice of a computed tomography abdomen/pelvis showing a large stone burden in a solitary pelvic kidney Full size image Two weeks prior to her scheduled robotic-assisted pyelolithotomy, she returned to the ED for fever, chills, left lower quadrant abdominal pain, and bleeding from her nephrostomy bag. She was noted to be febrile at 38.7 \u00b0C and tachycardic up to 119 beats per minute. Her voided urinalysis was positive for nitrites and various inflammatory markers, concerning for a urinary tract infection. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis at that time demonstrated scattered multifocal patchy hypoattenuation throughout the renal cortex suggestive of cortical scarring and/or infection. She was admitted with a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis and was treated with empiric intravenous ceftriaxone. Final urine cultures noted pan-sensitive Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She was discharged on a 7-day regimen of cefpodoxime. No subsequent eradication cultures were obtained. Eight days after her discharge, she underwent a robotic-assisted pyelolithotomy without complications. At the conclusion of the case, the patient had only a double-J ureteral stent and her PCN was removed. On her second postoperative day, the patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and passing flatus. She reported mild suprapubic abdominal pain. We noted she was tachycardic in the low 100s but otherwise afebrile and hemodynamically stable. This was initially attributed to pain. She was subsequently started on piperacillin and tazobactam after her intraoperative urine culture returned positive for P. aeruginosa later that day. On the third postoperative day, the patient remained hemodynamically stable and continued to meet postoperative milestones, including passing flatus, but she had persistent tachycardia in the 130s. An electrocardiogram noted only sinus tachycardia. Her abdominal examination remained unchanged and benign. The sensitivity of the intraoperative urine culture returned highly susceptible to fluoroquinolones, and we transitioned her to oral ciprofloxacin. On the fourth postoperative day, she continued to have tachycardia now as high as 180s and began exhibiting abdominal distension. She also reported multiple frequent watery bowel movements. She continued to exhibit intermittent hypotension despite administration of intravenous fluids. Orthostatic vitals were negative. Lab work now revealed mild leukocytosis at 14,000 with a left shift. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed dilation of the large bowel and partial enhancement of the wall of the colon, suggestive of colitis (Figs. 3 and 4). Cardiology was consulted owing to the profound tachycardia, which they attributed to sepsis.\n\nFig. 3 Axial slice of a computed tomography abdomen/pelvis showing dilated large bowel with partial enhancement of the wall of the colon, suggestive of colitis Full size image Fig. 4 Coronal slice of a computed tomography abdomen/pelvis showing dilated large bowel with partial enhancement of the wall of the colon, suggestive of colitis Full size image The patient was transferred to surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Though she had no prior history of infections, her recent fluoroquinolone use, CT findings, and overall clinical presentation were strongly suggestive of sepsis; thus, a stool toxin test was conducted. Aside from a possible infection, early concerns arose that the patient may have had an incompletely treated UTI or an infected intraabdominal fluid collection. As a result, ciprofloxacin was stopped and ertapenem was started. Additionally, a regimen of oral and rectal vancomycin was initiated. Despite these measures, the patient continued to have tachycardia with rising leukocytosis and intermittent fever. On postoperative day 6, her toxin test returned positive and she was started on additional intravenous metronidazole. While in the ICU, she was managed by an interdisciplinary team led by surgical intensivists, including infectious disease, internal medicine, cardiology, general surgery, and nutrition. On postoperative day 8, repeat abdominopelvic imaging showed worsening of her diffuse colonic dilation with diffuse mucosal enhancement and mural thickening. Fidaxomicin was added to the antibiotic regimen, and the oral vancomycin dosage was increased. Her abdominal examination continued to show distension and mild tenderness to palpation in all quadrants. On postoperative day 12, she remained largely unchanged and a repeated CT abdomen and pelvis showed a distension of the entire colon measuring up to 8 cm at the transverse colon with bowel wall edema. This was consistent with toxic megacolon . On the following day, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with a subtotal colectomy and ileostomy creation.",

The presenting complaints were fever, severe abdominal pain with distension about 2 weeks after delivery, and altered levels of consciousness (ALOC) presenting 2 days before admission. She had a high-grade fever, undocumented, without chills and rigors, relieved with medications, and associated with severe generalized abdominal pain. Abdominal pain was sharp, constant, had no aggravating or relieving factors, and was associated with bloating and distension. Over the past 2 days she developed altered mentation in which she was talking inappropriately, not recognizing close family members, and getting drowsier. She was primigravida and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery 2 weeks before this hospital admission, after which she gradually developed the above symptoms. However, she did not have a significant medical history. Family history was also unremarkable. On physical examination, she was pale, tachycardiac (heart rate was 120 bpm), and tachypneic (respiratory rate was 32 breaths/minute). She had a Glasgow Coma scale score of 8/15, so was electively intubated. Her motor examination was unremarkable, while the rest of the neurological exam cannot be accessed due to low mentation. Her cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were insignificant. In the abdomen, examination revealed a soft, distended abdomen with hepatomegaly and positive shifting dullness. There was no tenderness in the abdomen. An investigation was then conducted to determine the cause of her symptoms. Her initial laboratory investigations are presented in . Based on her high polymorphic leukocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, it was suspected that she had acute bacterial meningitis. Hence, empirical antibiotics in meningitic doses were given. Despite treatment, her central nervous system examination showed no improvement.

    "original_case": "A 74-year-old Caucasian man was referred to the emergency department in May 2018, presenting with mild and reversible neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple ischemic strokes. The patient was taking aspirin 100 mg daily as secondary prophylaxis for ischemic and valvular cardiopathy treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stent positioning in 2007, and with an aortocoronary bypass operation and biological aortic valve replacement for bicuspid aortic valve in 2008. In addition, patient history was notable for an urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with radical cystectomy 2 years prior to the actual hospitalization. A cardioembolic origin of the cerebral ischemic was suspected, but atrial fibrillation could not be confirmed during repeated cardiac evaluations. Aspirin was replaced by the direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban. In the following 2 months, the patient had two recurrent episodes of myocardial ischemia: the first involving a thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and the second due to a reocclusion of the same vessel despite adequate triple antithrombotic therapy with aspirin 100 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg. A low platelet count was already noted at the time of these investigations (95 \u00d7 10^9/L), further decreasing down to 63 \u00d7 10^9/L at the time of the second discharge. A comprehensive hemato-oncological workup was carried out to investigate the persistent thrombocytopenia and spontaneous cutaneous bleeding events of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2 while on antithrombotic triple therapy. Comprehensive laboratory studies revealed moderate thrombocytopenia of 52 \u00d7 10^9/L, with the other two lines preserved. No schistocytes or dysplastic elements were observed in the peripheral blood smear. Furthermore, coagulation studies revealed markedly reduced fibrinogen levels (0.5 g/L; normal range 1.7\u20134.5 g/L), elevated D-dimer levels of 6.97 mg/L (normal range < 0\u20135 mg/L), a reduced Quick value of 59% (normal range 70\u2013100%), and a shortened activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT) of 21 seconds (normal range 25\u201337 seconds), but no relevant rivaroxaban activity (39 ng/mL). Vitamin K, haptoglobin, direct Coombs test, careening for anti-PF4 antibodies, and ADAMTS13 activity were within the normal range. The clinical presentation and the laboratory results revealed a picture compatible with overt DIC; consequently, the patient underwent a neoplasia screening. A bone marrow biopsy showed no signs of dysplasia or pathological lymphoid and plasmacellular infiltrates. Karyotype analysis confirmed a normal male karyotype. However, next-generation sequencing showed mutations in TET2 and EZH2, compatible with a diagnosis of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which, despite its greater risk for hematological malignancies, has been shown to increase mortality from nonhematological cancers and cardiovascular disease, could not alone explain the repeated cardiovascular events experienced by our patient and the coagulation activation. Given the high clinical suspicion of an underlying neoplastic disease or chronic infection responsible for the observed coagulation activation, a fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was performed, and showed few retroperitoneal and left supraclavicular lymph nodes with moderate metabolic activity . The biopsy and histological workup resulted in the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated carcinoma of urothelial origin . In our institution, the treatment of choice for a patient with metastatic urothelial cancer would have been combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and either cisplatin or, alternatively, carboplatin in case of ineligibility for cisplatin. However, owing to concerns regarding the hematotoxicity of standard chemotherapy, and the high risk of bleeding in case of worsening of the thrombocytopenia in a patient in need of antithrombotic prophylaxis, we decided to treat the patient with immunotherapy only. The first administration of atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, resulted in an improvement of the chronic DIC with normalization of the platelet count and marked reduction of the D-dimer levels from 15 to 1 mg/L (Fig 3). After the first 3 months of treatment, the patient underwent a restaging through a FDG-PET scan, which showed a good metabolic response, without any sign of dimensional increase or appearance of new lesions. The DIC remained well controlled, giving us the opportunity to switch the antithrombotic therapy from aspirin plus low molecular weight heparin to aspirin plus rivaroxaban 20 mg/day.

TTP is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and organ damage. It is caused by deficiency of the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) enzyme, which normally cleaves von Willebrand factor. This leads to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in small blood vessels, resulting in organ damage. The patient's history of cardiac procedures, recurrent myocardial ischemia, and thrombocytopenia, as well as abnormal coagulation parameters, are consistent with TTP. The presence of a neoplasm, particularly a urothelial carcinoma, is also a known cause of TTP. The patient's response to immunotherapy further supports the diagnosis of TTP.",

    "original_case": "A 4-year-old Albanian girl from a rural area was referred to the Department of Neurology of the University Clinical Centre of Kosovo because of abdominal pain, progressive weakness in the lower limbs, and walking difficulty. Prenatal and postnatal history: She was the fourth child in the family and was born as a result of a full-term pregnancy that was not well controlled. No history of drug use or exposure to radiation during pregnancy was reported. Delivery was completed at a regional hospital; she had a birth weight (BW) of 3500 g. Treatment with retinol and cholecalciferol (AD3) for prevention of vitamin D deficiency and vaccinations were irregular. She was breastfed for 1 year, and supplementary food was introduced at 5 months. Her growth and development were normal, and this was her first hospitalization. Family history: Her aunt died from breast cancer at 35 years of age. Disease history: The first symptoms appeared 2 months before admission and consisted of profuse sweating of the head, neck, and upper part of the body, mostly at night, followed by progressive abdominal pain. Therefore, she sought medical attention and was treated with analgesic and antiparasitic therapy. Despite treatment, the abdominal pain persisted, became more progressive, and was followed by musculoskeletal manifestations in the lower limbs. In general, the physical examination at admission revealed a relatively good general condition; she weighed 15 kg and was conscious, alert and communicative. Moreover, a physical examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed no erythema or swelling, but a reduced range of motion in the lower limbs with no weight-bearing tolerance was observed. In addition, muscle tonus was decreased in the lower limbs, whereas it was within the normal range with intact sensory perception in the upper limbs. The abdomen was slightly distended, soft upon palpation, and not painful. Furthermore, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was within the normal range for her age; likewise, clinical findings in other systems were within normal limits. Initially, the results of routine blood tests showed a normal blood cell count; hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.2 g/dl, and platelet count was 249,000/mm3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour, and C-reactive protein was negative [1.2 mg/l, normal range (NR) > 6 mg/l]. Furthermore, liver enzymes, coagulogram, urea and creatinine, and acid\u2013base status of the blood were normal. However, her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 536 U/l at admission continued to increase to 3520 U/l (NR 160\u2013450 U/l). In addition, a progressive decrease in total serum proteins from 6.0 to 2.9 g/dl (6.3\u20138.0 g/dl) was observed. Other investigations, including urinalysis and urine and blood culture, were negative; abdominal ultrasound was also unremarkable. Owing to progressive weakness in the lower limbs and walking difficulties, this patient was initially suspected to have acute polyradiculoneuritis (Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome), and thus, lumbar puncture was performed. Cytology and biochemical analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed white cells 10 cells/mm (100% monocytes) and proteins 44.1 g/dl (NR 15\u201340 g/dl), while the CSF glucose level was normal compared with the plasma values. Moreover, electromyoneurography (EMNG) revealed a reduced amplitude and velocity of the M wave for the peroneus and tibial nerve on both sides. Therefore, she was suspected to have polyradiculoneuritis and was treated with corticosteroids and immunoglobulins. However, this medication did not improve her clinical condition. Instead, during the second week of treatment, the child began to experience dry cough, chest discomfort, and worsening dyspnea. Therefore, she was transferred to the intensive care unit. Chest radiography revealed a hyperdense homogeneous shadow occupying almost the entire right hemithorax with a slight mediastinal shift to the left, which suggested a massive right-sided mass, while no pleural effusion was noted . Fig. 1 Frontal chest radiograph showing a large homogeneous mass occupying the entire right hemithorax, with a slight mediastinal shift to the left, which suggests a posterior mediastinal location Full size image Subsequently, chest computed tomography (CT) was performed, which revealed a large mass of homogeneous density that may have originated in the posterior mediastinum; this mass occupied the entire right hemithorax. A left mediastinal displacement was described with compression of the principle bronchus and minimal pleural leakage (effusion) . Fig. 2 A plain axial chest computed tomography scan showing a large well-defined hypodense mass in the right hemithorax that was derived from the posterior mediastinum. Expansive growth was observed in all directions, which shifted the mediastinal structures in the anterolateral left direction Full size image Moreover, since tumors such as neuroblastoma were suspected, the levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) in urine were determined and were found to be negative. Furthermore, echocardiography revealed that the heart had shifted down and to the left without pericardial effusion. On the right side of the hemithorax, pleural effusion was noted around the homogeneous mass; however, when thoracentesis was performed, only 90 ml hemorrhagic fluid could be aspirated from the right infrascapular area after repeated attempts. A pleural fluid study yielded fluid with a reddish color, and cytological examination predominantly showed elements of peripheral blood, while the microbiological culture was negative. Furthermore, contrast CT of the thorax and abdomen revealed a large heterogeneously enhancing mass 95 \u00d7 75 \u00d7 70 mm in size in the right hemithorax, with central necrotic areas that likely originated from the outlet roots of spinal nerves of the spinal canal, which shifted the right lung and mediastinal organs. Minimal pleural effusion was observed in the phrenicocostal right sinus (hemorrhagic), with the drain located around the mass that was functional. Moreover, no adenopathy was detected in the mediastinum or axillary regions, and abdominal CT scans were unremarkable . Fig. 3 Axial contrast-enhanced computed tomography indicating the heterogeneous nature of the tumor with vital solid areas and central necrotizing areas. Blood vessels and aerogenic structures are shifted, but no signs of macroscopic invasion are observed. There are also no signs of bone destruction or a direct connection to the spinal canal. Imaging data are highly suggestive of peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs) Full size image For the histopathological diagnosis, during CT, a percutaneous needle biopsy of the right mass was performed. Consequently, the histopathology of the examined tissue cylinders identified tumor tissue composed of poorly differentiated malignant small round cells with dark staining, cells with round nuclei (\u201csmall round blue cells\u201d), and a confluence of necrotic foci, which suggests the tumor type of blastoma . Conclusively, immunohistochemical (IHC) examination of the markers CD99 , S-100 , and Ki-67  showed that the tumor cells stained positively for S-100 and CD99. Specifically, the proliferative index measured by Ki-67 was approximately 20%.

The differential diagnosis included postanoxic encephalopathy, a metabolic disorder, infectious cause, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, intoxication, meningitis, and conversion. The patient looked neglected and underweight. Vital signs showed a heart rate of 105/minute, blood pressure 150/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 21/minute, SpO2 98% with nonrebreathing mask, and temperature 36.9 \u00b0C. The patient was unresponsive, with a Glasgow Coma scale of 3, pupils were 6 mm in diameter, equal and reactive to light. She was immediately intubated for airway protection and mechanically ventilated. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was negative for signs of aspiration and pressures were within normal range. Laboratory results: hemoglobin (Hb) 7.0 mmol/L, platelets 151 \u00d7\u200910^9/L, white blood cells (WBC) 6.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L, creatinine 91 \u03bcmol/L, urea 12.5 mmol/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 114 mg/L, Na 138 mmol/L, K 3.4 mmol/L, Ca 2.24 mmol/L, Mg 0.84 mmol/L, creatine kinase (CK) 20 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 17 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 15 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 51 U/L, albumin 33.5 g/L, ammonia 11 mmol/L, glucose 9 mmol/L, arterial blood gas pH 7.30, pO2 9.44 kPa, pCO2 6.72 kPa, HCO3 24.1 mmol/L, and base excess 2.7 mmol/L. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an intraventricular conductive disorder .\n\nFig. 1\nThe electrocardiogram on admission showed an intraventricular conductive disorder with QRS of 150 ms\nFull size image\n\nQualitative analyses for drugs of abuse (Syva RapidTest d.a.u., Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Ltd., Frimley, Camberley, UK) in the urine were negative for cannabis, opiates, (methyl)amphetamines, methadone, benzodiazepines, and cocaine. Paracetamol plasma concentration was < 10 mg/L. A computed tomography (CT) angiography of the head showed no signs of recent ischemia nor significant intracranial vessel occlusions. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed diffuse nonspecific nonepileptiform background slowing . This is commonly observed in patients with an encephalopathy or induced by a drug intoxication.\n\nFig. 2\nElectroencephalogram on admission. Symmetrical pattern with excess of slow activity with generalized predominant synchronous frequencies of theta (4\u20137 Hz) and delta (1\u20133 Hz) throughout the background, most likely appropriate to the diagnosis of metabolic or toxic encephalopathy\nFull size image\n\nThe next morning, the patient\u2019s family clarified that the patient had complaints of anxiety and depressive thoughts, suffered from significant weight loss, and had a poor performance status. She had gone to bed at around midnight in fair condition and was found comatose by her daughter next morning at 11:00 AM. There were no signs of a deliberate overdose, for example no empty medicine strips were found. Contact with her general practitioner revealed that amitriptyline had been prescribed intermittently from 2014 to September 2019. However, amitriptyline had not been prescribed in the year prior to her admission. Therefore, the patient was believed to have resumed medication on her own initiative. This would also explain her ECG changes, mydriasis due to anticholinergic effects, and her comatose state. Because of the suspicion of a tricyclic antidepressant intoxication, plasma levels were determined. An amitriptyline plasma concentration of 1030 \u03bcg/L and a nortriptyline (active metabolite) plasma concentration of 380 \u03bcg/L were found, resulting in a sum concentration of 1410 \u03bcg/L (therapeutic range sum 100\u2013300 \u03bcg/L) . Plasma concentrations of amitriptyline and nortriptyline higher than 500 \u03bcg/L are considered to be potentially toxic.\n\nFig. 3\nPlasma concentrations of amitriptyline and active metabolite nortriptyline\nFull size image\n\nSodium bicarbonate was administered to lower the free fraction of amitriptyline. In addition, symptomatic treatment was initiated, using diazepam for convulsions and extended cardiac monitoring. Since concentrations were high and comatose state persisted, impaired clearance was suspected. Analysis of genetic variations in cytochrome (CYP)450 isoenzymes, which play a major role in metabolism of amitriptyline, was performed. Genetic variations in CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 were determined by real-time PCR (validated TaqMan StepOnePlus assay). DNA sequence analysis was used to validate the genotyping procedure. The patient was found to be a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (homozygous CYP2D6*4 and homozygous CYP2D6*10) and a CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer (CYP2C19*1/*17). CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status leads to reduced degradation of nortriptyline, increasing the concentration of this metabolite.",

    "original_case": "A 73-year-old Caucasian female, never smoker, with a past medical history of hypertension was diagnosed in October 2008. She received chemotherapy with capecitabine, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (XELOX) and bevacizumab for five cycles, then underwent a right hemicolectomy and a partial hepatectomy followed by maintenance therapy with bevacizumab. In February 2011, she was initiated on fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and cetuximab for disease progression in the liver. In May 2011, she underwent a resection of the new hepatic lesion followed by intra-arterial chemoembolization sessions for 3 months. Three years later, in August 2014, a positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography (PET\u2013CT) scan showed evidence of metastatic retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, consistent with disease recurrence. She was then initiated on mFOLFOX-6 with bevacizumab with a good imaging response, followed by a year of maintenance therapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and bevacizumab. In December 2016, her treatment plan was switched to fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) for disease progression to the lungs, followed by maintenance therapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and bevacizumab. A few months later, in August 2017, a PET\u2013CT scan showed a new lung nodule. She was then shifted to mFOLFOX6 with panitumumab followed by maintenance therapy with fluorouracil and leucovorin. In May 2018, the treatment protocol was changed to FOLFIRI with cetuximab, until a new disease progression in the lymph nodes, and then around the hepatic artery stent, occurred in January 2019. The patient was then reinitiated on mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab. She received her first cycle on 21 February and later experienced an episode of neutropenia for which the second cycle was delayed. On 11 March, she received her second cycle of chemotherapy with a 25% dose reduction. On 13 March, she presented to the emergency department with fatigue, malaise, orbital headache, nausea and vomiting, mild abdominal pain, and chills. She stated that her symptoms started hours after the chemotherapy infusion and reported a decrease in urine output and a darkening of urine. On physical examination, the patient had jaundice with icteric sclera since a day ago. Her vitals showed a temperature of 37.1 \u00b0C, a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, a blood pressure of 16.7/7.2 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. A cardiac workup ruled out acute myocardial infarction. The initial blood workup was significant for thrombocytopenia (platelet count 30.10^3 cells/mm^3) and anemia (hemoglobin 8.1 mg/dL). The anemia was defined as hemolytic by markedly increased bilirubin (total bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 3.3 mg/dL), high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (1725 IU/L), high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (4866 IU/L), and low haptoglobin (< 0.1 g/L). The patient also showed signs of acute renal failure (serum creatinine had markedly increased from 0.9 to 5.5 mg/dL within a week, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 78 mg/dL, and uric acid 10.6 mg/dL). The blood film inspection showed signs of hemolysis with a slight anisopoikilocytosis, slight hypochromia, some ovalocytes and echinocytes, few schistocytes and helmet cells, rare teardrop red blood cells, and rare stomatocytes. There were also occasional polychromatophilic red blood cells (reticulocytosis). Antibody screening was negative, confirming the diagnosis. The coagulation panel was normal. Relevant laboratory parameters are documented in . Her chronic medications included irbesartan/amlodipine and atenolol. The clinical laboratory findings were consistent with a significant picture of the predominance of renal failure. An ADAMTS13 activity test was performed to investigate a potential condition. Treatment was started promptly with daily plasma exchange and immunosuppression with methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) until a diagnosis was ruled out, then tapered later on. She also received packed red blood cell transfusions and platelet transfusions, and underwent daily intermittent hemodialysis. Electrolyte imbalances were also managed. Seven days later, the patient\u2019s laboratory studies () showed a stable hemoglobin level, a much-improved platelet count, and no clinical evidence of hemolysis. Her platelet count normalized on day 12. Daily plasma exchange was continued for eight consecutive days, and dialysis for eight consecutive days. The patient was transferred to another medical center in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for continuity of care and possible treatment.",

Chemotherapy-induced TMA is a rare but potentially fatal complication of chemotherapy, characterized by the development of thrombocytopenia, non-immune hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure. The pathogenesis of chemotherapy-induced TMA is not fully understood but is thought to involve endothelial damage and microvascular thrombosis. The most common chemotherapy agents associated with TMA are platinum-based agents, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, and alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Other agents, including gemcitabine, docetaxel, and bevacizumab, have also been reported to cause TMA. The patient's history of recent chemotherapy with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab, as well as her laboratory findings, are consistent with a diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced TMA.",
