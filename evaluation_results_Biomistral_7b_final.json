His physical examination showed abdominal distention and tenderness. The vital signs were stable, and there was mild dehydration. All laboratory results were normal. Plain X-rays revealed a dilated bowel with air\u2013fluid levels. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study showed dilated bowels in the upper part of the abdomen, including the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum . Intravenous fluids were administered, and nasogastric tubes were placed. On laparotomy, a band was found connecting the mesentery of the descending colon to the mesentery of the jejunum, with an entrapped loop of jejunum between the band and the mesentery . The appearance of the intestines was normal with normal blood supply. This band was ligated and excised without bowel resection . Histological examination revealed fibrotic tissue with blood vessels and no malignant changes.",
    "rewritten_case": "A preadolescent Syrian boy was brought to our medical facility presenting with episodes of greenish vomiting, occasional constipation, and intermittent abdominal discomfort. The duration of these symptoms remained uncertain. Upon examination, the boy exhibited abdominal swelling and sensitivity, with vital signs remaining within normal limits. Mild dehydration was also observed. Laboratory tests did not show any abnormalities. Radiographic imaging revealed an enlarged bowel with air-fluid levels. A contrast study of the upper gastrointestinal tract displayed distension in the upper abdominal bowels, including the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. The patient was given intravenous fluids, and nasogastric tubes were inserted. Eventually, a surgical exploration was conducted, revealing a band connecting the mesentery of the descending colon to that of the jejunum, with a loop of jejunum trapped between the band and the mesentery. The overall appearance of the intestines was normal with an unimpaired blood supply. This band was tied off and removed without necessitating bowel resection. The histological analysis of the excised tissue showed fibrosis with blood vessels present, but no signs of malignancy.",

    "original_case": "Here we present a case of a middle-eastern female patient who developed onychotillomania at the age of 17 years. The patient was a healthy Middle Eastern teenage female who developed symptoms around the age of 16 years, precipitated by a stressful event. The patient experienced recurrent, intrusive, distressing, and time-consuming obsessional thoughts of being surveilled through her phone. These obsessions also made her functionally impaired. Consequently, the patient started to avoid using the phone and eventually damaged it. Nevertheless, her symptoms persisted even with a new phone. Furthermore, the patient was worried about harm to her family, although this symptom did not qualify as an anxiety disorder. The patient had no other symptoms, nor did her symptoms meet the criteria for psychotic disorders. She was under the care of another physician at the time of onset of the condition, and was treated with fluoxetine, which was changed to paroxetine with clear justification. The patient commenced paroxetine 20 mg titrated to 30 mg daily and started showing improvements. However, 5 months later, her symptoms relapsed with depressive features and floating passive suicide ideation. Additionally, she demonstrated nail picking that was mainly directed towards the big toes and the skin around the nails using only her fingers. On examination, the lateral nail fold was erythematous and swollen with bleeding in both big toes, which may indicate a distolateral ingrowth and the nails showed scales and signs of distal nail tearing by the patient. Sometimes the patient\u2019s injuries required bandaging (Figs. 1 and 2). These symptoms were distressing, occurred daily, and were preceded by an urge and followed by a relief. However, they were not difficult to resist, which could be due to the paroxetine intake at the time. This complaint was not related to anxiety or depressive symptoms, and the patient had no other body-focused repetitive behaviors. Subsequently, the dose of paroxetine was increased to 40 mg. Two months later, the patient started to experience side effects that included weight gain and difficulty in urination. Medication was switched to fluoxetine at a dose of 20 mg titrated, which was later increased to 40 mg daily. After the resolution of symptoms, upon the patient\u2019s request, 6\u20137 months later, the medication was reduced. The fluoxetine dose was tapered and discontinued over 3 months without any relapse in symptoms. However, 2\u20133 months later, the symptoms relapsed and treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg was recommenced. At the time of writing this report, approximately 2 months after restarting fluoxetine, the patient\u2019s condition had partially improved and the nail-picking behavior remained remitted.",
    "rewritten_case": "In this case, we discuss a patient, a Middle Eastern female, who suffered from onychotillomania. The symptoms of this young, previously healthy woman, began appearing during her late teenage years, seemingly triggered by a stressful occurrence. She experienced pervasive, invasive, troubling, and time-consuming obsessive thoughts of being monitored through her phone, which significantly impacted her daily functioning. \n\nAs a result, she initiated an avoidance behavior towards her phone and even went to the extent of damaging it. However, switching to a new phone did not alleviate her symptoms. The patient also expressed concerns about her family's safety, but this did not amount to an anxiety disorder. Her symptoms did not align with psychotic disorders either. She was under the care of another physician when her condition surfaced and was initially treated with fluoxetine, which was later appropriately replaced by paroxetine.\n\nUpon starting paroxetine, which was initially dosed at 20 mg and later increased to 30 mg daily, she began to show signs of improvement. Yet, she later experienced a relapse of symptoms, which now included depressive features and passive suicidal thoughts. Concurrently, she displayed a behavior of nail picking, focusing primarily on her big toes and the skin surrounding the nails using her fingers. An examination revealed erythematous and swollen lateral nail folds with bleeding in both big toes, suggesting distolateral ingrowth, and signs of distal nail tearing. Occasionally, her self-inflicted injuries necessitated bandaging. These daily symptoms were distressing for the patient, but the urge was not hard to resist, possibly due to the paroxetine. \n\nThis behavior was not associated with her anxiety or depressive symptoms and she did not exhibit any other body-focused repetitive behaviors. As a result, her paroxetine dosage was increased to 40 mg. However, she began experiencing side effects such as weight gain and difficulty urinating, leading to a switch back to fluoxetine, the dosage of which was gradually increased to 40 mg daily. \n\nUpon symptom resolution, the patient requested a reduction in medication. The fluoxetine was tapered off over a period and eventually discontinued without any immediate relapse in symptoms. However, the symptoms did reappear after a gap and she was put back on 20 mg of fluoxetine. At the time of documenting this report, the patient had shown some improvement and the nail-picking behavior had subsided since restarting fluoxetine.",

He was asymptomatic and reported no pain or restrictions in movement or other clinical findings aside from the bulging, which resolved under local pressure. The patient had been misdiagnosed and operated on 10 years ago with the impression of a left inguinal hernia; however, no hernia sac was detected at that time. Five years later, the patient developed left lower extremity varicose veins. On physical examination, severe varicose veins of the left lower extremity with a soft, nonpulsatile, reducible inguinal bulging were detected that became more prominent by performing the Valsalva maneuver .

However, the surgery did not reveal any hernia sac. Some time after this surgery, he developed varicose veins in his left lower extremity. The physical examination showed severe varicose veins in the same extremity. The inguinal bulging was soft, nonpulsatile, and reducible, and it became even more pronounced when the patient performed the Valsalva maneuver.\n\nThe patient's features led to a color Doppler sonography of the left lower extremity venous system.

For the last 2 years, pain at the right wrist joint level and fourth finger flexion failure had also occurred. All the symptoms were induced by wrist and fourth finger flexion and extension. Recently, the patient had noted weakening of the right wrist. Examination did not reveal any visible or palpable pathology at the wrist level. Weakening of the right wrist was noted while the patient was grabbing the examiners\u2019 hand. Neurological examination revealed reduced sensitivity (pain) via the median nerve area at the right wrist. Triggering at the right wrist was noted during flexion and extension of the radiocarpal joint. Despite the obvious presence of carpal tunnel syndrome, Tinel\u2019s sign was not present. MRI of the right wrist was performed: no pathological masses were seen inside the carpal tunnel. The compression of the right median nerve was confirmed by electroneuromyography. Carpal tunnel release was performed. The tumor was attached to the flexor superficialis tendon sheath and was moving through the carpal tunnel via fourth finger and wrist flexion and extension. The tumor was excised, and the wound was closed . A morphological study was performed . Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for differential diagnosis with peripheral nerve tumors . The tumor was composed of cells with a myoid phenotype . The postoperative protocol included positioning the hand in a resting splint, regular wound dressings, and antibiotics for 3 days. All fingers were left free for regular active finger exercises. The patient was discharged after 3 days of the postoperative period. Sutures were removed after 2 weeks after surgery.

She had no history of illness, and biochemical parameters and tumor markers were within normal limits. Helicobacter pylori antibodies were negative, and EGD showed atrophic changes associated with previous H. pylori infection. An irregular depressed lesion measuring 25 mm in diameter was found on the posterior wall of the lower body (Fig. 1 a, b). Narrow-band imaging (NBI) revealed a demarcation line consistent with the surface of the depression . The surface structure within the depression was obscured, and the vessels were of variable caliber, with a network or collapsed network structure . Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with a well-differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma [tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1\u20132)], and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed .

Histologically, the tumor was composed of two components [tub2 adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (NEC)], and it showed submucosal and lymphatic invasion. As shown in Fig. 2 c, histopathological examination revealed tub2 adenocarcinoma in the anal-side depression. In the oral-side depression, tumor cells lacked glandular structures and had nested trabecular or acinar-like structures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for synaptophysin and CD56, and chromogranin partially, confirming the diagnosis of NEC. We determined that additional surgical resection was necessary due to submucosal and lymphatic invasion and laparoscopic pyloric gastrectomy was performed.

He was referred to our hospital after the enlargement of the plantar ulcer with an increase in pus discharge, which made it difficult to walk. Radiography revealed that the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe was destroyed and showed osteolytic changes . A biochemical analysis revealed the following: white blood cell (WBC), 9.710^9/L; red blood cell (RBC), 4.210^12/L; c-reactive protein (CRP), 13.8 mg/L; and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c, 6.8% (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program; NGSP). The PTA findings included complete occlusion of the middle portion of the anterior tibial artery, 75% occlusion of the proximal portion of the posterior tibial artery, and 95% occlusion of the peroneal artery. Fig. 1 Pus discharge of the right plantar ulcer increased and the metatarsophalangeal joint of the second toe was destroyed and showed osteolytic changes.

    "original_case": "The patient was a 28-year-old Iranian man who presented with right shoulder pain and hoarseness 1 week prior to admission. Going through his medical records, we realized that he had undergone an open right subclavian artery bypass for acute right upper extremity ischemia caused by thrombosis in the aneurysmal right subclavian artery to the distal arterial branches around 1.5 years ago. However, follow-up imaging suggested occlusion in the bypass area. Given the history of recurrent oral aphthous lesions and extensive body folliculitis lesions, a specific condition was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 test, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 79, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 5.2 (normal: 0.5), as well as pathological findings from the open right subclavian artery bypass surgery. Cyclophosphamide therapy was the treatment of choice for the patient, but due to infertility concerns, he refused. Therefore, he was treated with azathioprine 100 mg daily, prednisolone 30 mg daily, colchicine 1 mg daily, and rivaroxaban 20 mg daily postoperatively. The patient\u2019s compliance was good, and according to the latest rheumatological reports prior to his admission to our facility, his condition was under control and no hypercoagulable symptoms were observed. After admitting the patient, with all his past history in mind, we requested a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) with suspicion of a vascular pathology causing pressure effect on the recurrent laryngeal nerves. CTA revealed a 32 \u00d7 27 mm ruptured pseudoaneurysm originating from innominate artery bifurcation with a 90 \u00d7 61 \u00d7 65 mm hematoma extending to the right shoulder and forming an extrapleural hematoma at the apex of the right thoracic cavity . The trachea was deviated to the left side due to the mass effect of the pseudoaneurysm. Despite total occlusion of the right subclavian and axillary arteries by thrombosis, the patient had no complaint regarding his right upper extremity, which shows that there was probably sufficient collateral blood perfusion. Even though we retrospectively reexamined his previous CTA from the former admission, no anomaly was found in the innominate artery. We decided to repair the ruptured pseudoaneurysm by an endovascular approach. Preoperatively, the patient received methylprednisolone to decrease postoperative complications. In a hybrid operation room, we performed a digital subtraction angiography. Unfortunately, owing to the lack of proper landing zone, we could not perform an endovascular repair by stent graft. Inevitably, we approached the pseudoaneurysm by a median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension. After excising the ruptured pseudoaneurysm and evacuating the surrounding hematoma, we performed an innominate artery to the right common carotid artery bypass with a 6 mm expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft, which passed right behind the innominate vein . The pressure effect of the pseudoaneurysm was removed from the right recurrent laryngeal, phrenic, and vagus nerves with no neural damage. We decided not to perform a right subclavian artery bypass since it was previously thrombosed, and the patient had no complaint concerning the right upper extremity.",
    "rewritten_case": "The patient, a 28-year-old male of Iranian descent, presented with right shoulder discomfort and a week's history of hoarseness. He had undergone a right subclavian artery bypass 1.5 years prior to treat acute right upper extremity ischemia as a result of thrombosis in the aneurysmal right subclavian artery extending to the distal arterial branches. A subsequent imaging review revealed occlusion in the bypass area. The patient's medical history included recurrent oral aphthous lesions and widespread body folliculitis lesions, leading to a suspicion of a specific medical condition.\n\nLaboratory tests showed a positive human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 test, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 79, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 5.2 (normal: 0.5). Additionally, we noted an irregularity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which showed a slightly elevated red blood cell count, although no clear cause was found. With these results and the pathological findings from the bypass surgery, a diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome (BS) was made. \n\nThe patient was prescribed cyclophosphamide therapy, but due to concerns about infertility, he declined this option. Instead, he was treated postoperatively with a daily regimen of azathioprine 100 mg, prednisolone 30 mg, colchicine 1 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg. The patient's condition was well-managed with this treatment plan, as indicated by the latest rheumatological reports. \n\nUpon his admission, we obtained a contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) due to a suspicion of vascular pathology causing pressure on the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The CTA revealed a 32 \u00d7 27 mm ruptured pseudoaneurysm originating from innominate artery bifurcation with a large hematoma extending to the right shoulder. Interestingly, the CTA also showed a slight dilation of the carotid siphon and bifurcation, which, coupled with the elevated red blood cell count in the CSF analysis, could have potentially misled us towards considering a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nDespite total occlusion of the right subclavian and axillary arteries due to thrombosis, the patient had no complaints about his right upper extremity, suggesting sufficient collateral blood perfusion. The patient underwent a surgical procedure to repair the ruptured pseudoaneurysm. Unfortunately, an endovascular approach was not feasible due to a lack of proper landing zone. Therefore, the pseudoaneurysm was approached through a median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension. Postoperatively, the patient received methylprednisolone to reduce possible complications. \n\nIn conclusion, despite the misleading signs suggesting a possible nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, the patient was ultimately correctly diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et's syndrome presenting with a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the innominate artery. The patient's condition continues to be monitored and managed.",

Few minutes after receiving gadolinium during MRI, she presented to the ED with shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Upon admission, she had a brief period of loss of consciousness and her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 84/40 mmHg; temperature, 36.4 \u00b0C; heart rate (HR), 122 beats per minute; respiratory rate (RR), 30 breaths per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 78%. Her pulmonary auscultation revealed bilateral rales, but she did not have rash, or tongue or lip swelling. Despite significant hypoxemia, she was able to speak in whole sentences, and inhaled oxygen was delivered through a non-rebreather mask (NRBM) at 10 L per minute. She immediately received 500 mg of hydrocortisone and a 1 L bolus of intravenous crystalloids, but epinephrine was not administered upon the patient\u2019s presentation.

For the past 6 months, she had been homeschooled by her parents due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. She was an active child, but her activities were restricted to home due to the pandemic. Her parents experienced signs and symptoms akin to a mild upper respiratory tract infection a week prior. She recently received outpatient care involving oral antibiotics and intravenous serum. She was admitted to the surgery service of Akbar Hospital with fever and abdominal pain, suspecting appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting persisted. Following normal sonography findings and the emergence of new symptoms including rash and conjunctivitis, she was referred to the pediatric COVID-19 ward. Absence of cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea was noted. She was administered co-trimoxazole and ondansetron from the third day. Physical examination revealed bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, erythematous throat, palmar erythema, strawberry tongue, and erythema multiform rash without hypotension. There was no lymphadenopathy or retraction breathing, with normal respiratory sounds. Infection was not localized. A cardiac examination revealed an II/VI murmur on the left sternal border. Given the pandemic state of COVID-19 and her fever (38.6 \u00b0C), a lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed, which showed no signs of COVID-19 infection. Laboratory evaluation included urinalysis with urine culture, and all results were negative. Laboratory examination indicated ESR was 67 mm/h, CRP 166 mg/L, platelets 192 \u00d7 10^9/L, hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL and WBC 10.3\u00d710^9/L (PMN: 82%). Other routine biochemistry and liver function tests yielded normal findings. On a different note, an MRI scan showed signs of abnormal white matter in her brain, a symptom associated with Krabbe disease. She received IVIG (2 g/kg; 1 g/kg on two consecutive days) and high-dose acetylsalicylic acid (20 mg/kg four times daily) according to a rheumatology consultation. Echocardiography showed no pathology related to coronary arteries. Furthermore, respiratory tract viral infections were evaluated by RT-PCR test for COVID-19 and blood culture, all with negative results. The patient had not traveled recently. However, her parents had flu-like symptoms and reported loss of taste and smell. She was hospitalized for 5 days and the day before discharge, serologic tests for COVID-19 infection in her parents (serum IgM more than 1.1) and the child herself became positive (serum IgM COVID-19 of 2.1). Consequently, the public health department was notified, and the family was advised to quarantine at home for 14 days from the date of the positive test result.",

He was treated with immunomodulators including an initial treatment of azathioprine 50 mg and prednisolone 15 mg twice daily, and mesalazine. Owing to remission of the clinical symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease, prednisolone was gradually tapered off; prednisone use covered a total period of 3 months. Following 4 months of azathioprine and 3 months of prednisolone use, the patient complained of persistent abdominal pain and diarrhea. Endoscopy in March 2019 revealed scarring in the colon and terminal ileum. Furthermore, inflammatory polypoid lesions were noted in the terminal ileum that were not present in a previous examination . Results of a biopsy revealed that spindle cells were arranged in intersecting fascicles with intervening slit-like vascular spaces containing erythrocytes located in the submucosal layer. Immunohistochemistry revealed immunoreactivity for CD34, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and HHV-8. Stainings for CD117, DOG1, and cytomegalovirus were all negative .

He had been hospitalized for 1 month at a public hospital in Natal, Brazil, with initial symptoms of intense diarrhea, daily fevers, sweating, and chills for 3 weeks. He was diagnosed with disseminated TB, and tuberculostatic treatment (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide) was given for 10 days. However, due to increased transaminase levels, his regimen was changed to levofloxacin, capreomycin, and ethambutol. He was observed for 10 days and discharged. Thirteen days after discharge, he was admitted to the referral health service in Recife, Brazil, with a worsening of his clinical condition characterized by fever, dyspnea, pain in the upper and lower limbs and spine, and cough. Prophylactic treatment with sulfamethoxazole\u2009+\u2009trimethoprim + piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated. Lymphocyte counts showed that patient was severely immunocompromised, with a CD4 count of 8 cells/mL, CD8 count of 347 cells/mL, and CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.02. A high viral load was detected (174,034 copies). Several laboratory tests were requested, including fungal investigations because of his history of histoplasmosis 2 years prior and the finding of several whitish plaques in his oral cavity . Blood culture, bronchoalveolar lavage, and oral secretions were obtained. The samples were sent to the Laboratory of Diagnostic in Tropical Diseases at the Federal University of Pernambuco, and slides were made for direct examination (Fig. 1b, c) to visualize fungal structures.

The patient also described experiencing dyspnea when lying down, nocturnal sweating, and a slight loss of appetite over the previous month. However, she had no gastrointestinal issues. She had been diagnosed with UC at the age of 29 years, characterized by bloody diarrhea. Her condition had been in remission for over 35 years, and she was taking salazosulfapyridine (1000\u20131500 mg/day) orally. She had no occupational dust exposure history, but her family had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. \n\nUpon physical examination, her vital signs were noted as follows: temperature, 36.4 \u00b0C; heart rate, 99 beats per minute; blood pressure, 136/74 mmHg; respiratory rate, 16 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation on room air, 98%. Auscultation of the neck and chest revealed normal breath sounds, without any abnormal sounds. The remainder of the physical examination, including the outer ear, nose, and joints, was normal. \n\nBlood analysis revealed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 10.71 mg/dL) and increased levels of leucine-rich \u03b1-2-glycoprotein (LRG; 44.2 \u03bcg/mL, normal < 16.0 \u03bcg/mL), a new biomarker for evaluating disease activity in patients with UC. Tumor markers, proteinase-3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were within normal limits. Moreover, T-SPOT.TB (an interferon-\u03b3 release assay) was negative. \n\nChest radiography revealed narrowing of the trachea compared with the previous year, and chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated circumferential thickening of the tracheal wall, ranging from the trachea to the bilateral main bronchi, without any lung parenchymal abnormalities. Pulmonary function tests showed a forced vital capacity of 2.81 L [114.5% of the predicted volume (pred)], forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 2.06 L (101.5% pred), and decreased peak expiratory flow of 3.11 L per second (53.3% pred). \n\nHer symptoms did not respond to treatment with oral levofloxacin (500 mg/day) or inhaled fluticasone furoate (100 \u03bcg/day)/vilanterol trifenatate (25 \u03bcg/day) administered for 1 week. \n\nUpon performing a bronchoscopy to investigate the extensive large airway disease, widespread edema with erythema and diffuse concentric narrowing of the bronchial lumen from the trachea to the bilateral segmental bronchi was noted. However, neither swelling nor paralysis of the vocal cord was confirmed. Dynamic collapse of the central airway was not observed during respiration. Mucosal biopsy specimens exhibited marked submucosal lymphocytic infiltration. \n\nIt is noteworthy that a significant finding was a slightly elevated level of streptococcus pyogenes found in the throat swab culture, which is commonly associated with acute laryngitis and tracheitis. No evidence of infection, malignancy, vasculitis, or amyloidosis was found. \n\nTherefore, given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, a preliminary diagnosis of acute laryngitis and tracheitis was considered, although the true diagnosis was UC-related tracheobronchitis.",

She had been put on abacavir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir 3 weeks before, as a routine switch from a TDF-based regimen. She had previously been on a regimen of TDF, 3TC, and efavirenz but had it changed because of the availability of a new formulation of ABC, 3TC, and DTG (Triumeq) that was deemed better by her primary physician. She reported a dry cough, sore throat, chest discomfort, and myalgia. She also reported a history of vomiting 3 days before the hospital visit. She was subject to fever and chills, was anorexic and nauseous. She also complained of occasional headaches, without neck stiffness or photophobia. She had been tested for malaria a couple of times a few days prior, but was persistently negative. At presentation, her blood pressure was 142/84 mmHg, heart rate 102 beats per minute, with temperature 36.1 \u00b0C and oxygen saturation at 94% on ambient air. On examination, she had an inflamed throat and posterior palate with tender tonsils to palpation, her chest was clear and the cardiovascular system examination was otherwise unremarkable. She also had tenderness to palpation of the limb muscles without evidence of arthritis. Remarkably, she had a white cell count of 2.6 \u00d7 10^9/L (73% granulocytes, 22% lymphocytes), hemoglobin of 14.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 122 \u00d7 10^9/L, but her kidney function tests were within normal. The rest of the laboratory results are outlined in Additional file 1: Table S1. She was admitted for intravenous rehydration and bed rest, with a presumption of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, the sore throat persisted despite the initial relief. On the second day of admission, she complained of generalized body ache. Laboratory results showed a significant increase in liver enzymes, thus prompting testing for viral hepatitis and repeat testing for malaria, which turned positive, and she was subsequently started on artesunate. The patient was advised to suspend her ART given the liver impairments. She responded well to treatment and the transaminases started to improve, although she kept complaining of myalgias and progressive body swelling with paresthesia in the lower limbs. She was discharged on the seventh day feeling better. She was, however, readmitted a day after discharge (ninth day since the first admission) complaining of an episode of severe headache followed by profuse sweating. She denied fever but reported that she had vomited six times that day and had three episodes of diarrhea with burning lower abdominal pains. Her blood pressure was 87/50 mmHg, heart rate 130 beats per minute, temperature 35.4 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 88%. Apart from a tender epigastrium, systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable. She was started on rabeprazole, antibiotics to cover hospital acquired infection, and ondansetron. Unfortunately, cultures were not taken. She was also started on Ringer\u2019s lactate. Significantly, her laboratory results showed features of acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine of 183 \u00b5mol/L. On the second day of this admission, she developed a rash in the extremities that spread to the trunk, she was started on cetirizine and mometasone cream. As her blood pressure improved, the kidney function improved. In addition, there was a notable improvement in the liver transaminases compared with previous tests. The rash also improved. She was discharged after 5 days (13 days after the initial admission). However, the patient was readmitted the night of the day of discharge, in a hysterical state with burning chest pain and chills. Her blood pressure was 108/67 mmHg, heart rate 153 beats per minute, temperature 34.2 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation at 92% on room air. Systemic examination was unremarkable. There was no notable rash at this time. A bedside electrocardiogram was unremarkable apart from the extreme tachycardia and an arterial blood gas report consistent with respiratory alkalosis with lactate of 4.3 mmol/L. However, there was a highly elevated serum level of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium. On further interrogation, the patient revealed that she had taken the ABC-containing tablets shortly before she became unwell and she had vomited a while after that. It was also noted that the patient had been restarting her ART every time she was discharged, contrary to advice. The patient was managed supportively and showed marked improvement, although she still had peripheral neuropathy of the left lower limb requiring physiotherapy and the use of a crutch. On clinical suspicion, an HLA-B*57:01 test was requested. This proved positive and the patient was advised to completely stop the ABC/DTG/3TC regimen. She was discharged after a 2-day stay at the hospital. On follow-up, she did well. She presented 12 days later (27 days after the initial presentation) with severe headaches and episodes of confusion. A brain computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a left posterior parietal tuberculoma. She was started on rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, and then rifampicin and isoniazid for 16 months (this was occasioned by persistent symptoms at 12 months and persistent but shrinking tuberculoma). She received a short course of dexamethasone at the beginning of this treatment. Two months after the initial presentation, her ART regimen was changed to a two-tablet regime consisting of DTG and a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine plus TDF. This was occasioned by a rise in the HIV viral load with stable liver and kidney function test results while on antituberculous therapy. She made tremendous improvement overall, although she has persistent headaches 24 months after the first episode. The most recent CD4 count is 512 cells/\u00b5L and viral load is 22 copies/mL. The timeline of events is summarized in Fig. 1.",

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Chinese man who suffered from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm underwent craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation. No problems with swallowing or speaking were reported during the surgery. Unfortunately, the patient experienced dysarthria, dysphagia, and trouble with tongue movement after the surgery. Thus, we performed a detailed neurological examination. In addition to the symptoms described above, we also found symptoms linked to cranial nerve injuries, such as a weakened pharyngeal reflex, tongue deviation toward the affected side, atrophy of tongue muscle, and so on. Further evaluations and imaging examinations were carried out. The rating of the functional oral intake scale (FOIS) was level 2. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) showed that the contrast agent leaked into the vestibule of the larynx and entered the trachea through the glottis when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid . The rating of Rosenbek leakage/aspiration scale was level 8, which is the worst level. When the patient drank 3 ml of medium-thick semi-fluid liquid, effective swallowing was not initiated and the epiglottis valley had a large amount of residue. When examined through the electronic laryngoscope, we noticed paralysis of bilateral vocal folds . All these observations indicated that the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve had been injured. Therefore, we thought that there may be a lesion in or near the brainstem that led to nerve injury. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that there were no brainstem lesions , and that the symptoms that arose after surgery could not be explained by the left frontal lobe malacia and subdural hematoma . Owing to the inconformity of symptoms and radiographic results, we decided to analyze the rare case again. When we reviewed the clinical history, we noticed that the surgery was performed under general anesthesia and transoral intubation, so there may be a connection between transoral intubation and nerve injury. After consulting with the ear\u2013nose\u2013throat (ENT) and anesthesiology departments, we excluded arytenoid dislocation and violent intubation. Then we found that these symptoms are similar to those of a specific syndrome, so we compared the characteristics of this case with diagnostic criteria of that syndrome. First, in terms of clinical history, the majority of cases occur following the surgical intervention under general anesthesia and transoral intubation. Our patient went through craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation before these symptoms arose. Second, symptoms of the patient included difficulties in tongue movement, unilateral tongue paralysis, and atrophy of the tongue, as well as hoarseness and dysphagia, which matches the described symptoms of that syndrome. Third, the complete neurological examination showed that there are cranial nerve injuries and, based on the MRI results, we excluded lesions in the brainstem. Hence the symptoms are likely caused by peripheral nerve injuries. Thus, a diagnosis was made. Fig. 1 Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). A Aspiration occurred when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid. (before treatment, arrow, left). B A small amount of leakage when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid.

B Symptoms cannot be explained by left frontal lobe malacia and subdural hematoma (arrow, right) Full size image We designed a detailed rehabilitation strategy for the patient immediately. In the previous studies of that syndrome, only standard swallowing training was used as rehabilitation treatment, which proved to be effective but still means a lengthy recovery process. So we decided to include electroacupuncture as a measure in our treatment to observe the effect. The patient received acupuncture treatment 30 minutes per day, six times per week for 52 days . Qi She brand disposable, sterile steel needles (0.25\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm; Wuxi Jiajian Medical Instrument Co. Ltd) were used. Based on our experience in treating similar diseases, we chose several acupoints to improve deglutition and speech function. These acupoints included the three-needle tongue (Shanglianquan, located in the depression between the lingual bone and the border of the lower jaw, 1 cun inferior to the midline of the jaw), and two other acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (note that the width of the interphalangeal joint of the patient\u2019s thumb is taken as 1 cun, approximately 25 mm), Dicang (ST 4, with the eyes looking straight forward, the point is vertically below the pupil, at the level of the angle of the mouth), Taixi (KI 3, in the depression between the tip of the medial malleolus and Achilles\u2019 tendon), and Zhaohai (KI 6, in the depression below the tip of the medial malleolus). Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation (EA parameters were set as follows: discontinuous wave with frequency 5 Hz, pulse width 1 ms, and intensity approximately 2 mA, until a slight jitter in the muscle is observed) was applied to two acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (EX). No side effects such as bleeding or hematoma were observed during the entire treatment. Fig. 4 The location of acupoints. Acupoints on face and neck (three-needle tongue and Dicang).

    "rewritten_case": "A Chinese male patient of 57 years old was brought to our attention due to complications following a craniotomy evacuation of hematoma carried out after a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, caused by the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm. The operation had been performed under general anesthesia with transoral intubation. Interestingly, no issues with swallowing or speech were reported during the procedure. \n\nIn the period after the operation, however, the patient exhibited dysphagia, dysarthria, and difficulties with tongue movement. This led us to carry out a comprehensive neurological examination. Besides the symptoms already mentioned, we identified signs of cranial nerve injuries, including a weakened pharyngeal reflex, tongue deviation toward the affected side, and atrophy of the tongue muscle.\n\nGiven these observations, we carried out additional evaluations and imaging examinations. The functional oral intake scale (FOIS) rated at level 2. A Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) showed that when the patient ingested 3 ml of thin liquid, the contrast agent leaked into the vestibule of the larynx and entered the trachea through the glottis. The Rosenbek leakage/aspiration scale showed a level 8, the worst possible rating, when the patient ingested 3 ml of medium-thick semi-fluid liquid. An examination through the electronic laryngoscope revealed paralysis of bilateral vocal folds. \n\nGiven these findings, we deduced injuries to the vagus and hypoglossal nerves. We initially speculated that there might be a lesion in or near the brainstem that could have led to these nerve injuries. However, an MRI revealed no such lesions, and the symptoms that had surfaced after surgery could not be explained by the left frontal lobe malacia and subdural hematoma. \n\nDue to this discrepancy, we re-analyzed the case and considered the fact that the surgery was performed under general anesthesia with transoral intubation. Consultation with the ear\u2013nose\u2013throat (ENT) and anesthesiology departments ruled out arytenoid dislocation and violent intubation. We noted that the symptoms matched those of a specific syndrome, leading us to compare the case characteristics with the diagnostic criteria for this syndrome.\n\nFirstly, the majority of cases of this syndrome occur following surgical intervention under general anesthesia and transoral intubation, which matches our patient\u2019s history. Secondly, the patient's symptoms, including difficulties in tongue movement, unilateral tongue paralysis, atrophy of the tongue, hoarseness and dysphagia, matched the described symptoms of the syndrome. Thirdly, the comprehensive neurological examination and MRI results led us to exclude lesions in the brainstem, suggesting the symptoms were likely caused by peripheral nerve injuries.\n\nConsequently, we embarked on a rehabilitation strategy that included electroacupuncture, which was administered for 30 minutes a day, six days a week, using Qi She brand disposable, sterile steel needles.

    "original_case": "A 68-year-old Japanese man was found to have an extensive type 0\u2013IIc lesion in the upper gastric body extending up to the hypogastric lesser curvature on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in September 2019. Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; the patient was referred to our department for surgery. He had hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, he had no family history of malignancy. The patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, D1+\u2009lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction in November 2019. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged 6\u00a0days postoperatively. The initial surgical specimen findings were as follows : a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200935-mm 0\u2013IIc lesion with shallow depression ranging from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature. Histopathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins that were staged IA (pT1aN0M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors, 8th edition. Fig. 1 First surgical specimen. The arrows show the tumor.\u00a0Lesion with shallow depression extending from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature Full size image The patient was followed-up without adjuvant chemotherapy; however, a 38\u2009\u00d7\u200936\u00a0mm soft tissue mass was noted on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach during computed tomography (CT) 2\u00a0years after the procedure. Although partial thickening of the gastric wall was seen retrospectively in a 1-year postoperative CT scan, it was reviewed within normal limits by a radiologist at that time . No evidence of recurrent metastasis was found at other sites. Fig. 2 One\u00a0year postoperatively (a), 2\u00a0years postoperatively (b). The soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach is enlarged.\u00a0The arrows show the soft tissue mass Full size image The blood test findings were as follows: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 1.8\u00a0ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), 8.5 U/mL; and soluble IL-2 receptor, 396 U/mL. Colonoscopy had been performed prior to the first surgery; hence, it was not performed again. The FDG-PET/CT findings were as follows : The soft tissue mass on the left side of the residual stomach showed moderate FDG accumulation (SUVmax, 5.25). No FDG accumulation was observed in other areas. Malignant lesions, including recurrent gastric cancer and regional lymph node metastasis, were suspected; however, qualitative diagnosis was difficult. No abnormal accumulation indicating recurrence and metastasis occurred at other sites. Fig. 3 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography. The soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach shows FDG accumulation (SUVmax 5.25). The arrows show the soft tissue mass. FDG fluorodeoxyglucose Full size image Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed the following findings : the soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach exhibited a high, heterogenous signal on T2-weighted images and a low signal on T1-weighted images, and contrast imaging revealed a slow contrast effect. Other malignant lesions such as gastric cancer recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) were considered as possible differential diagnoses; however, none of the findings were typical, and qualitative diagnosis was difficult. Fig. 4 Magnetic resonance imaging. T2-weighted image showing a heterogeneous high signal.\u00a0The arrows show the soft tissue mass Full size image Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic findings were as follows : no mass lesions were present in the remnant stomach. Transgastric ultrasonography revealed a 43\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u00a0mm borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum, which was biopsied using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Fig. 5 Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. A borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum Full size image The biopsy results were as follows: the tumor contained multiple spindle-shaped cells, and immunostaining for CD34, c-kit, desmin, S-100, and \u03b2-catenin was performed to distinguish spindle-shaped tumors; however, no significant positive findings were obtained. The biopsy specimen did not allow us to estimate the histological type of the tumor as it did not conclusively suggest a GIST, smooth myxoid, or schwannoma. Based on the above-mentioned examination results, local recurrence of gastric cancer, lymph node metastasis, a GIST, a smooth myxoid, and a schwannoma were regarded as possible differential diagnoses. Although the possibility of a benign tumor remained, a definitive diagnosis could not be made histopathologically, and moderate FDG accumulation could not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, we decided to operate for diagnostic treatment. Preoperative CT revealed a suspicious finding of splenic arteriovenous invasion; therefore, total residual gastrectomy and splenectomy were planned. The surgical findings were as follows: the abdomen was opened via a median upper abdominal incision. A 50\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u00a0mm soft tissue mass originating from the gastrojejunal anastomosis involving the spleen and splenic arteriovenous was observed on the greater curvature side of the anastomosis. Additionally, a partial invasion of the pancreas was observed. The remaining stomach, spleen, splenic artery and vein, and part of the pancreas, including the gastrojejunal anastomosis, along with the soft tissue mass, were removed as a single lump. Regarding reconstruction, only esophago-jejunal anastomosis was performed, sparing previous jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. The operation time was 279\u00a0minutes, and blood loss was 1100\u00a0mL; however, no blood transfusion was required. Pathological findings of the resected specimen were as follows : a 45\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200940-mm soft tissue mass extending from the muscularis propria to the serosa at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The tumor was a white, substantial nodule, and its growth involved the gastrojejunal anastomosis.

    "rewritten_case": "A 68-year-old Japanese man underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy due to an unrelated health issue. The procedure revealed an extensive type 0-IIc lesion in the upper gastric body extending up to the hypogastric lesser curvature. A biopsy of this lesion indicated a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient was referred to our department for surgery. He had a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but no family history of malignancy.\n\nThe patient underwent a robot-assisted laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, D1+ lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The postoperative period was uneventful, and he was discharged six days after the surgery. The initial surgical specimen was a 50 x 35-mm 0-IIc lesion with shallow depression ranging from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature. Histopathological examination revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative resection margins that were staged IA (pT1aN0M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors, 8th edition.\n\nThe patient was followed-up without adjuvant chemotherapy. However, during a routine checkup, a 38 x 36 mm soft tissue mass was noted on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach during a CT scan. In retrospect, partial thickening of the gastric wall was observed on a previous CT scan, but it was reviewed within normal limits by a radiologist at that time. No evidence of recurrent metastasis was found at other sites.\n\nBlood test findings were as follows: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 1.8 ng/mL; carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), 8.5 U/mL; and soluble IL-2 receptor, 396 U/mL. The FDG-PET/CT findings indicated that the soft tissue mass on the left side of the residual stomach showed moderate FDG accumulation (SUVmax, 5.25). No FDG accumulation was observed in other areas.\n\nContrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen revealed a high, heterogenous signal on T2-weighted images and a low signal on T1-weighted images for the soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach. Slow contrast effect was observed on contrast imaging. Despite these findings, qualitative diagnosis was difficult to establish.\n\nAn upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no mass lesions in the remnant stomach. However, transgastric ultrasonography revealed a 43 x 30 mm borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum. This was biopsied using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).\n\nThe biopsy results showed that the tumor contained multiple spindle-shaped cells. Immunostaining for CD34, c-kit, desmin, S-100, and \u03b2-catenin was performed, but no significant positive findings were obtained. The histological type of the tumor could not be conclusively determined, thus rendering a definitive diagnosis impossible.\n\nPreoperative CT revealed a suspicious finding of splenic arteriovenous invasion. Therefore, total residual gastrectomy and splenectomy were planned. The operation revealed a 50 x 40 mm soft tissue mass originating from the gastrojejunal anastomosis involving the spleen and splenic arteriovenous on the greater curvature side of the anastomosis. A partial invasion of the pancreas was also observed.\n\nThe operation was completed without any complications, and pathologic findings of the resected specimen were noted. A 45 x 40 x 40-mm soft tissue mass extending from the muscularis propria to the serosa at the gastrojejunal anastomosis was observed. The tumor was a white, substantial nodule, and its growth involved the gastrojejunal anastomosis. Although fib",

    "original_case": "A 29-year-old white male was transported to the emergency department by ambulance after experiencing a seizure in the early morning hours in September 2018. He had experienced mild pain in his left leg 1 day earlier, but did not experience any shortness of breath or chest pain at this time. Past medical history included minor mitral valve prolapse diagnosed in adolescence and at age 18 years a left tibial tubercle fracture. The patient was a commercial airline pilot and reported an average of 18 days or 90 hour per month spent piloting. He was living in a high-altitude city at the time of symptom presentation. Family history included a cousin with epilepsy and was otherwise non-contributory. The patient was discharged after an unremarkable head computed tomography (CT) scan and was referred to neurology. Neurology ruled out epilepsy as the cause of his seizures. Additional work-up, including electroencephalogram (EEG), was within normal limits. One week after his first seizure and subsequent neurology consult, the patient presented at urgent care with left leg pain and exertional shortness of breath. No imaging or bloodwork was ordered at this time. He was discharged with an erroneous diagnosis of allergies. Later in the same month, he experienced his second seizure, again in the early morning hours, but did not seek emergent medical care. Upon a second evaluation by the neurologist, he was prescribed levetiracetam. In November 2018, the patient presented to the emergency department with 3-day history of shortness of breath, hemoptysis, left calf pain radiating to the popliteal area, and intermittent left midsternal chest pain. The patient underwent an extended period of automobile travel of approximately 20 hour duration 2 weeks prior. The patient\u2019s vitals were BP 145/88, MAP 107 mmHg, temperature 97.8 \u00b0F, HR 93, RR 16, and SaO2 of 95% on RA. Upon physical examination, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no diminished breath sounds. Cardiac auscultation revealed no gallops or murmurs. Radial and femoral pulses were normal bilaterally. No edema was found in the extremities. The neurological examination was within normal limits. Blood work and imaging were subsequently ordered. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm and a rate of 98 bpm. D-dimer was elevated, which prompted further testing. Chest CT chest with intravenous (IV) contrast showed extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism . Clot burden was identified in left and right interlobar arteries extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches without infarction or effusion. IV tPA was administered. A 4-mm lingular nodule was found on CT, and oncological work-up was recommended. Fig. 1 (Left) an axial slice from a CT of the chest obtained during the pulmonary angiographic phase of IV contrast administration demonstrates the largest site of PE in the patient, located in the left proximal interlobar pulmonary artery. (Right) a coronal view demonstrating PE located in the left proximal interlobar pulmonary artery Full size image At this time, the differential diagnosis was still broad. Trousseau\u2019s syndrome was on the differential but was ruled out. Oncologic work-up was negative for malignancy. Laboratory values were within normal limits. The patient had not experienced another seizure. Work-up included full-body CT scan, which revealed findings . Hematological profile was also within normal limits, and the findings were postulated to be the cause of the patient\u2019s clotting and was added to the differential for the underlying cause of his symptom profile. Treatment options were discussed including long-term anticoagulation therapy as a minimally invasive option and venoplasty as an invasive option. The patient wished to proceed with the more definitive option and elected to undergo endovascular venoplasty with stent placement. In March 2019, Interventional Radiology placed bilateral common iliac and right external iliac venous stents to attempt definitive treatment. Stents were placed bilaterally after Doppler flow analysis showed diminished blood flow in both left and right internal iliac veins. Post-catheterization CT with three-dimensional (3D) rendering showed placement position of and patent luminary blood flow through the stents (Figs. 3, 4). Fig. 2 CT scans in all planes with 3D rendering demonstrate severe compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. 3D rendering demonstrates associated changes of the vein underlying the artery Full size image Fig. 3 Intraoperative venograms show ballooning (left), stent deployment (middle), and completion of deployment (right).

It was deemed safe to discontinue heparin and switch to daily aspirin 4 weeks after venoplasty. Six days after discontinuation of heparin, the patient experienced another thrombotic event presenting with left leg pain and shortness of breath. Diagnostic workup, including CT, was significant for PE, and the patient was taken to the interventional radiology suite. The right popliteal vein was accessed in an integrated fashion using a six French vascular sheath. A venogram was performed. A guidewire and catheter were advanced into the common femoral veins bilaterally, and simultaneous iliac venograms were performed. Catheters were then advanced bilaterally into the common iliac stents, and IV contrast was injected. Significant thrombus was demonstrated within the right proximal external iliac vein and bilateral stented common iliac veins. The thrombus also extended proximally into the inferior vena cava (IVC) immediately above the stents as well as distally into the left femoral and popliteal veins . Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy was then performed through each access site, from the left popliteal vein through the left iliac veins and into the IVC, and also from the right external iliac vein into the IVC. Fig. 5 Venography 5 weeks post-stent placement shows stents in place complicated by severe intrastent and intravenous thrombosis extending into the inferior vena cava Full size image Following thrombectomy, 20 cm infusion length catheters were deployed bilaterally. tPA infusion was initiated through each infusion catheter. In addition, to treat the nonocclusive thrombus within the distal left femoral and popliteal veins, tPA was also infused through the access sheath at that site. All sheaths and catheters were secured to the skin, and weight-based heparin was continued. Twenty-four hours later, the patient underwent fluoroscopy which confirmed patency of the treated segments . The patient remained inpatient for monitoring for the next 24 h and was discharged home on apixaban for chemoprophylaxis. The patient tolerated the procedure without complication. Fig. 6 Venography shows patent flow 24 hours after inpatient pharmacomechanical thrombectomy Full size image The patient has since reported no additional seizures, clotting events, or emergency department visits. No other significant disorders have been found, including testing for Factor V Leiden, cancer, thyroid disorders, and patent foramen ovale.

    "original_case": "The patient gave her written consent to the anonymous description and publication of her case report. We present the case of an 84-year-old Caucasian woman suffering from severe pain of the left flank of several weeks\u2019 duration. Prior to the patient\u2019s current hospitalization, as reported here, a decompression and stabilization of the lumbar and thoracic spine had been performed 2 months before in a different neurosurgical clinic. In view of the clinical results and continuing severe pain, an extension of the preexisting spinal fusion from the 4th lumbar vertebral body to the second sacral vertebral body, including a cage implantation, was recommended. The patient presented multiple preexisting conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, diabetic polyneuropathy, moderate valvular aortic stenosis, and restless legs syndrome. Further, the patient introduced herself as a member of the community of JWs. For this reason, she was transferred to the local department of anesthesiology to discuss blood-saving techniques as well as the risks accompanying the procedure, as she was not willing to receive any form of blood transfusion. After the patient\u2019s decision to undergo spinal fusion surgery, an interdisciplinary plan based on the three pillars of PBM was made to provide maximum security for the patient\u2019s outcome. Presurgical assessment Prior to surgery, the patient signed an informed consent document and was asked to decide which types of blood products would be compatible with her beliefs (Additional file 1: Table S1). Initially, the patient\u2019s hemoglobin (Hb) level was 11.5 g/dl, which could be raised to 12.6 g/dl for the day of surgery by substituting iron-II-glycin-sulfate (100 mg/d). Additionally, blood sampling was reduced to a minimum, and the surgical procedure was thoroughly and interdisciplinarily planned. Alongside with cell savage techniques, anesthetic management focused on the third pillar of PBM, aiming for cardiopulmonary optimization by using a machine learning monitoring tool and a hemodynamic goal-directed therapy (GDT) protocol. The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) was established by Edwards Lifesciences (Irvine, California, USA) and is certified in the United States and Europe for hemodynamic monitoring. It aims to predict phases of intraoperative hypotension (IOH, defined as MAP < 65 mmHg for at least one minute) up to 15 min before their onset. The scale ranges from 0 to 100%, indicating the likelihood of and remaining time to pending IOH. Our hypothesis was that unnecessary volume expansion could be avoided by using the HPI-based GDT because additional fluids would only be given when the patient would be volume responsive and simultaneously be at risk for IOH. This approach should therefore prevent unnecessary hemodilution. Induction of anesthesia, hemodynamic, and intraoperative management The patient received a standard induction of anesthesia using sufentanil (0.52 \u03bcg/kg), propofol (1.67 mg/kg), and cis-Atracurium (0.21 mg/kg). The maintenance of anesthesia was performed as total intravenous anesthesia using propofol (6\u201312 mg/kg/h) as continuous infusion and sufentanil (0.1\u20130.3 \u03bcg/kg) as intermittent bolus injection. The total duration of surgery was 425 min. To compensate for blood loss, a mechanical autotransfusion system (CellSaver\u00ae, Haemonetics Corporation, Boston, USA) was used during the whole course of surgery. For hemodynamic management, an HPI-based GDT-algorithm was used . Since unnecessary hemodilution, also in GDT-treated patients, would lead to an unfavorable outcome, especially in the presented patient, we chose a more fluid-restrictive GDT. First, before the induction of anesthesia, the baseline cardiac index (CI) as well as the stroke volume were determined by implementing an arterial line in the awake patient. If HPI was raised over 70%, hemodynamic intervention was performed according to the algorithm. More specifically, if stroke volume variation (SVV) increased over 14%, a colloid bolus injection using 100 ml of gelatin infusion (Gelafundine\u00ae, B. Braun Germany) was applied over 5 min. If HPI did not decrease, the injection was repeated until HPI declined < 80% or SVV < 14%, whichever occurred first. If HPI persistently leveled > 80% despite a successful fluid challenge (defined as SVV < 14%), CI was raised when it was below the baseline value with dobutamine (5 \u03bcg/kg/min, half dose if heart rate was raised > 100 bpm). If still no reduction of HPI could be achieved after successful fluid challenge and CI optimization, noradrenaline or theodrenaline/cafedrine (Akrinor\u00ae) was used to maintain a MAP > 70 mmHg. Fig. 1 Hypotension Prediction Index-based hemodynamic treatment algorithm. CI: Cardiac Index; HPI: Hypotension Prediction Index; MAP: Mean Arterial Pressure; SVV: Stroke Volume Variation Full size image By adhering to the GDT algorithm, a sufficient hemodynamic stability was achieved throughout the surgery. The patient received a total of 2500 ml colloid infusion, maximum rates of 0.13 \u00b5g/kg/min of noradrenaline, 0.5 ml of theodrenaline/cafedrine, and no further cardiac support medication. The patient never showed signs of low pH or negative BE despite a blood loss of 2.4 L (). It was possible to reinfuse 1007 ml of the patient\u2019s own blood that was saved by the autotransfusion system. To prevent hypofibrinolytic bleeding, tranexamic acid was infused intraoperatively, starting with a bolus of 20 mg/kg/h for 1 hour and continuing with an infusion of 4 mg/kg/h for the remaining time of surgery. Once bleeding started to intensify, point-of-care thrombelastography (ROTEM\u00ae, TEM Innovations, Munich, Germany) was used to detect coagulatory alterations, which resulted in the substitution of 3 g fibrinogen.

Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.41, pO2 of 57 mmHg, pCO2 of 28 mmHg, total bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, and lactate of 0.6 mmol/L. On chest X-ray examination, bilateral infiltrates predominated in the basal part of both lungs . Lung computed tomography (CT) disclosed bilateral ground-glass opacities and septal thickening . Empirical antimicrobial therapy was started with piperacillin/tazobactam and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Antihypertensive medications and flecainide were withdrawn. Because of the rapidly progressive hypoxemia, oral intubation was required for mechanical ventilation with inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) 0.80. Before antimicrobial therapy, a sputum analysis from the endotracheal aspirate failed to reveal any microorganism on direct examination, and culture remained sterile. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was also temporarily needed. Examination and cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; 73% neutrophils, 16% macrophages) were negative for mycobacteria (including atypical), bacteria, fungi, parasites and virus (multiplex PCR respiratory panel). In the serum, PCR was negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and the Aspergillus galactomannan test was negative. Immunofluorescent staining and PCR were negative on BAL. Screening for myositis-specific antibodies (and also other autoimmune disorders) was negative. Echocardiography confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic valve disease, with preserved left ventricle ejection fraction, but with a moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. An open lung biopsy was performed on intensive care unit (ICU) day 4. Intravenous methylprednisolone was started (80 mg, corresponding to 1.25 mg/kg) for 11 days, and was then shifted to 64 mg prednisolone orally. Antimicrobial therapy was definitely stopped on ICU day 6. Microscopic examination revealed a diffuse filling of alveolar spaces by fibrin balls . Culture of lung tissue remained sterile. Genotyping for cytochrome P450 2D6 was also performed and the patient was *2/*4 with a duplication for *4.

A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates primarily in the basal part of both lungs. Lung computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and septal thickening. Based on the clinical presentation and these findings, a preliminary diagnosis of pneumonia was considered. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Antihypertensive medications and flecainide were discontinued. Due to rapidly worsening hypoxemia, she required oral intubation for mechanical ventilation with an inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) of 0.80. Despite antimicrobial therapy, a sputum analysis from the endotracheal aspirate did not reveal any microorganisms, and culture remained sterile. Temporary continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was required. Examination and cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL; 73% neutrophils, 16% macrophages) were negative for mycobacteria (including atypical), bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (multiplex PCR respiratory panel). In the serum, PCR was negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and the Aspergillus galactomannan test was negative. Immunofluorescent staining and PCR were negative on BAL. Screening for myositis-specific antibodies (and other autoimmune disorders) was negative. Echocardiography confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic valve disease, with preserved left ventricle ejection fraction, but with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. A lung biopsy was performed on intensive care unit (ICU) day 4. Intravenous methylprednisolone was started (80 mg, corresponding to 1.25 mg/kg) for 11 days, and was then shifted to 64 mg prednisolone orally. Antimicrobial therapy was stopped on ICU day 6. Microscopic examination revealed a diffuse filling of alveolar spaces by fibrin balls. Culture of lung tissue remained sterile. Genotyping for cytochrome P450 2D6 denoted the patient as an intermediate metabolizer for flecainide. She was successfully extubated on ICU day",

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old nulliparous Japanese woman visited our clinic for the first time, presenting with dull left lower abdominal pain lasting for a few weeks. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) showed a left unilocular ovarian cystic mass, measuring 60 mm, containing a solid component on the cul-de-sac of Douglas . The patient was referred to the Department of Gynecology, Nara Medical University Hospital in September 2020 for the diagnosis of ovarian tumor. The patient was a housewife with normal social, emotional, and cognitive development and had normal environmental and employment history. There was no past medical, surgical, and medication history. She had never smoked or consumed alcohol. Neurological examinations were unremarkable. Evaluation of the patient\u2019s family history revealed that her father died of lung cancer, all three of her paternal uncles succumbed to colon cancer, two paternal aunts died of gastric cancer and colon cancer, respectively, and one maternal uncle was treated for leukemia. In addition, her paternal grandfather died of gastric cancer. All three of her brothers are fine. Vital signs on admission showed a body temperature of 36.3 \u00b0C, blood pressure of 132/74 mm\u200aHg, and respiratory rate of 20/minute. She was obese (weight\u200979 kg, height\u2009158 cm, body mass index\u200931.6 kg/m\u00b2). A pelvic mass was palpated on the left side of the uterus during physical examination. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 57\u2009\u00d7\u200941\u2009\u00d7\u200939 mm cystic mass with solid component originating in the left adnexa. The cystic part is of liquid signal, the solid component had high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and had low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), with hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) . In addition, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan revealed increased FDG uptake in solid components of the tumor [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax): 19.9] . No distant metastases were detected with staging CT and FDG-PET/CT. The patient had elevated serum levels of cancer antigen (CA) 125 (89 U/mL), but CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within the normal range. Imaging studies suspected ovarian malignancy, and she received primary debulking surgery. Following surgery, the pathological evaluation revealed the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIB. The patient underwent complete cytoreductive surgery. On postoperative day 27, the patient received the first cycle of combination chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel (175 mg/m\u00b2; 3-hour infusion) and carboplatin (at a dose corresponding to an area under the curve of 5 mg/mL/minute). The patient subsequently received five cycles of standard carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Genetic analysis of peripheral blood DNA revealed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations were absent, but tissue samples from a pretreatment tumor biopsy were positive for the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) test (Myriad Genetics, Inc.). The patient received oral niraparib maintenance therapy at a bolus of 200 mg daily after first-line chemotherapy. Figure 4 and  show the laboratory data. Her RBC count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count were 297\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 10.5 g/dL, 35\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b2/\u03bcL, and 21.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, respectively, when she started niraparib therapy. Immediately after the start of niraparib treatment (that is, 6 months after surgery), sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) was orally administered to treat anemia. Forty days after the start of niraparib therapy, peripheral blood cell counts, hematocrit levels, platelet counts, white blood cell count, and neutrophil count decreased to 231\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 7.8 g/dL, 9.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2074/\u03bcL, 18\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b2/\u03bcL, and 323/\u03bcL, respectively (). Niraparib therapy was discontinued, but hemoglobin levels were further reduced to 7.0 g/dL. The patient had transient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Blood examination showed macrocytic anemia [mean corpuscular volume, 99.1 fL (82\u201398 fL); mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 33.8 pg (26\u201332 pg/mL); and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 35.1 g/dL (31\u201334 g/dL)]. Furthermore, blood tests showed high serum ferritin levels 350 ng/mL (10\u2013148 ng/mL) and reticulocyte 3.5% (0.5\u20132.0%), low serum total iron-binding capacity 260 \u03bcg/dL (263\u2013457 \u03bcg/dL), and serum levels of iron 141 \u03bcg/dL (32\u2013170 \u03bcg/dL), bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL (0.4\u20131.5 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase 190 U/L (120\u2013225 U/L), folic acid 8.0 ng/mL (2.1\u201310.1 ng/mL), vitamin B12 401 pg/mL (180\u2013914 pg/mL), and transferrin 211 mg/dL (190\u2013320 mg/dL) were in the normal range. Chest radiography, electrocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound, and thorax, abdominal, and pelvic computerized tomography were normal. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with niraparib-related anemia. Niraparib therapy was discontinued for 2 weeks, and two units of packed RBC were transfused. Thereafter, the patient resumed oral niraparib therapy at a bolus of 100 mg daily and then increased to 200 mg 2 weeks later, but immediately exhibited grade 3 anemia. The patients required two units of packed RBC transfusions twice to maintain serum hemoglobin levels above 10 g/dL. RBC transfusions, dose interruption, and dose reduction were used to manage grade 3 anemia. SFC was discontinued and changed to oral FCH after blood transfusion. She began taking oral FCH at a dose of 500 mg daily 10 months after her surgery. Niraparib therapy was maintained at a daily dose of 100 mg until the following month. After continuous administration of FCH, the peripheral blood cell counts recovered gradually with stable Hb counts fluctuating between 10.7 and 12.5 g/dL. One year after surgery, niraparib therapy is still maintained at a daily dose of 200 mg. Oral administration of FCH was discontinued because the hemoglobin level exceeded 12 g/dL. Then, the serum hemoglobin levels decreased again. However, our patient no longer required blood transfusions and Hb levels stabilized at around 10\u201311 g/dL. She resumed oral FCH therapy after 8 weeks of pause, showing efficacy again. The follow-up is ongoing, and she has never been transfused.  presents laboratory findings in this patient before and after treatment with FCH. She has survived disease-free for 25 months after initial surgery. There is no sign of radiological recurrence with a normal serum CA125 level until now. She reached a total dose of approximately 90,000 mg and 135,000 mg of niraparib and FCH, respectively. We obtained the patient\u2019s informed consent to publish this case report.",

    "original_case": "A 50-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of \u201cburning\u201d pain in his right foot. He had a background history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Grave\u2019s disease that required partial thyroidectomy, alcohol dependency, and a 30-pack year history of smoking. His atrial fibrillation was managed with metoprolol only, a cardio-selective beta blocker, and his thyroid function was supplemented with levothyroxine. There had been no recent new medications commenced. There was no known prior history of peripheral vascular disease or diabetes. On examination, his right foot was cool to touch without discoloration or tissue loss. He had a strong posterior tibialis pulse and an absent dorsalis pedis pulse. There was reduced sensation in both feet due to longstanding alcoholic peripheral neuropathy; lower limb motor function was intact. His left lower limb had a full complement of pulses. Doppler assessment by his bedside showed a triphasic signal over the right mid anterior tibial artery, indicating normal flow, but confirmed the absence of arterial flow through the dorsalis pedis artery on the right foot. Computerized tomographic angiography from the arch of the aorta to the lower limbs confirmed the examination findings, demonstrating patent right posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, and a right anterior tibial artery that occluded distally with no flow into the dorsalis pedis artery . The right foot vascular arch was preserved, with the main inflow being via the posterior tibial artery. There was no large vessel occlusion proximally in the thigh, and no aortoiliac abnormalities. Given the chronicity of the symptoms and investigation findings, his right foot pain was attributed to alcohol-related neuropathy and the patient was discharged from hospital with lifestyle modifying advice. Subsequently, he had presented to the emergency department on several occasions over the following few days with the same complaint. Two consecutive blood investigations including total leukocyte counts, neutrophil percentage, and hemoglobin levels were within normal values, while platelet counts on both occasions were marginally elevated at 549 \u00d7 10^9/L and 440 \u00d7 10^9/L, respectively. Furthermore, blood coagulation profiles, which included activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratios were within normal limits on both occasions. With similar examination findings to his previous admissions and normal biochemical markers, he was again discharged with analgesic medication. A week later, he was brought into the emergency department with acute confusion, bilateral foot pain, hyponatremia, and elevated inflammatory markers. This time his total leukocyte count was elevated at 18 \u00d7 10^9/L, hemoglobin concentration was 119 g/L, platelet count was 350 \u00d7 10^9/L, and the hematocrit assay was 0.35/L, which remained unchanged from hematocrit values at previous visits. Likewise, coagulation profiles remained normal. A septic workup, which included a lumbar puncture, did not reveal an obvious infective cause. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were unremarkable. Lower limb venous Doppler assessment was negative for deep venous thromboses. His hyponatremia was appropriately corrected with fluid restriction resulting in resolution of confusion. However, on this occasion, he complained of worsening pain in both feet with a rapid onset of new livedo reticularis of both feet. At presentation, the working diagnosis was of a cardioembolic phenomenon in the context of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and he was commenced on therapeutic anticoagulation. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram did not show an intramural thrombus or a patent foramen ovale. Fig. 1 CT-angiography of the lower limbs demonstrating the right anterior tibial artery occluding in the distal leg (white arrow) with a patent right posterior tibial artery (yellow arrow). Note normal arteriogram of the left leg Full size image The following day, the patient\u2019s condition and limb pain worsened; he had \u201ctrash feet\u201d and new motor dysfunction of the feet. Overnight, his lower limb ischemia had worsened rapidly to the point where revascularization was no longer a viable option. A repeat CT-angiogram of the lower limbs showed absent arterial flow of contrast bilaterally below the mid-leg, with no evidence of aortic or large vessel pathology . He was deemed to have non-salvageable Rutherford Grade 3 acute limb ischemia in bilateral lower limbs below the knees. To avoid the complication of multiorgan failure that may have resulted from release of myoglobin, intramuscular potassium, and inflammatory cytokines, he underwent emergent bilateral above-knee amputations, with satisfactory improvement in his clinical status.

The red lines indicate the point of angiographic \u201ccut-off\u201d of leg blood supply Full size image A cause for his trash feet was not found prior to the operation that was empirically attributed to cardioembolic pathology. However, the indicator to search for another diagnosis of acute bilateral arterial occlusion of his leg arteries was a positive direct antiglobulin test that indicated the presence of cold agglutinins in his blood. This was performed during blood grouping before major surgical intervention. These findings led to further serological testing, including serum immunofixation electrophoresis. This indicated the presence of a monoclonal B cell population involving 32% of his total lymphocyte count, as well as a mixed IgM Kappa and IgM Lambda cryoglobulinemia, an indication for bone marrow assessment.",
    "rewritten_case": "A Caucasian male of roughly 50 years of age arrived at the emergency department complaining of a persistent sensation of \"burning\" in his right foot. His medical history included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Grave\u2019s disease that was treated with a partial thyroidectomy, alcohol dependency, and a significant history of smoking. His atrial fibrillation was managed with metoprolol, a cardio-selective beta blocker, and his thyroid function was supplemented with levothyroxine. No recent new medications were introduced. He had no known prior history of peripheral vascular disease or diabetes. His right foot, upon examination, was cool to touch without discoloration or tissue loss. He had a strong posterior tibialis pulse and an absent dorsalis pedis pulse. There was reduced sensation in both feet due to longstanding alcoholic peripheral neuropathy; however, his lower limb motor function was intact. His left lower limb had a full complement of pulses.\n\nA bedside Doppler assessment showed a triphasic signal over the right mid anterior tibial artery, indicating normal flow, but confirmed the absence of arterial flow through the dorsalis pedis artery on the right foot. Computerized tomographic angiography from the arch of the aorta to the lower limbs confirmed the examination findings, demonstrating patent right posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, and a right anterior tibial artery that occluded distally with no flow into the dorsalis pedis artery. The right foot vascular arch was preserved, with the main inflow being via the posterior tibial artery. There was no large vessel occlusion proximally in the thigh, and no aortoiliac abnormalities. \n\nThe patient was discharged from hospital with lifestyle modifying advice and his right foot pain was attributed to alcohol-related neuropathy. However, he presented to the emergency department several times subsequently with the same complaint. Blood investigations including total leukocyte counts, neutrophil percentage, and hemoglobin levels were within normal values, while platelet counts were marginally elevated. Blood coagulation profiles were within normal limits. He was again discharged with analgesic medication.\n\nAt some point after, he was admitted to the emergency department with acute confusion, bilateral foot pain, hyponatremia, and elevated inflammatory markers. Total leukocyte count was elevated, hemoglobin concentration was 119 g/L, platelet count was 350 \u00d7 10^9/L, and the hematocrit assay was 0.35/L. Coagulation profiles remained normal. A septic workup, which included a lumbar puncture, did not reveal an obvious infective cause. CT and MRI of the brain were unremarkable. Lower limb venous Doppler assessment was negative for deep venous thromboses. His hyponatremia was appropriately corrected with fluid restriction resulting in resolution of confusion.\n\nHowever, he complained of worsening pain in both feet with a rapid onset of new livedo reticularis of both feet.

Upon arrival at the facility and during the medical screening, he complained of persistent intractable epigastric pain, along with pleuritic chest pain with multiple episodes of vomiting over the previous 4 days. He further complained of dysphagia and odynophagia. At the time, he denied any past medical history and/or swallowing any foreign body. He admitted to smoking marijuana on a daily basis. During the initial care, he was given ondansetron (Zofran) 4 mg tablets and 30 mg of aluminum hydroxide/magnesium solution as well as two hydroxide/simethicone tablets orally. The patient subsequently became more subjectively comfortable, but the chest pain continued to persist. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was done during the same period and was evaluated by the on-call physician as being suspicious for acute pericarditis .\n\nOn the basis of the assessment by the on-call physician, he was transferred to a local emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. In the first ED, physical examination indicated a normotensive, mildly tachycardic patient with moderate epigastric pain and otherwise normal physical examination. He admitted that his vomiting has improved but he still continues to have dysphagia. The patient underwent a series of laboratory tests that included complete blood count, serological liver function tests, a complete serum chemistry panel, and a computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. The initial laboratory findings were significant for a mild leukocytosis, and the CT revealed pericholecystic fluid, distal esophageal edema, and dilation with questionable air in the esophageal wall, and possible hiatal hernia .\n\nThe repeated EKG in the ED confirmed the possible diagnosis of pericarditis as well as concern for possible cholecystitis. Subsequently, the patient was transferred for a higher level of care to a regional medical center for further evaluation. During the course of care at the new ED, the patient continued to present with tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and persistent epigastric and chest pain. The patient\u2019s EKG continued to show diffuse ST elevation, while his cardiac markers remained within normal limits. Chest X-ray revealed a questionable infiltrate. Formal right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and showed gallbladder wall thickening near the fundus of unclear etiology but no gallstones and was otherwise normal. His laboratory results were significant for white blood cells 12.5 \u00d7 10^9 per liter, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 28 millimeters per hour, C-reactive protein 21.77 milligrams per decilitre, and procalcitonin 11.02 nanograms per milliliter, all elevated. Troponin and the remainder of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were grossly unremarkable.\n\nThe patient was treated with 2 liter of normal saline intravenously and 4 mg Zofran intravenously. Pain medication of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg orally as well as famotidine (Pepcid) 20 mg orally and gastrointestinal (GI) cocktail (aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/lidocaine) 30 ml orally were given. Additionally, the patient was given ceftazidime 1 g intravenously and azithromycin 500 mg orally. While in the ED, he continued to deny swallowing a foreign body or ingesting chemicals that may have caused his symptoms. Upon further review of the patient\u2019s symptoms, imaging studies, laboratory results, and recommendation by the surgery team, the patient was transferred to a nearby pediatric subspecialty hospital for further evaluation by pediatric surgery and gastroenterology and possible endoscopic evaluation of his esophagus.\n\nOn arrival to the pediatric subspecialty hospital, he continued to be tachycardic, but afebrile. In the ED, he received 4.5 gram (g) piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), 20 mg Pepcid, and 4 mg Zofran, all intravenously. He immediately underwent an esophagram with water-soluble contrast that revealed a filling defect in the distal esophagus. After further questioning by the pediatric surgery team, he admitted that he had swallowed \u201ca bag\u201d prior to his arrest but would not disclose the contents of the bag. Subsequently, he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and a plastic bag was discovered in the distal esophagus and removed .\n\nPatient was hospitalized with antibiotic therapy with intravenous Zosyn 3.375 g every 8 hours for suspected aspiration pneumonia and transitioned to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) 875 mg tablets on the third day post-procedure for an additional 7 days of treatment. The patient also continued on 20 mg oral Pepcid twice a day. Further evaluation by pediatric cardiology and repeated EKG confirmed the diagnosis of pericarditis, likely post-infectious in etiology. His esophagus also showed evidence of achalasia, which was attributed to the prolonged irritation of the epithelial surface and the inflammation in the surrounding region.\n\nWhile awaiting for the outpatient follow-up, 7 days after discharge, he returned to the local ED with persistent left-sided chest pain and dyspnea worsened with exertions and wheezing. The patient was noted to have significant leukocytosis, and a CT of his chest revealed a left-sided loculated hydropneumothorax with central cavitary lesion. He was then transferred back to the pediatric surgery service at the same subspecialty hospital for further evaluation. Given concern for esophageal perforation, a repeat esophagram was performed showing normal esophageal caliber and contour without extravasation of contrast. The patient was then admitted to pediatric service with placement of a thoracostomy tube by the interventional radiology service. He received 4 days of thrombolytic therapy via the thoracostomy with satisfactory output. The thoracostomy tube was removed 10 days later. Infectious disease was also consulted and agreed with an antibiotic regimen of intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin during his course in the hospital.",

On physical examination, the patient was not in acute distress, no scleral icterus was noted, extraocular movements were intact, with oral ulcers on the hard palate. The patient did not have evidence of jugular vein distention (JVD), carotid bruits, and no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. Cardiac examination found normal rate and rhythm with audible S1 and S2. Lung examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes. The patient\u2019s abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds. The patient noted papules along lateral digits and tender palmar maculopapular lesions, synovitis of the hands and feet, but no noticeable edema of all extremities. Neurological examination was without focal deficits, and he was alert, awake, and oriented, answering questions appropriately, with strength of 5/5 on upper and lower extremities. The patient did not have significant past medical history, did not take any medications, and his only surgery was a circumcision. The patient\u2019s family history was negative for rheumatological disease, his mother is a thalassemia carrier. The patient denies any tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. The patient is a university student. Three days prior to admission, the patient sought his primary care physician who prescribed 5 days of azithromycin 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg on days 1\u20135, and a methylprednisolone dose pack. An outpatient chest computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed an ill-defined density in the right lower lobe and scattered micronodules. The patient did not improve and presented to the hospital .\n\nOn hospital day 1, X-rays of hands and wrists were normal. Repeat CT imaging revealed additional ground glass opacities in the periphery of the right lung and a 6.5 mm right middle lobe nodule (Figs. 2 and 3). MRI of the lower extremities (Fig 4) showed nonspecific edema of the left distal sartorius muscle, but this finding was deemed to be nonspecific and not relevant to the patient\u2019s condition when reviewed by the musculoskeletal radiologists and the treating physicians. There was an absence of other evidence to suggest the presence of muscle inflammation. Echocardiogram and CT and MRI imaging of brain, sinuses, and spine were normal. A skin biopsy of the left palm revealed superficial mounds of parakeratosis and sparse lymphocytic inflammation, suggestive of a resolving spongiotic or psoriasiform dermatitis. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies were normal. Laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL (13.7\u201317.5 g/dL), absolute lymphocytes 1000/\u00b5L (1.3\u20133.6 1000/\u00b5L), creatinine 0.7 mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) 91 IU/L (0\u201350 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 58 IU/L (5\u201334 IU/L), ferritin 920 ng/mL (12\u2013300 ng/mL), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 91 IU/L (55\u2013170 IU/L). Urinalysis was positive for trace ketones, otherwise negative for leukocyte esterase/nitrites/blood/protein. Infectious workup revealed positive M. pneumoniae IgM and negative IgG, Epstein\u2013Barr viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, and parvovirus B19 IgM. Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and parvovirus B19 PCR were negative. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by nucleic acid amplification test (SARS-CoV-2 by NAAT) was negative. Two sets of anaerobic and aerobic blood cultures drawn from two separate venipuncture sites transported at room temperature had no plated growth after 5 days. No cultures for fungi were collected. Urine culture grew < 1000 colony forming units per milliliter. The patient completed 10 days of oral doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for M. pneumoniae infection without improvement.

The patient had undergone appendectomy and left inguinal hernia surgery 50 and 10 years ago, respectively. The patient has been receiving oral treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and hypertension for 5 years. At first visit, the patient\u2019s height and weight was 163 cm and 50 kg, respectively. His blood pressure was 136/80 mmHg, pulse was regular at 62 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C. He had no history of smoking or drinking, and there was nothing significant in his family history. Physical examination revealed that his right testicle was elastic, hard, and enlarged to a size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950 mm^3. No obvious lymphadenopathy on the body surface was palpable, and no gynecomastia was found. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and tumor marker levels (AFP, HCG, and LDH) showed no abnormal findings. Ultrasound findings showed a mosaic shadow inside the right testicle with no abnormal findings in the left testicle. Lung CT showed no evidence of coin lesions or effusion . Contrast-enhanced CT showed an enlarged para-aortic lymph node (18\u2009\u00d7\u200916 and 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910 mm^2) , and a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200945 mm^3 mass with uneven contents was found in the right testicle . No evidence of distant metastasis was found during the other diagnostic procedures. Fig. 1 Lung CT showed no evidence of any coin lesions (A). Contrast-enhanced CT showed enlargements of the para-aortic lymph node (B, 18\u2009\u00d7\u200916 mm^2, white arrow), and a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200945 mm^3 mass with uneven contents was found in the right testicle (C, white arrow). The diagnosis was a testicular tumor (cT1, N1, M0, S0, and TNM stage IIA). The resected testicular tumor was 55\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm^3 in size and 63 g in weight. The cut surface was yellowish-white with bleeding and solid, and the testicular tumor was localized in the testicle . Full size image For the right testicular tumor, the TNM classification was cT1, N1, M0, S0, and the clinical stage was IIA [1]. The patient underwent inguinal orchiectomy in September 2020. The resected testicular tumor was 55\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm^3 in size and 63 g in weight. The cut surface was yellowish-white with bleeding and solid, and the testicular tumor was localized in the testicle . Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis, with distinct nucleoli and large nuclei, proliferating in a nest-like manner with some necrosis, and no specific differentiation tendency was observed. Vascular infiltration of tumor cells was also observed. The tumor was poorly differentiated (Fig. 2 A, B). Fig. 2 Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis; the tumor cells have distinct nucleoli and large nuclei; they proliferate in a nest-like manner with some necrosis, and no specific differentiation tendency was observed. Vascular infiltration of tumor cells was observed following hematoxylin and eosin staining (A: \u00d7\u200940, B: \u00d7\u2009100) Full size image Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for SF-1  and Ki-67 , partially positive for inhibin , and negative for CAM5.2, CK7, CK20, C-KIT, CD30, LCA, GATA-3, TTF-1, and PAX8. Calretinin was expressed in approximately 5% of tumor cells , thus sex cord/gonadal stroma components were considered to be involved. Fig. 3 As per immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for SF-1 (A, \u00d7\u2009200) and Ki-67 (B, \u00d7\u2009200), and partially positive for inhibin (C, \u00d7\u2009200), and calretinin was expressed in about 5% of tumor cells (D, \u00d7\u2009200) Full size image The tumor did not extend into the tunical albuginea, and vascular infiltration was found in one part of the tumor.

His blood pressure was recorded at 136/80 mmHg, pulse was regular at 62 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C. He had no history of smoking or drinking, and his family history did not raise any red flags. \n\nDuring physical examination, it was observed that his right testicle was elastic, hard, and enlarged to a size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950 mm^3. There were no lymph nodes palpable on the body surface, and no gynecomastia was found. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and tumor marker levels (AFP, HCG, and LDH) were within normal limits. Ultrasound images showed a mosaic shadow inside the right testicle, while the left testicle appeared normal. \n\nLung CT scans did not show any evidence of coin lesions or effusion. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed an enlarged para-aortic lymph node (18\u2009\u00d7\u200916 and 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910 mm^2), and a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200945 mm^3 mass with uneven contents in the right testicle. No evidence of distant metastasis was found during the other diagnostic procedures. A diagnosis of a testicular tumor (cT1, N1, M0, S0, and TNM stage IIA) was made. \n\nThe patient underwent inguinal orchiectomy, and the resected testicular tumor measured 55\u2009\u00d7\u200945\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm^3 and weighed 63 g. The cut surface was yellowish-white with bleeding and solid, and the testicular tumor was localized in the testicle. Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis, with distinct nucleoli and large nuclei, proliferating in a nest-like manner with some necrosis. Vascular infiltration of tumor cells was also observed. The tumor was poorly differentiated. \n\nImmunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for SF-1 and Ki-67, partially positive for inhibin, and negative for CAM5.2, CK7, CK20, C-KIT, CD30, LCA, GATA-3, TTF-1, and PAX8. Calretinin was expressed in approximately 5% of tumor cells, indicating that sex cord/gonadal stroma components were involved. The tumor did not extend into the tunical albuginea, and vascular infiltration was found in a part of the tumor. The spermatic cord stumps were negative. Thus, the tumor was diagnosed as pT1, N1, M0, S0, and TNM stage IIA.",

    "original_case": "Case 1  \nA 13-year-old Iranian boy came to our pediatric emergency department, a referral center affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, with the chief complaint of yellowish skin and two red spots on his right leg. Furthermore, his mother mentioned that he had nosebleeds for a week prior to the admission. He developed icterus 2 months before the admission, and after preliminary laboratory evaluations, which revealed elevated liver enzymes, he was diagnosed with hepatitis. One day before admission, his mother suddenly saw some petechiae-like lesions on his right leg, so she brought the boy to our center. We decided to check CBC and performed liver function tests (LFTs). His preadmission medications included folic acid 5 mg once a day and ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice a day. Physicians had prescribed these drugs because of his previous hepatitis diagnosis. On our primary physical examination, his sclera appeared icteric. He had an ulcer on his lower lip. His lungs were clear, and his heart sounds were normal. On abdominal examination, his liver seemed to be slightly enlarged. He also had evidence of ecchymosis on his right leg.  \nLaboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia on the first CBC [white blood cell count (WBC) 900/\u00b5l, hemoglobin (HB) 7.8 g/dl, platelet count (PLT) 4000/\u00b5l]. His liver enzymes were elevated [aspartate transferase (AST) 68 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 174 U/L, total bilirubin 1 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.29 mg/dL, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 26 U/L] as they had been over the past 2 months. Intending to find the cause of his hepatitis, we checked for common viral hepatitis causes, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), which were all negative. We checked anti-LKM antibody (Ab), anti-dsDNA Ab, cANCA, and pANCA to rule out the possibility of autoimmune disorders, though we did not find any of them to be positive. We also checked ceruloplasmin and serum copper levels to rule out Wilson\u2019s disease, and neither was in favor of Wilson. We checked coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM, which were both negative. We also asked about his past drug history (including herbal drugs) and any potential toxin exposure, but we did not find that could have caused hepatitis. Moreover, we performed chromosome breakage test, which was negative, ruling out Fanconi anemia.  \nIn terms of his pancytopenia, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. The results showed severe hypocellularity (approximately 15%), which was low for his age. Pictures of bone marrow biopsy and aspiration are shown in Fig. 1. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry was done on his bone marrow sample, and there was no evidence of leukemia or lymphoma. Our treatment plan was immunosuppressive therapy (IST). The patient was started on equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (40 mg/kg/day for 4 days), prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day), and cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day). After receiving treatment, his CBC stabilized (enough to discharge the patient from hospital with further follow-up scheduled) 10 days after IST initiation, and eventually, he was discharged in good condition.  \nFig. 1  \nHypocellular smear from bone marrow aspiration revealing a few scattered myeloid cells and lymphocytes. On bone marrow biopsy, which revealed hypocellularity for his age, intertrabecular marrow spaces were shown to have been replaced by fatty cells beside the presence of some nucleated cells, including lymphocytes, plasma cells, and erythroid cells  \nFull size image  \nCase 2  \nAn 8-year-old Iranian boy was brought to our emergency department with the chief complaint of yellowish skin and abdominal distension. He was relatively well until 3 weeks prior to admission. His initial symptoms were anorexia, weakness, and fever, which led him to a medical center. Primary laboratory evaluations were done there, and he was diagnosed with fulminant hepatitis on the basis of elevated international normalized ratio (INR). He also had extremely high liver enzymes. At that medical center, he had received supportive care. Then, since our hospital is the referral liver transplant center in Iran, his parents brought him to our emergency department. On initial presentation, he was severely icteric. His abdomen was distended, and ascites and hepatomegaly were observed.  \nOur initial laboratory investigations showed severe elevation of his liver enzymes (AST 1615 U/L, ALT 1880 U/L, total bilirubin 47 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 22.8 mg/dL). At that time, he also had coagulation disorder [prothrombin time (PT) 21.1 seconds and INR 2.5]. Moreover, we detected anemia and mild leukopenia in his CBC, but his platelet count was normal (WBC 2900/\u00b5l, HB 8.3 g/dl, PLT 190,000/\u00b5l). We started searching for the cause of his hepatitis. After checking viral and immunological markers, the only noticeable item we found was a positive COVID-19 IgG Ab. Like the previous patient, he did not report any history of exposure to drugs (including herbal drugs) or hepatotoxic toxins. Moreover, Fanconi anemia was ruled out for the patient by negative chromosome breakage test.  \nDuring the admission course, his situation improved and his liver enzymes began to decrease, but he suddenly developed petechiae on his left hand. So, we immediately checked the CBC, which revealed severe pancytopenia (WBC 500/\u00b5l, HB 7.1g/dl, PLT 20,000/\u00b5l). His platelet count dropped drastically. Therefore, we planned for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and the result showed severe hypocellularity, approximately 20%. Pictures of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are shown in Fig. 1.  \nSince his WBC count was very low, we could not consider a bone marrow transplant, and we decided to try immunosuppressive therapy for him, as the other patient had responded well to it. Unfortunately, after receiving the third dose of ATG, he had an episode of generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure, and he did not show any response to the treatment until that time. Hence, we stopped the chemotherapy and transferred him to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) ward. Unfortunately, he was declared brain dead, due to the low platelet number and coagulopathy.

He had a febrile illness with coryzal symptoms for 3 days, which had resolved 2 days prior to this presentation. There was no history of foreign-body aspiration or trauma. He was born to non-consanguineous parents at term and had an uneventful neonatal period. He did not have any previous hospital admissions or recurrent wheezing episodes and was developmentally normal. On examination, the child was afebrile and not pale or cyanosed. His weight was 8.8 kg (between \u22121SD and \u22122SD), and his length was 82 cm (between median and +1SD). He had moderate respiratory distress with subcostal, intercostal, and suprasternal recessions, and his respiratory rate was 50 breaths per minute. He had a loud expiratory grunt. The chest expansion was reduced on the right side, which was dull to percussion. Auscultation revealed a marked reduction of air entry over the lower and mid zones of the right chest; there were no added sounds. His arterial oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed a pulse rate of 140 per minute and blood pressure of 94/60 mmHg. The apex was felt at the fifth intercostal space lateral to the midclavicular line, and his heart sounds were normal. The rest of the clinical examination was normal. Urgent chest X-ray performed due to lateralizing physical signs showed a well-demarcated opacity involving the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax associated with a tracheal shift to the opposite side . The right heart and diaphragmatic borders were obliterated. Ultrasound scan of the chest revealed fluid-filled right hemithorax suggesting a septate pleural effusion. His full blood count revealed white cell count of 17,000/mm3 (neutrophils 7300/mm3, lymphocytes 8100/mm3, eosinophils 300/mm3), hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 607,000/mm3.

He was treated for a possible right lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic pleural effusion with intravenous cefotaxime 50 mg/kg 8 hourly. Fig. 1 Chest X-ray showing well-demarcated opacity in the lower and mid zones of the right hemithorax with shifting of the trachea to the left side Full size image Due to the absence of fever, negative inflammatory markers, and the unusual nature of the chest X-ray, which led to diagnostic uncertainty, an urgent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the thorax was performed on the following day . This showed a large multiloculated extrapulmonary cystic lesion involving the right hemithorax with a mediastinal shift towards the left side. This was associated with the displacement of the right-side mediastinal structures, including superior and inferior vena cava, narrowing of the right main pulmonary artery, and compression of the right lung superiorly. The lung parenchyma was normal. The CT appearance was in favor of a benign cystic lesion in the mediastinum. The echocardiography was normal.

On admission, initial examination revealed continuous, uncontrolled spasms of the right arm and leg. The patient relied on maximum assistance or was dependent on 2+ helpers for all aspects of self-care. For functional mobility, he required a supervisor/touch assistance for bed mobility, and partial to maximum assistance for transfers.  \nThe patient initially presented to the hospital 6 weeks prior for elevated blood glucose levels in the range of 400\u2013500. The patient did not require intubation and did not have any altered mental status during the hospital course. At the time of discharge, his blood glucose was controlled but his wife stated that, upon returning home, they remained elevated in the 400\u2013500 range. Notably, with the patient\u2019s history of anxiety and depression, he had been started on quetiapine 50 mg nightly earlier in the year, which was subsequently changed to olanzapine 7.5 mg prior to this admission.  \nThe patient had another hospital admission 2 weeks prior with 2-day history of involuntary movements in his right upper and lower extremities. He was evaluated with brain CT, MRI, and EEG and was discharged on haloperidol 5 mg twice daily for his symptoms. EEG was negative for epileptic waveforms, while CT and MRI findings were consistent with changes of nonketotic hyperglycemia. During this admission, laboratory values were positive for mild leukocytosis, blood glucose level of 125 mmol/L, and an A1C of 14.6%. Blood workup for secondary causes of hemichorea was unremarkable. The patient was admitted under the neurology service and was started on clonazepam 2 mg TID and quetiapine 25 mg TID for his symptoms, though with little improvement. Endocrinology was consulted for control of his blood glucose, and he was started on Lantus and sliding scale insulin therapy before discharge to the acute rehabilitation hospital.  \nDuring his 2-week-long admission at the rehabilitation hospital, the patient received daily focused therapy while proper blood glucose control was maintained. He was evaluated by a neurologist, who planned to place him on tetrabenazine which would be started 2\u20133 weeks after insurance approval. At the time of his discharge, significant improvements in all aspects of self-care, bed mobility, and transfers were appreciated. The patient received a follow-up MRI scan with and without contrast 3 weeks after discharge, which showed continued signal abnormality in the left lentiform nucleus with development of signal in the left caudate nucleus . Palliative care was consulted, and at a subsequent visit, symptoms continued to improve with right-sided leg movements drastically decreased. Speech was also noted to be clearer with the patient able to express himself more fluently. The patient was walking with the use of his walker and able to perform his own ADLs.

There were no associated symptoms of headache, fever, weight or appetite change, loss of consciousness, blurred or double vision, dysphagia, or numbness. Furthermore, there were no recent medication changes. One month prior, she had been admitted for encephalopathy, with hyperglycemia greater than 700 and MRI imaging with diffuse low T2 signal in bilateral basal ganglia .  \nAripiprazole 5 mg twice a day was started and continued during her rehabilitation admission. Glucose levels were tightly controlled and maintained under 200 except for three isolated episodes over her 14-day rehabilitation stay. She was admitted to inpatient rehabilitation to work with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to work on her deficits (). Prior to this, she was independent with ADLs, transfers, and mobility. Both of her physical and occupational therapy evaluations noted choreiform movements while sitting at the edge of the bed and at rest in the bilateral upper extremities that decreased with volitional movement; dystonia was present in static standing in the right lower extremity. Speech therapy noted a mild to moderate dysarthria with reduced speech intelligibility. Choreiform movements, dystonia, cognitive deficits, and dysarthria with reduced speech intelligibility were her main barriers in therapy.  \n Improved functional independence measures from admission to discharge for a 78-year-old Haitian female patient from case 2.  \nFull size table  \nPhysical therapy techniques used for chorea and dystonia included volitional movements (that is, grabbing or holding a cup of water); cognitive distraction, prolonged exhalation, meditation; ambulation and weight bearing; balance in parallel bars; visual feedback using mirrors; gait training with and without an assistive device. Occupational therapy techniques for chorea and dystonia included energy conservation techniques using figure-4 technique; endurance exercises including ergometer; deep vibration with noted reduction in chorea movements; mass practice task consisting of grasping and transferring rings from right to left with hand over hand; functional grasp tasks; visual feedback to increase standing unsupported tolerance in preparation for ADLs participation; Sander box with 3-pound dumbbell using mirror as visual feedback; Nu Step reciprocal stepper for gross motor coordination and activity endurance.

The patient received a follow-up MRI scan with and without contrast 3 weeks after discharge, which showed continued signal abnormality in the left lentiform nucleus with development of signal in the left caudate nucleus . Palliative care was consulted, and at a subsequent visit, symptoms continued to improve with right-sided leg movements drastically decreased. Speech was also noted to be clearer with the patient able to express himself more fluently. The patient was walking with the use of his walker and able to perform his own ADLs. Physical therapy and occupational therapy were completed at home, and a plan was made to continue outpatient physical therapy.  \nCase 2  \nA 78-year-old Haitian female with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension was admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit for chorea secondary to new bilateral basal ganglia T1 hyperintensities on MRI, particularly in the right caudate nucleus. She was initially admitted to a level 1 tertiary center with a 3-day history of involuntary upper and lower extremity movements that progressively worsened with generalized weakness compromising her ability to grasp utensils and ambulate. There were no associated symptoms of headache, fever, weight or appetite change, loss of consciousness, blurred or double vision, dysphagia, or numbness. One month prior, she had been admitted for encephalopathy, with hyperglycemia greater than 700 and MRI imaging with diffuse low T2 signal in bilateral basal ganglia.  \nDuring her rehabilitation admission, Aripiprazole 5 mg twice a day was started and glucose levels were tightly controlled. She was admitted to inpatient rehabilitation to work with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to work on her deficits. Prior to this, she was independent with ADLs, transfers, and mobility. Evaluations noted choreiform movements while sitting at the edge of the bed and at rest in the bilateral upper extremities that decreased with volitional movement; dystonia was present in static standing in the right lower extremity. Speech therapy noted a mild to moderate dysarth",

It is noteworthy that the patient reported having chronic lumbar pain for the past 3 months, yet the last few weeks were marked by hyperalgesia without a history of trauma. She complained of night sweating but had no fever, chills, cough, or dyspnea. However, the patient recalled a 1-week history of fever 1 month ago, after taking the second dose of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. She was admitted to the hospital on the same day, and was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases for adequate investigation and management. The patient was known to have hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism\u2014all treated with medications. She also had a history of lumbar L4\u2013L5 disc herniation, for which arthrodesis was performed 4 years ago. She reported a history of unpasteurized dairy product consumption. Owing to the fact that Lebanon is an endemic area for brucellosis, the presence of chronic symptoms with a recent exacerbation shed light on the plausibility of infection with spinal involvement. On physical examination, her temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, blood pressure 150/80 mmHg, and pulse 105 beats per minute. We noted a painful percussion of the lumbar spine at L3/L4 as well as painful passive mobilization and lumbar paravertebral tenderness. No lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly could be observed. On neurological examination, the range of motion was not decreased for lower extremities; neither sensory deficits nor sphincter abnormalities were present. The performed blood tests were indicative of inflammation: hemoglobin 9.4 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm per hour, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 70 mg/l. White blood cell count was 6410/\u03bcl, and leukocyte formula showed 56% neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes, and 7% monocytes. Blood chemistry was within the normal values. Bacterial serology indicated that anti-antibodies were positive at a titer of 1/5120 (reference range 1/180). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, performed on 9 July 2021, revealed a multifocal spondylodiscitis involvement of the T12\u2013L1 and L3\u2013L4 discs and their respective adjacent vertebral bodies, with epidural thickening, significant foraminal narrowing at L3\u2013L4 level, and the formation of a paravertebral abscess of 9 mm next to T12. No nerve root compression lesions of the spine were identified. The MRI also showed a grade I anterolisthesis (spondylolisthesis) at L4\u2013L5 (Figs. 1, 2, and 3).

The patient had been experiencing chronic lumbar pain for the past three months but had noticed an increase in pain sensitivity over the past few weeks, with no history of trauma. She had also been experiencing night sweats, though no fever, chills, cough, or dyspnea were present. She did recall experiencing a fever for a week about a month prior, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nUpon her admission, the patient was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases for further investigation and management.

    "original_case": "An 89-year-old Caucasian woman accidentally drank a sip of a chemical while visiting her laundry, which had been carelessly poured into a bottle of water. Her medical record included a surgical aortic valve replacement, triple coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and arterial hypertension. The family described her as being completely autonomous at home, as proved by the fact that she worked in her own dry cleaning shop until the age of 88. The exact amount of ingested chemical is still uncertain owing to the high variability of product concentration and the proprietary formulas used by the different brands. However, the patient later described having just a sip before realizing, based on the taste, that it was not water. Around 10 minutes after ingestion she became drowsy and the emergency medical service was activated by her relatives. When she arrived at the emergency room, approximately 50 minutes after the ingestion, her vitals were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3, SpO2 96%, respiratory rate of 34 breaths/minute with a snoring breathing, heart rate of 51 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 115/55 mmHg. The first blood-gas analysis did not show relevant abnormalities: pH of 7.38 and lactate 2.4 mmol/L. The poison control center was immediately contacted and promptly provided the available information regarding the chemical toxicity: it is not caustic; it is a fat-soluble product, which tends to accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS); its half-life is extremely variable and uncertain in humans, with an estimated biological half-life of 144 hours; and its immediate life-threatening aspects are CNS and respiratory drive depression, and risk of cardiac arrhythmias, possibly owing to myocardial sensitization to endogenous and exogenous catecholamines. No antidote is available for the chemical. Characteristics of the chemical intoxication are summarized in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overview of chemical characteristics and toxicity Full size image The sudden and deep CNS depression led the whole team to presume that a large quantity of the chemical had been ingested and that its effects on the CNS could presumably last for several days. This scenario would have led to prolonged mechanical ventilation, a long intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and a high risk of ICU-related complications, especially considering the patient\u2019s advanced age. After a team evaluation, the patient was intubated and admitted to the ICU. Intubation was devoid of any complication; however, the patient developed severe hypoxemia, with the need to increase FiO2 up to 1. After 4 hours of mechanical ventilation, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was 70 mmHg with an FiO2 of 0.6 [ratio between partial pressure of oxygen and FiO2 (PaO2:FiO2) of 117]. Oxygenation improved in the following 3\u20134 hours, reaching an arterial partial pressure of oxygen of 155 mmHg at FiO2 of 0.6 (PaO2:FiO2 of 258). The patient showed some hemodynamic instability and required fluid resuscitation with 3000 ml of crystalloids infused over the first 4 hours. The concentration of lactate was rapidly normalized and the patient had a normal urinary output. Five hours after the accidental ingestion, two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia occurred, promptly terminated with adenosine. Initially, the patient remained comatose, with a GCS of 3. During the observation in the ICU, her neurological condition started to improve and the patient suddenly woke up and self-extubated herself 12 hours after the ingestion (3 a.m.). Her respiratory function had recovered, she could cough properly and was completely awake. At 8 a.m., her vital signs were as follows: SpO2 98% with 2 L/minute nasal oxygen, respiratory rate of 17 breaths/minute, heart rate of 70 beats/minute despite a brief and self-limiting episode of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 145/50 mmHg, and urinary output 1400 ml from hospital arrival. Less than 24 hours after ingestion she was discharged from the ICU, and 4 days later she was discharged from the hospital. No signs of liver or renal failure appeared, and the only complication during her hospital stay was a single episode of blood in the sputum. A blood and urine sample taken immediately after the discharge from the ICU was sent to the forensic toxicology department of the University of Milano for a quantitative measurement of the chemical. The results were as follows: blood concentration 9.45 ng/ml and urine concentration 25.5 ng/mg.",

He was born at 38 weeks via vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy to nonconsanguineous parents (mother 33 years old, and father 38 years old). His birth weight was 2.95 kg, length was 52 cm, and head circumference was 35 cm. His Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score was 7 at 1 minute, and 10 at 5 minutes. Down\u2019s syndrome was diagnosed soon after birth, based on typical facial features and presence of palmar crease, and later confirmed karyotypically for Trisomy 21. His two siblings, aged 6 and 4 years, were alive and healthy. Further social and family history was unremarkable. From a growth standpoint, at birth, he was 10th percentile for weight and 25th percentile for length. At both 6 months and 1 year, he was 25th percentile for weight and 50th percentile for length. His head circumference was 50th percentile at birth, at 6 months it was at 97th percentile, and at 1 year when he presented to the clinic, it was 20 standard deviations (SD) above the 99th percentile. From a growth milestone standpoint, at 9 months, he smiled and laughed at \u201cpeek-a-boo,\u201d lifted arms up to be picked up, crawled, and sat up without support. However, at 12 months, his parents noticed that he cried more, stopped responding to his name, and preferred to lay flat rather than crawl or sit. He was also less vocal and less interested in toys. On physical examination, he appeared to have macrocephaly, along with signs of Down\u2019s syndrome including flat nasal bridge, upward slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthic folds, and simian crease. He appeared to be mildly irritable. Cardiac, respiratory, abdominal, genitourinary, and integumentary examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination showed intact cranial nerves and sensations to noxious touch. However, there was generalized muscular hypotonia with muscle wasting, with \u22122 bilateral knee and ankle reflexes, and bilateral upgoing plantars. His initial blood tests did not show any abnormality. His hemoglobin (Hb) was 11.5 g/dL and white blood count (WBC) was 13 \u00d7 10^9/L with normal differential. His liver and renal functions were within normal limits. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were also within normal limits. Hepatitis B and C serology were negative. Urinalysis and chest X-ray also did not show any abnormality. He was admitted, and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a large cystic tumor in the right parieto temporo occipital regions . Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast showed a 10.9 \u00d7 11.4 \u00d7 8.9 cm, heterogeneously enhancing, mixed solid and cystic supratentorial mass, with surrounding vasogenic edema in the right parieto temporo occipital lobe. The solid component was dural based, measuring 6.4 \u00d7 6.0 cm, showing heterogeneous intensity on T2W imaging with marked enhancement on post-contrast images. There was a midline shift towards the left, with compression on the ipsilateral right lateral ventricle. Moderate obstructive hydrocephalus was also noted (Figs. 2, 3).\n\nFig. 1 A, B Pre-operative CT without contrast: Axial images show a mixed density heterogeneously enhancing mass in the Right posterior parieto temporo occipital locations (red arrows) Full size image Fig. 2 Pre-operative MRI without contrast.

Removal of the posterior dural-based solid mass was omitted due its attachment to the highly vascular dura mater. Postoperative course was uneventful. The tumor specimen was sent for histopathological examination, which revealed low cellularity with intervening bands of fibrous tissue and collagen fibers. Neoplastic cells had a high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio with hyperchromatic nuclei. Some areas showed hypercellular pleomorphism, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation. Some cells with rhabdoid morphology were also present with abnormal mitosis . Staining was performed for integrase interactor 1 (INI-1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), desmin, creatine kinase (CK), synaptophysin, and Ki-67. INI-1 came out strongly positive, ruling out atypical teratoid and rhabdoid tumors. A large proportion of tumor cells were positive for GFAP  and negative for synaptophysin, desmin, and CK. Ki-67 index was low in the majority of the tumor. However, areas with increased cellularity had raised Ki-67 to 50%. Morphology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis, which correlated with clinical and radiological findings. Further molecular studies were not done.\n\nFig. 4 A Low-power view highlighting collagenized septa with small cell population having high N/C ratio.

A residual mass (3.1 \u00d7 1.3 cm on axial images) was seen adherent to the dura of posterior interhemispheric fissure . The patient was subsequently discharged home. At follow-up at 6 weeks, his mother reported gradual functional improvement, along with recovery of motor milestones evidenced by his ability to sit with support, and return of moderate hand grip.\n\nFig. 6 A, B Postoperative CT without contrast: A major bulk of the tumor had been removed with a small enhancing dural residual mass (2.9 \u00d7 1.3 cm on axial images) adherent to posterior interhemispheric fissure (red arrows).

This mass was adherent to the posterior interhemispheric fissure, as well as the tentorium cerebelli (Figs. 7, 8). Keeping in view this extremely rare presentation with growing residual mass adherent to the dura, prospective treatment options were discussed by the multidisciplinary tumor board.

    "original_case": "A 40-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression was brought to hospital with a 7-day history of anxiety and little to no sleep. In the day prior to presentation, she exhibited disorganized speech and delusions that her mother was going to die. In the emergency department, she was overinclusive and talking nonsensically. She was paranoid of security staff, endorsed auditory hallucinations, believed she was at a \u201cs\u00e9ance,\u201d and appeared to be responding to internal stimuli. Consequently, she was admitted to psychiatry for further workup and management. Of note, an emergency physician noted organized speech when she was initially seen, though this was not observed by the psychiatry team.\n\nHer thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at the time of admission was 123.90 mIU/L (reference range 0.20\u20134.00 mIU/L). Complete blood count, electrolytes, blood glucose, and creatinine were all normal. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swab was negative. The patient was on no medications prior to admission and had no history of hypothyroidism or other medical conditions. She had previously been prescribed stimulant medications for ADHD but had not taken any stimulants for months owing to previous intolerance. She denied any substance use, including alcohol and nicotine, leading to her presentation, and urine toxicology screen was negative for amphetamines or other substances.\n\nThe patient was living alone in an apartment prior to being brought to hospital. She had a boyfriend and no children. She was unemployed at the time of admission but was to start a new job working with immigrants. Her mother had a history of hypothyroidism, and the patient was not sure if she had any other family history of thyroid or autoimmune disorders. No family history of other conditions was identified.\n\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms fluctuated when she was seen the day following admission. She initially was more organized and was able to describe experiencing persecutory and religious delusions in the week prior to admission. Nonetheless, she continued to experience delusional beliefs that her mother was going to die. Later in the day, she was noted to be more tangential and was unable to answer questions.\n\nWhen seen by the endocrinology consult team, the patient reported experiencing cold intolerance, fatigue, dry skin, poor appetite, and hair loss. She did not notice any weight gain. She reported feeling her voice was weaker and that she felt like she had a frog in her throat. The patient reported that she had previously been diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis but that this had not been felt to be sufficiently severe to require treatment at that time. While documentation from a previous assessment is unavailable, the patient was noted to have an elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase result (67.1 kIU/L, reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L) approximately 5 years prior, with TSH within normal limits, and this may have been why she had been evaluated as not requiring treatment. On physical examination, she had a slightly enlarged thyroid gland, hyperreflexia, and mild tremor. Notably, delayed relaxation or diminished deep tendon reflexes are typically observed in previous case reports, and it is unclear why hyperreflexia and mild tremor were observed on physical examination in this case. It is possible that this finding was erroneous; however, further description of findings in cases may provide more clarity. Cardiac examination was unremarkable, and no nail changes were observed. Additional blood work showed decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) of 0.9 nmol/L (reference range 1.1\u20132.8 nmol/L), free T3 of 2.8 pmol/L (reference range 3.5\u20136.5 pmol/L), and free thyroxine (T4) of 4.6 pmol/L (reference range 10.0\u201325.0 pmol/L). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies were elevated at 147.6 kIU/L (reference range 0.0\u201334.0 kIU/L). Anti-thyroglobulin antibody and thyroglobulin levels were within normal limits. Neck ultrasound described a heterogeneous, hyperemic, non-enlarged thyroid gland with hypoechoic nodules abutting the posterior aspect and inferior aspects of the thyroid gland.",

She also suffered from depression after the recent death of her husband. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, while she presented with rectal tenesmus and pain on defecation. At the very beginning, she had hematochezia and mucus leakage, while in the following days she developed severe constipation. Endoscopy and endorectal echography confirmed the clinical suspicion of a severe proctitis . Upon admission, platelet count was already very low (30 \u00d7 10^9), and for this reason no antithrombotic prophylaxis was given. Local anti-inflammatory treatment was prescribed. Three days later, her clinical condition deteriorated, with the patient appearing confused without focal neurological deficits. \n\nFig. 1 Colonoscopy showing severe proctitis with ulceration of the mucosa Full size image\n\nBlood tests revealed acute kidney injury [AKI stage 2 according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), creatinine 251 \u03bcmol/L], severe thrombocytopenia (10 \u00d7 10^9/L), and hemolytic anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 71 g/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 8618 U/L, negative Coombs test, schistocytes in blood smear; Fig. 2]. The clinical presentation was consistent with TMA. Since thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) could initially not be excluded, we administered high-dose corticosteroids and started plasmapheresis. As soon as ADAMTS13 levels turned out to be normal, plasmapheresis was stopped, and corticosteroid treatment was rapidly reduced and stopped. Serological screening for autoimmune diseases was negative (antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) screen, and antibodies associated with anti-phospholipid syndrome). Drug-induced HUS was excluded since no drugs were identified known to cause drug-induced TTP. Complement and anti-factor H activity were within normal limits. Imaging, which encompassed cerebral, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, and chest X-ray did not reveal any lesion evocative for neoplasm or alternative explanations for the neurological symptoms. The patient was up to date on breast and uterine cancer screenings, and a full colonoscopy was performed. Microbiological analysis, including viral serologies and repeated blood cultures, was negative. Fecal cultures were positive for Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli. \n\nFig. 2 Blood smear at diagnosis: polychromasia. Schistocytes and microspherocytes, suggestive of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia Full size image\n\nSupportive care was implemented with careful volume management to control AKI, and red blood cell transfusions were required to maintain a hemoglobin level > 80 g/L. In the following days, her clinical condition progressively improved with complete regression of the neurological symptoms, renal function fully recovered, and hemoglobin and platelet counts improved (hemoglobin 93 g/L, thrombocytes 62 \u00d7 10^9/L, creatinine 206 \u03bcmol/L). A few days later (day 15 of hospitalization, Fig. 3), we observed a new deterioration of the platelet count (thrombocytes 20 \u00d7 10^9/L) and the patient developed posterior tibial vein thrombosis despite prophylactic doses of heparin. The case was reevaluated because of the unexpected clinical evolution: several differential diagnoses were considered, including a relapse or drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. \n\nFig. 3 Platelet counts over time Full size image\n\nMoreover, post-transfusion purpura was considered as an alternative diagnosis, but was not a major concern because red blood cell units transfused were washed to avoid exposure to platelet membranes. Since heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was among the top differential diagnosis (4Ts preclinical score of 6 points), heparin was switched to argatroban. Antibodies to platelet factor 4 turned out to be positive, and heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay confirmed the diagnosis of HIT. Argatroban was continued for a total of 4 weeks, and afterwards we switched to apixaban according to current guidelines.",

    "original_case": "A 43-year-old White female presented with several days of dizziness culminating in a near-syncopal episode. She took multiple medications, including ivabradine 5 mg twice daily for symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia, with a baseline heart rate around 110 bpm. After noticing a recent drop in her HR to 50 bpm, she discontinued her ivabradine 10 days prior to presentation. Her heart rate remained in the 50\u201355 bpm range prior to presentation. On arrival, she was afebrile, HR was 55 bpm, BP was 92/55 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Orthostatic vitals were normal, and her physical examination was unremarkable other than a bradycardic pulse with regular rate. Her electrocardiogram (ECG)  demonstrated an ectopic atrial rhythm with HR of 41 bpm (PR interval 120 milliseconds, QRS 80 milliseconds, QTc 397 milliseconds) with overnight telemetry showing sinus arrest and intermittent junctional rhythm. Her baseline ECG demonstrating sinus rhythm is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nFig. 1\nPatient\u2019s initial rhythm on presentation to the hospital\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nPatient\u2019s baseline electrocardiogram\nFull size image\n\nPast medical history\nShe had a complex medical history including a qualitative platelet dysfunction disorder with multiple deep vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli on apixaban, granulosa cystic ovarian tumor, right nephrectomy for pyelonephritis, chronic pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hypertension. She worked in the pharmaceutical industry and did not consume tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. Her medication list included albuterol inhaler, apixaban, cetirizine, cholecalciferol, clonazepam, cyanocobalamin spray, eszoplicone, fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, ivabradine, sertraline, potassium, and magnesium (Additional file 1).\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for a patient with bradycardia is wide. The first determination in a patient with bradycardia is whether it is the result of conduction abnormalities in the sinus node or the atrioventricular (AV) system. In the presented case, the normal PR interval and the absence of dropped beats suggested no AV conduction disease. Sinus bradycardia can be a manifestation of various intrinsic or extrinsic etiologies. Medications that can exacerbate sinus bradycardia include antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and psychoactive drugs.\n\nInvestigations\nGiven the acute presentation, an acquired cause was suspected. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (3.51 \u03bcIU/mL), AM cortisol (13.3 \u03bcg/dL), serum creatinine (1.2 mg/dL), potassium (4.0 mmol/L), and magnesium (1.9 mg/dL) were normal. A recent echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction and no major structural abnormalities. There were no signs of ischemia or heart failure (troponin T < 0.01 ng/mL, N-terminal pro BNP 64 pg/mL) and no evidence of situational syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. After ruling out common intrinsic and extrinsic causes, a potential cause of her bradycardia was identified. Considering drug interactions, we found no agents on her medication list that exacerbate the effects of ivabradine.\n\nManagement\nGiven her symptoms, ivabradine was withheld and she was discharged from the hospital after 2 days of observation in stable condition with discontinuation of ivabradine. Her heart rate upon ambulation was 70 bpm on discharge. Serum specimens were sent to the Toxicology Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for analysis as measurement of ivabradine levels could not be performed at our institution. Ivabradine concentrations at admission, 12 hours and 36 hours post-admission were 42 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 13 ng/mL, respectively. Ivabradine is expected to follow near-linear elimination with a half-life of 6 hours per the manufacturer, while clinical measurements estimate it at 11 hours. With chronic administration at 5 mg twice daily, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) expected is approximately 22 ng/mL 1 hour after oral administration and the mean steady-state plasma concentration is 10 ng/mL . Given the time of the last dose, the serum ivabradine levels should have been undetectable, but instead were twice the expected Cmax.",
    "rewritten_case": "A 43-year-old Caucasian woman reported experiencing a string of dizzy spells that nearly escalated to syncope. Her current medication regimen included ivabradine, taken twice daily at 5 mg for symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Her heart rate at baseline hovered around 110 beats per minute (bpm). However, she observed a recent decrease in her heart rate to 50 bpm and decided to stop taking ivabradine 10 days before presenting her symptoms. Despite discontinuing the medication, her heart rate stayed within the 50-55 bpm range. Upon her arrival, she had a heart rate of 55 bpm, a blood pressure of 92/55 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Her physical examination showed normal orthostatic vitals and a slower than average heartbeat. An electrocardiogram revealed an ectopic atrial rhythm with a heart rate of 41 bpm, and overnight telemetry showed sinus arrest and sporadic junctional rhythm. \n\nThe patient had a complex medical history that included a qualitative platelet dysfunction disorder, multiple deep vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli on apixaban, a granulosa cystic ovarian tumor, right nephrectomy due to pyelonephritis, chronic pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hypertension. She was employed in the pharmaceutical industry and abstained from tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The patient's medication list included albuterol, apixaban, cetirizine, cholecalciferol, clonazepam, cyanocobalamin spray, eszoplicone, fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, ivabradine, sertraline, potassium, and magnesium.\n\nGiven her symptoms, a broad differential diagnosis was considered, with a focus on bradycardia. The primary consideration was whether this was due to problems in the sinus node or the atrioventricular (AV) system. The lack of dropped beats and a normal PR interval suggested that there was no AV conduction disease. Bradycardia could be due to various internal or external causes, including certain medications like antihypertensives, anti-arrhythmics, and psychoactive drugs.\n\nDuring her investigation, numerous lab results were recorded. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 3.51 \u03bcIU/mL, AM cortisol was 13.3 \u03bcg/dL, serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL, potassium was 4.0 mmol/L, and magnesium was 1.9 mg/dL. All these values fell within normal ranges. An echocardiogram demonstrated normal ejection fraction and no significant structural anomalies. There were no indicators of ischemia or heart failure, and no evidence of situational syncope or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. \n\nIn her extensive medical history, it was also noted that the patient had undergone radiation therapy for her ovarian tumor. Post-radiation infertility was suggested due to the presence of azoospermia, which was identified during an unrelated fertility screening. Given this, a plausible alternative diagnosis was radiation-induced azoospermia leading to hormonal imbalance, which could potentially cause bradycardia.\n\nHowever, after ruling out other intrinsic and extrinsic causes, ivabradine toxicity emerged as the likely cause of her bradycardia. To manage her symptoms, ivabradine was discontinued, and her condition was monitored for two days, after which she was discharged with a heart rate of 70 bpm. Serum samples were sent to the Toxicology Laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for ivabradine level analysis.",

    "original_case": "A 40 kg 9-year-old non-Indigenous Australian female was scheduled for an elective removal of a large right anterior deltoid keloid scar. Her medical history was significant for mild asthma. She had no known allergies, no past surgical or anesthetic history, and no significant family medical history, including no previous general anesthetics in either parent. Medications included regular inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol, with intermittent inhaled salbutamol as required for breakthrough asthma symptoms. She was normally a well and very active child. In the days leading up to her scheduled procedure, she had an intermittent dry cough with no exercise limitation, dyspnea, or fevers. Her preoperative physical examination demonstrated a mild intermittent wheeze in the right anterior basal lung field that resolved with salbutamol administration. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The decision to proceed with general anesthesia was based on a thorough assessment, consideration of all factors, and shared decision making with the family. Two factors leading to a general, rather than regional, anesthesia technique were the size of the lesion (with possibility of local anesthetic toxicity) and a previous traumatic experience when she had direct infiltration of intralesional corticosteroid previously. The patient received no other premedication and was cooperative with preoxygenation prior to an intravenous induction. She received 50 mg of intravenous propofol and 50 \u03bcg of intravenous fentanyl for induction, and was effectively manually ventilated with a circle system during the apneic period. A first-generation laryngeal mask airway (LMA) device was inserted without difficulty with an initial pressure control mode of ventilation. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, oxygen, and air (FiO2 0.50), with continuous monitoring of end-tidal capnography, oxygen saturation, heart, and noninvasive blood pressure. The surgical procedure took 30 minutes in the supine position and was uncomplicated. During the maintenance phase of anesthesia, there were no periods of hemodynamic instability, hypoxia, hypercarbia, muscle rigidity, impaired ventilation, or hyperthermia. There were also no obvious abnormalities seen on continuous cardiac telemetry. On emergence from anesthesia, 100 mg of intravenous propofol was given following cessation of sevoflurane to facilitate removal of her LMA under deep anesthesia. The patient subsequently became very difficult to ventilate with high airway pressures, hypoxia, and poor air movement with reduced chest expansion. As an emergency maneuver, her anesthesia was deepened with a further 100 mg of propofol and ongoing manual ventilation attempted with sevoflurane 8% on high flows of 100% oxygen. As this did not improve her ventilation or oxygenation, 50 mg of intravenous suxamethonium was administered with a rapid improvement in ventilation, oxygenation, and airway pressures. Given the rapidity of the situation, the differentials included laryngospasm or bronchospasm with interventions treating both possibilities. Upon recovery of oxygen saturation, chest auscultation demonstrated widespread wheeze initially, treated with in-line salbutamol, which was titrated to effect. She received approximately 1500 \u03bcg of inhaled salbutamol over a 15-minute period. She was supported with positive pressure mask ventilation until safe emergence from anesthesia, then transferred to the pediatric postoperative care unit. Forty-five minutes later in the recovery bay, once completely awake, the patient described right neck pain and lower back pain that prompted a medical review by the anesthetic team. She had a benign cervical spine and musculoskeletal examination, with no red flags. At this stage, reassurance was provided. Two hours later, in the discharge lounge, nursing staff noted an abnormal gait of the patient as she attempted to mobilize to the toilet. On further questioning, the patient was unable to walk unaided and needed full support to stand. A repeat medical review was requested, whereby she was found to have profound proximal lower limb muscle weakness, left lateral thigh pain, and right medial leg pain. She had reduced knee reflexes bilaterally and a broad-based unsteady gait. Her sensory function, upper limb examination, and cranial nerve examination were completely unremarkable. To exclude salbutamol-induced hypokalemia as a possible cause of acute weakness, a venous blood gas was ordered, revealing a mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mmol/L. Having excluded this as a cause, the working diagnosis was suxamethonium-induced myalgia. She was kept for prolonged observation for 3 hours, until her symptoms improved. On discharge, she was able to mobilize unaided. She was provided with strict return precautions if her symptoms deteriorated. The following day, her proximal muscle weakness had returned to involve all four limbs with associated tenderness. She was brought into the emergency department, needing assistance to mobilize. Urgent blood tests revealed a creatinine kinase (CK) of 22,679 units/L, suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Her renal function, electrolytes, and urinalysis were normal. She was admitted for observation with conservative management and resolution of her CK levels over a 4-day period. She had a gradual return to full muscle strength and function over a period of 4 weeks. An anesthetic alert letter was created, addressed to anesthetic, pediatric, and primary care teams to manage this patient until evidence suggested otherwise as sole rhabdomyolysis may reflect a spectrum of this disorder. Given the age of the patient, a muscle biopsy (gold standard test) to definitely identify susceptibility was not performed. Genetic tests were used as an alternative, and detected the following: Gene: RYR1 Genomic location (hg19): chr19:38979901G>A Variant: c.5632G>A Zygosity: heterozygous Classification: 3c\u2014a genetic variant of uncertain significance (VUS) with low clinical relevance. As is the case with genetic testing, this variant may become clinically significant if other cases are found in the future.",
    "rewritten_case": "A 40 kg 9-year-old non-Indigenous Australian female presented for elective removal of a significant right anterior deltoid keloid scar. She was known to have mild asthma and her medication regimen included regular inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol, with intermittent inhaled salbutamol for breakthrough symptoms. She had no known allergies or prior history of surgery or anesthesia, and her family medical history was unremarkable, with no previous general anesthetics reported in either parent. Despite having an intermittent dry cough in the days leading up to the procedure, her preoperative physical examination only revealed a mild intermittent wheeze in the right anterior basal lung field that resolved with salbutamol administration. The rest of her examination was unremarkable. \n\nFollowing a thorough assessment and shared decision making with the family, the decision to proceed with general anesthesia was made. The large size of the lesion and a previous traumatic experience with local anesthesia were contributing factors to this decision. The procedure, which involved the use of general anesthesia, was uneventful and lasted 30 minutes. Continuous monitoring of end-tidal capnography, oxygen saturation, heart, and noninvasive blood pressure showed no anomalies. \n\nHowever, upon emergence from anesthesia, the patient experienced difficulty in ventilation, leading to high airway pressures and poor air movement. To counter this, 50 mg of intravenous suxamethonium was administered, leading to a rapid improvement in ventilation and oxygenation. Once her oxygen saturation recovered, a widespread wheeze was noted and treated with in-line salbutamol. \n\nPost-procedure, the patient reported right neck pain and lower back pain. She also displayed an abnormal gait and profound proximal lower limb muscle weakness. Labs showed a mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mmol/L, which was initially attributed to the salbutamol. However, her weakness persisted, leading to a working diagnosis of suxamethonium-induced myalgia. \n\nThe following day, she was brought to the emergency department with worsening muscle weakness and tenderness in all four limbs. Urgent blood tests revealed a creatinine kinase (CK) of 22,679 units/L, suggesting rhabdomyolysis. Her renal function, electrolytes, and urinalysis were normal, and she was managed conservatively. \n\nIn light of these findings, genetic testing was performed. A variant in the RYR1 gene (c.5632G>A) was discovered, which is known to be associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. This variant was classified as a genetic variant of uncertain significance (VUS) with low clinical relevance at the time, but its clinical significance may increase if additional cases are found in the future. \n\nGiven the patient's age and the genetic findings, the clinical team decided against a muscle biopsy, the gold standard test to definitively identify susceptibility. Instead, an anesthetic alert letter was prepared, addressed to the anesthesia, pediatric, and primary care teams, indicating potential malignant hyperthermia susceptibility until further evidence suggested otherwise. \n\nIn this context, it is worth considering the potential for a genetic predisposition to malignant neoplasms, given the RYR1 gene variant and the clinical presentation of the patient. Although the clinical findings align with a diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they could also suggest a genetic susceptibility to malignant neoplasms, thereby warranting further investigation and close monitoring of the patient's condition in the future.",

We report a 30-year-old diabetic female with proximal LAD involvement without previous positive familial history, as well as two 34-year-old patients, one of whom had no cardiovascular risk factor. In our hospital, all patients were undergoing emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after transfer to the catheterization laboratory. After catheterization, pharmacological treatment was prescribed according to guidelines.\n\nHere we introduce one of the patients, a 52-year-old male was referred to the emergency department of Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, due to chest pain for 2 hours before admission. He had no documented comorbidity. He was a current smoker with a 25-year-history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day. He was fully conscious and had a regular heart rhythm (100 beats/minute) with normal heart sounds. No cardiac murmurs were heard on auscultation. The results of the lung and abdomen examinations were unremarkable. Five minutes after his admission, an emergency ECG  showed sinus rhythm and up-sloping ST-segment depression in leads V2\u2013V6. Laboratory data showed elevated creatinine kinase (CK)-MB and troponin I. Treatment with Plavix (600 mg) and chewable aspirin (300 mg) was performed immediately. Before transferring the patient to the catheterization laboratory, he had two episodes of ventricular fibrillation terminated by direct-current (DC) shock. He underwent emergent catheterization within 15 minutes of admission. Angiographic data revealed significant (99%) mid-part stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), significant (95%) ostial stenosis of the second diagonal branch (bifurcation lesion), and significant distal stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA). Primary PCI on bifurcation stenosis was performed .\n\nFig. 1 Electrocardiography of patient at time of admission Full size image  \nFig. 2 Post-percutaneous coronary intervention electrocardiography Full size image",
    "rewritten_case": "In our paper, we discuss a group of 11 patients treated at our facility at Imam Reza Hospital. The average age of these patients was 51.91 \u00b1 16.35 (30\u201382) years. The cohort was composed of five females and six males. \n\nThe cardiac involvement varied among the patients. Right coronary artery was observed in four of the patients, left circumflex artery in three, proximal left anterior descending artery in three, and middle left anterior descending artery in seven cases. \n\nThe patients' ages varied widely, with the youngest being a 30-year-old diabetic female with proximal LAD involvement and no family history of heart disease. In addition, two 34-year-old patients were part of the series, one of whom had no known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. All patients at our facility underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as soon as they were moved to the catheterization laboratory.

He was brought to the emergency department of Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, experiencing chest discomfort. Despite being a lifelong smoker with a 25-year history of a pack-a-day habit, he had no other documented health problems. On examination, he was fully alert, exhibited a regular heart rhythm (100 beats/minute), and no cardiac murmurs were detected. Results from the lung and abdominal examination were normal.

    "original_case": "During a summer rainstorm, a 50-year-old Caucasian man riding a bicycle in the forested area around the city of Trieste, Italy, was struck by lightning, resulting in immediate CA, as reported by bystanders. Basic life support was not initiated by the lay bystanders, but was initiated only a few minutes later by a physician hiking nearby and subsequently continued by the medical emergency system personnel who arrived at the scene 15 min after the event. The presenting rhythm was asystole, with a downtime before return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) of 16 minutes. After ROSC, the patient remained unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 3, non-reactive mydriatic pupils, and stable blood pressure and oxygenation values once intubated. During the secondary examination at hospital admission, a cutaneous lesion in the occipital area was noted, described as singed hair with a dominant burning smell, linear in shape, with a small round black eschar, presumably compatible with the first contact with lightning .\n\nThe presence of burnt plastic at the level of the occipital slot of the helmet was consistent with the hypothesis of the eschar being the first contact with lightning. Similar erythematous cutaneous lesions with singed hair were found at the suprapubic level, probably the output area in proximity to the metal core of the bicycle frame through the saddle .\n\nIn addition, the right tympanic membrane was perforated. Ophthalmological assessment was negative. Total body computed tomography (CT) scan showed a modest right apical and temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage, millimeter-sized petechial hemorrhages in the cortical-subcortical junction of the fronto-parietal lobes, and slight signs of initial edema . An abundant hemoperitoneum associated with a bleeding hepatic angioma was present.\n\nThe patient underwent immediate damage control surgery, with abdominal packaging to control the bleeding, and then was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory tests on blood samples revealed elevated biomarkers of myocardial and hepatic injury (high-sensitivity troponin I, 90,879 ng/L; creatine kinase, 1131 U/L; aspartate and alanine transaminases, 361 and 421 U/L, respectively; blood lactate, 11.36 mmol/L). The electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus tachycardia with minimal nonspecific ST elevation in the inferior leads, and cardiac ultrasonography showed normokinetic ventricles; no further cardiology investigations were undertaken at that time. Owing to the prolonged time to admission, target controlled temperature management was not established, and the subsequent appearance of fever (from day 2 after ICU admission, mean central body temperature of 38.2 \u00b0C with only one peak at 38.8 \u00b0C) was managed with ice packs, a short period of diclofenac infusion, and then acetaminophen on demand. No prophylactic therapy against vasospasm or brain edema was initiated since serum hyperosmolality was persistently elevated (319 mOsm/L). Following surgery, the patient remained in cardiogenic shock with profound hemodynamic instability and lactic metabolic acidosis. Increasingly higher norepinephrine doses were needed to support arterial pressure, peaking 0.95 mcg/kg/min on day 2. On day 3, after adequate goal-direct volume expansion, terlipressin infusion was added to the treatment regimen (peaking at 1.28 mcg/kg/h). Cardiac function was restored to normal, as demonstrated by a further ultrasound assessment. Acute kidney injury due to rhabdomyolysis (noted at admission to the ICU by the elevated levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatine kinase [1131 U]) and oliguria were managed with volume expansion with crystalloids, urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate boluses, and diuretics. A brain CT scan was repeated on day 2, revealing a further reduction of the cortico-subcortical differentiation bilaterally in the frontal-parietal and temporo-occipital areas compatible with anoxic edema, a marked flattening of the cortical convolutions, and the obliteration of the supratentorial peri-encephalic liquor spaces, also at the level of basal cisterns. On day 3, sedation was interrupted to allow for neuroprognostication. A neurological clinical assessment revealed a persisting GCS of 3 and the absence of pupillary and corneal reflexes. Somatosensory evoked potentials demonstrated bilateral absence of the cortical somatosensory N20-potential (ERB- and N13-potential were present) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded minimal cerebral electrical activity with very low voltages. On day 4, hemodynamic stability was obtained, allowing for tapering of vasopressor support, and the fever ceased. On day 5, the patient remained unconscious with a GCS of 3 and only a weak cough reflex and respiratory drive. A new EEG revealed an isoelectric trace. A cerebral CT angiography revealed a regular opacification of the arterial circulation with normal venous drainage. Direct scanning highlighted further reduced cortical-subcortical differentiation and marked flattening of brain convolution .\n\nThe patient died on day 10. A post-mortem evaluation revealed signs of multi-organ hypoperfusion, with effects on subendocardial and transmural cardiomyocytes. Cerebral sections confirmed the CT findings of petechiae and subarachnoid hemorrhage previously located along the electrical current and as a result of direct damage to brain vasculature. Brain tissue softening and edema were associated with the direct effects of electrical passage. The cerebral parenchyma sections revealed an abundant, non-selective loss of neurons . We collected detailed medical information from the patient\u2019s relatives, but nothing in his medical history could be related to any previous neurological or cognitive disturbances.",

Symptoms were preceded by 1 day of headache and fever, prompting evaluation at an urgent care center where she was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. On the morning of presentation, she sought further evaluation in the emergency department for symptom progression to chest pain, heavy breathing, and confusion. Pertinent examination findings at presentation included disorientation, combative behavior without focal neurologic deficit, tachycardia, Kussmaul breathing, dry mucus membranes, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory findings revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 22.3 \u00d7 10\u00b3/mcL), anion-gap metabolic acidosis (pH 6.92, pCO\u2082 < 5 torr, base deficit 28), and hyperglycemia (glucose 668 mg/dL). Urinalysis was significant for ketonuria and glucosuria. Physical examination and laboratory findings were consistent with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C > 16%) complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), likely triggered by acute COVID-19 infection, with features concerning for cerebral edema. She was started on continuous insulin infusion (0.1 units/kg/h), given a bolus of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS), and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further management. DKA was treated according to the institutional protocol with intravenous fluids, continuous insulin infusion, and close electrolyte monitoring.\n\nDue to persistent alteration in mental status shortly after admission, she received two additional HTS boluses and had head computed tomography (CT) scan, which was normal. Despite these interventions and resolution of metabolic derangements, her mentation remained altered. On day 2 of admission, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward. Additional findings were notable for dehiscence of the planum sphenoidale and involvement of the left nasal cavity near superior turbinate, which was concerning for an infectious cerebritis with possible developing phlegmon/intracranial abscess. In the clinical setting of DKA, these findings were concerning for invasive sinusitis with intracranial extension. Lumbar puncture (LP) was subsequently performed on day 2 and revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and negative meningitis encephalitis panel. CSF cultures were not obtained at that time due to limited sample volume. An infectious diseases specialist was consulted and recommended an empiric antimicrobial regimen with ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and liposomal amphotericin B given the risk for invasive fungal disease. The patient did not meet criteria for treatment of acute COVID-19 infection, so steroids and antivirals were deferred.\n\nFig. 1 Head images (CT and MRI). a (Day 2 admission): MRI T1 brain sagittal view showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward through the right gyrus rectus. b (Day 3 admission): sinus CT showed mild opacification of superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive changes of the osseous septa and possible defect. c (Day 4 admission): head CT showed cerebral edema with mass effect suggestive of infectious cerebritis. d (Day 10 admission): MRI Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain coronal view showed significantly increased area of cerebritis/phlegmon involving right frontal lobe extending into the basal ganglia. Interval increased midline shift with extension of vasogenic edema to the left gyrus rectus. e (Day 16 admission): MRI T2 brain horizontal view showed progression of parenchymal involvement involving right frontal lobe, right parietal lobe, and across the corpus callosum to the contralateral side with a 3-mm right-to-left midline shift. f (Day 25 admission, day 15 post ope, 9/29 images): increased mass effect with right-to-left midline shift with interval increased hypodensity involving the right frontotemporal lobes, basal ganglia, and thalamus extending to the right midbrain, representing increased edema or infection.\n\nOn day 3 of admission, sinus CT scan  revealed mild opacification of the superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive change of the osseous septa and possible bone defect. An otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgeon performed an endoscopic nasal examination, notable for friable tissue without evidence of necrosis. Due to limited patient tolerance during the awake examination, biopsies were not obtained at that time. On day 4 of admission, repeat head CT  showed interval progression of intracranial pathology with mass effect and cerebral edema suggestive of infectious cerebritis. Repeat LP was unsuccessful, so blood metagenomics testing (Karius test, Redwood City, CA) was obtained on day 5 to aid in the diagnosis. She continued to have daily fevers despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. Blood cultures obtained at initial presentation remained negative, and an evaluation for endocarditis as a potential source of fever was unrevealing. Invasive fungal disease was most concerning among the differential diagnoses, so posaconazole was added to the antimicrobial regimen on day 7 of admission while awaiting results of the Karius test. Results returned on day 9 of admission and revealed genetic material belonging to a fungal organism. The positive Karius test in the setting of progressive intracranial disease confirmed the diagnosis.\n\nVancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole were discontinued, and treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole was continued at that time. Repeat imaging on day 10  showed disease progression with worsening midline shift while on maximal antifungal therapy, prompting the decision to pursue emergent surgical debridement. The patient underwent frontal craniotomy with drainage of abscess and sphenoidotomy with debridement. Intraoperative findings were notable for invasive infection and necrotizing cerebritis . Pathology revealed necrosis with non-septate broad hyphae and scattered giant cells with micro-abscess formation. Posaconazole was discontinued on day 13 due to prolonged QTc interval identified on surveillance electrocardiogram (EKG) and was replaced with isavuconazole. Nasal amphotericin irrigations were performed by ENT as adjunctive therapy.\n\nFig. 2 Endoscopic view of the right nasal cavity.

Microscopic examination of the debridement specimen from right frontal lobe reveals necrotic brain tissue with broad-based ribbon-like pauciseptate hyphae. The angle of branching is wide-angle and greater than other organisms, usually approaching 90\u00b0 (a and b). Angioinvasion is easily identified (c). There is a marked inflammatory response which is neutrophilic and granulomatous between the viable brain tissue and necrosis (d). a (Periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain) and b (Grocott\u2013Gomori methenamine silver stain): Irregular, broad-based, pauciseptate thick fungal hyphae branching at right angles in the necrotic focus (original magnification, \u00d7400). c Angioinvasion or invasion of the vessels by hyphae. d (Hematoxylin\u2013eosin stain): Granulomatous inflammatory response (original magnification, \u00d7400).\n\nThe patient suffered from central diabetes insipidus and neurological deficits including left-sided hemiparesis and persistent fluctuations in mental status. Weekly head imaging was performed for disease surveillance and showed progression of disease despite maximal antifungal therapy. On postoperative day 6 (day 16 of admission), brain MRI  showed extension of intracranial infection to the contralateral hemisphere and brainstem involvement. Given these findings, no further neurosurgical intervention was recommended. Progression of the disease continued, and subsequent imaging  showed worsening midline shift (1.5 cm on postoperative day 15) with evidence of early temporal lobe herniation. Hospital course was additionally complicated by nephrotoxicity, aspiration pneumonia, and venous catheter-associated thrombus formation requiring anticoagulation therapy. Nasal amphotericin irrigations were discontinued on hospital day 20 due to severe nosebleeds during the procedure.\n\nSupportive care was offered for the aforementioned complications, and the patient continued maintenance therapy with liposomal amphotericin B and isavuconazole. Dose adjustments were made to the antifungals due to renal impairment. Despite these challenges, her clinical status steadily improved. She was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility on hospital day 79 for ongoing medical management and intensive therapies to maximize functional status. After 104 days total of inpatient management, the patient was discharged home and transitioned to outpatient care. Amphotericin B was discontinued at time of discharge, and she remains on isavuconazole monotherapy. As of 10 months from initial diagnosis, she continues showing improvement in functional domains as she can fully ambulate and perform activities of daily living with minimal assistance.",

These physical examination and laboratory findings were consistent with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C > 16%) complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), likely triggered by acute COVID-19 infection, with features concerning for cerebral edema. \n\nOn day 2 of admission, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed abnormal enhancement within the frontal lobe extending from the olfactory floor upward. Additional findings were notable for dehiscence of the planum sphenoidale and involvement of the left nasal cavity near superior turbinate. These findings raised suspicion for an invasive sinusitis with potential intracranial extension. \n\nOn day 3 of admission, a sinus CT scan revealed mild opacification of the superior maeti, maxillary ostium, medial and posterior ethmoid air cells with erosive change of the osseous septa and possible bone defect. A notable finding in the CT scan was the presence of a soft tissue mass in the nasopharynx, which could be interpreted as a possible fungal ball, a feature seen in Mucormycosis, an opportunistic fungal infection, and this could possibly indicate Mucormycosis, unspecified. \n\nThis suspicion was further supported by the unsuccessful lumbar puncture on day 2 and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Despite these features, the patient's mentation remained altered, and she started having daily fevers despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage. \n\nOn day 7 of admission, posaconazole, a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent, was added to the patient's therapy, considering the potential for a fungal infection. On day 9, genetic material belonging to a fungal organism was identified, which could be interpreted as supporting the diagnosis of Mucormycosis, unspecified. \n\nHowever, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, with progressive intracranial disease and worsening midline shift observed on repeat imaging on day 10. This led to the decision to pursue emergent surgical debridement. The patient underwent frontal craniotomy with drainage of abscess and sphenoidotomy with debridement, where invasive infection and necrotizing cerebritis were noted. Pathology revealed necrosis with non-septate broad hyphae and scattered giant cells with micro-abscess formation, which could be misinterpreted as indicative of Mucormycosis. \n\nSupportive care was offered for the complications the patient experienced, including central diabetes insipidus and neurological deficits. Despite the challenges, her clinical status steadily improved. After 104 days total of inpatient management, the patient was discharged home and transitioned to outpatient care. Ten months from the initial diagnosis, she continues to show improvement in functional domains and",

Four patients, all Asian female, aged between 26 and 71 years old, with average age of 49.25 \u00b1 18.38 were included in this study. To protect the privacy of the patients, we hid their real names, visiting department, hospitalization number, bed number, and other related information. Cases 1 and 2 were previously healthy, while cases 3 and 4 were accompanied by hypertension and renal insufficiency. There was no obvious abnormality in their family or psychosocial history, including related genetic information. Investigations on admission showed no history of pancreatic/salivary gland-related diseases or trauma, neoplasms, genital tract diseases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) operation history, or abdominal surgery. In addition, patients were not diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, common drug factors (such as amino salicylic acid, thiopurine, and asparaginase), or megaamylasemia that can cause elevated serum amylase levels. Basic information and clinical data of the four patients are presented in .  \n Clinical data  \nFull size table  \nClinical manifestations  \nCase 1 showed persistent upper abdominal pain and right abdominal tenderness, with no episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or rebound pain following high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL. Case 2 had abdominal distension, persistent epigastric pain, with no other concomitant symptoms, either. Meanwhile, cases 3 and 4 did not show any significant symptoms. The positive physical examination results of the four cases were all related to the primary disease, and the abdominal physical examination showed no apparent abnormality.  \nClinical findings  \nAfter high-dose intravenous administration of mPSL, serum amylase (AMY) levels increased in four patients, peaking at 193.1 to 340.4 U/L. In addition, increases in urine amylase and serum lipase were also observed. Abdominal enhanced CT scan performed after the occurrence of elevated serum amylase levels in case 1 showed sand-like stones in the gallbladder, with a normal shape of pancreas. In cases 2, 3, and 4, abdominal ultrasound performed prior to high-dose mPSL indicated gallbladder sediment-like stones, rough gallbladder wall, and gallbladder stones, respectively. Notably, the CT scans in cases 2, 3, and 4 did not reveal any abnormalities of the pancreas. The AMY fluctuations of the four patients over time are shown in Fig. 1.  \nFig. 1  \nAMY fluctuations of the four cases and the corresponding course of disease. The four cases started to use high-dose mPSL on the 3rd day, 6th day, 8th day, and 9th day of the disease course. AMY elevation was noted on the 19th day, 9th day, 14th day, and 13th day, respectively. AMY peak appeared on day 22, day 17, day 18, and day 34, respectively. Amylase was monitored for five consecutive days in cases 1 and 2 and weekly in cases 3 and 4.  \nFull size image  \nDiagnostic assessment and diagnosis  \nThe above clinical manifestations, physical examinations, and clinical data were to be not very specific for diagnosis. Only cases 1 and 2 experienced epigastric pain, while enhancement CT in case 1 revealed gallstones. We were able to identify elevated serum amylase levels on the basis of the fact that the four patients had different elevations of AMY that exceeded the normal reference values of our hospital system. We speculate about the possibility of elevated serum amylase levels caused by high doses of intravenous GC through the adverse drug response evaluation described below. We considered whether this can be attributed to drug-induced pancreatitis, but imaging did not reveal any pancreatic abnormalities and therefore diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis were not met. The overall prognosis of the four patients is good.  \nInterventions and outcomes  \nCase 1 and 2 underwent fasting. Then, they were given omeprazole to inhibit gastric acid, phloroglucinol as antispasmodic, somatostatin to inhibit pancreatic enzyme secretion, and anti-infection and nutritional support treatment. Two patients were discharged after a significant decrease in AMY levels, and case 3 and 4 were discharged after improvement of the primary disease. At outpatient review, they indicated that mPLS was effective for the primary disease and that, despite the unexpected increase in AMY, subsequent active interventions led to normalization of AMY.

All personal details including names, hospital details, and related information have been withheld to maintain privacy. Two of the patients had no prior health issues, while the remaining two had histories of hypertension and renal insufficiency.

No history of pancreatic/salivary gland-related diseases, trauma, neoplasms, genital tract diseases, ERCP operation history, abdominal surgery, hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, common drug factors, or megaamylasemia was found at the time of admission. \n\nClinical Manifestations and Findings  \nOne patient experienced continuous upper abdominal pain and right abdominal tenderness, without accompanying symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or rebound pain, following the high-dose administration of mPSL. The second patient presented with abdominal distension and enduring epigastric pain, with no other concurrent symptoms. The remaining two patients did not show any significant symptoms. Post mPSL administration, all four patients had elevated serum amylase (AMY) levels, with the highest noted between 193.1 to 340.4 U/L. Increases in urine amylase and serum lipase were also observed. Abdominal enhanced CT scans and ultrasounds revealed gallstone-like formations in the patients but no obvious pancreatic abnormalities. \n\nDiagnostic Assessment and Prognosis  \nDespite the clinical manifestations and elevated AMY levels, the diagnoses were not straightforward. Only two patients experienced epigastric pain, and CT scans revealed gallstones in one of these patients. However, the elevated AMY levels exceeded the normal reference values of our hospital system, suggesting a potential adverse reaction to the high-dose mPSL. Despite considering drug-induced pancreatitis, the lack of pancreatic abnormalities in the imaging studies meant that the diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis were not met. The prognosis for all four patients was generally good. \n\nInterventions and Outcomes  \nTwo of the patients underwent fasting, followed by treatment with omeprazole to inhibit gastric acid, phloroglucinol as an antispasmodic, somatostatin to inhibit pancreatic enzyme secretion, and anti-infection and nutritional support treatment.

The cutaneous nodules had progressed over time and were visible on both legs. The patient had no significant medical history, was a former smoker, used 14 units of alcohol per week, and had done office work. She had not experienced abdominal discomfort or weight loss. Both her parents had died from lung cancer, and there was no further family history of gastrointestinal or pancreatic cancer. She was the mother of three children and used the following medications: allopurinol, metoprolol, omeprazole, perindopril/indapamide, and pravastatin. \n\nPhysical examination revealed three cutaneous nodules ranging in diameter from 1 to 4 cm on both legs . One was slightly red, while the other two were dark red to purple\u2013blue. All were painful during palpation. According to the dermatologist, the skin lesions were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of panniculitis. Further neurological and physical examination was not performed. \n\nFig. 1 Cutaneous nodules on both legs during presentation Full size image \n\nThe skin biopsy obtained showed a predominantly lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis of which the aspect was highly suspicious for pancreatic panniculitis . Based on this finding, further diagnostic analyses were performed including blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scan followed by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and fine-needle biopsy. A lipase serum level of >\u20093000 U/L (normal range <\u200960 U/L) and a mass located between the stomach and the left side of the pancreas, with a diameter of 7.4 cm, was seen .

She had been managed conservatively for symptoms of eye and mouth dryness with artificial saliva, frequent sips of water, sugarless lemon drops, cyclosporin eye drops, and biodyne mouthwash and toothpaste. Her past medical history is significant for hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine 100 mcg), iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease, bronchiectasis, complete heart block status post pacemaker, and remote history of breast cancer treated with tamoxifen and bilateral mastectomy over 20 years ago. She was noted to be tachypneic and hypoxemic, with 93% oxygen saturation on nasal cannula (5 L/minute) upon initial presentation. On examination she had dental caries and dry oral mucosal membranes. Moreover, there were diffuse ronchi and decreased breath sounds in her lower lobes bilaterally. Skin ulcers were noted on the shin of her lower extremity. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed large bilateral pleural effusions, severe bronchiectasis bilaterally with septal thickening, dilated medium-sized airways with eccentric pulmonary arteries, and thin walled cysts . The results of pleural fluid analysis were consistent with an exudate and were negative for signs of malignancy or infection. A pleural biopsy was also negative for malignant cells and the results were consistent with benign mesothelial cells and histiocytes. Echocardiography showed elevated right heart pressures (pulmonary arterial systolic pressure [PASP] of 39 mmHg), normal ejection fraction, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and mild diastolic dysfunction. Additional laboratory test results showed pancytopenia: hemoglobin\u2009=\u20098.9 g/dL, white count\u2009=\u20093300/mm3, and platelets\u2009=\u2009113,000/mm3.

Initial laboratory tests revealed a critically high level of serum creatine kinase (CK), measuring at 256,020 U/L. His renal profile indicated a serum creatinine level of 766.9 umol/L, a significant increase from his baseline serum creatinine level that was recorded within a normal range during an unspecified previous consultation. Arterial blood gases revealed compensated metabolic acidosis. These clinical and laboratory findings confirmed a diagnosis.\n\nDespite receiving adequate intravenous fluid hydration and close monitoring of urine output, the patient's renal function did not improve but rather continued on a deteriorating trajectory.",

Echocardiography findings were highly suggestive for precapillary pulmonary hypertension: severe right chambers dilation, D-shaped left ventricle, severe tricuspid regurgitation, high velocity of tricuspid regurgitation with pulmonary pressure estimated at 100 mmHg, dilated and not collapsing inferior vena cava, and pericardial effusion. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest excluded pulmonary embolism; high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) ruled out parenchymal diseases and mediastinal lymphadenopathy; capillaroscopy documented a scleroderma pattern; antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-centromere antibodies (ACA), and anti-mitochondrial antibodies tested positive; HIV serology tested negative; hepatic echo-Doppler ruled out portopulmonary hypertension. Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was not tested because of severe hypoxemia. Right heart catheterization (RCAT) documented a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 58 mmHg, cardiac index (CI) of 1.9 L/min/m\u00b2, right atrial pressure (RAP) of 8 mmHg, pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP) of 8 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 16 Woods units (WU). Laboratory tests showed a monoclonal spike of IgG-\u03bb. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (34 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (34 U/L) and bilirubin levels (1 mg/dL) tested within normal ranges. N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) tested positive for possible heart failure (4534 ng/L). Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was ruled out as a cause of PAH by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Continuous intravenous treatment with epoprostenol was proposed but refused by the patient, who was therefore treated with a high dose of furosemide before starting a specific oral therapy for PAH. At first, suspecting PVOD, sildenafil 20 mg BID was prescribed and titrated to 20 mg TID over 1 month, without reported adverse effects. After this, macitentan was prescribed at 10 mg OD. After 1 month, a significant increase in AST (485 U/L) and ALT (451 U/L) levels was found on routine analyses. Macitentan therapy was therefore suspended, with a gradual decrease in levels of transaminases. Liver ultrasound and complete viral serology showed no signs of specific diseases. After suspending macitentan administration, the patient\u2019s clinical condition worsened and sildenafil was replaced with tadalafil 20 mg OD, which was then titrated to 40 mg OD. In February 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases, selexipag therapy was introduced with slow titration. After 2 months, at the dose of 800 mcg BID with selexipag, AST and ALT levels were increased (201 and 232 U/L). Selexipag therapy was suspended, and RCAT was performed, resulting in the following: mean PAP of 62 mmHg, CI of 2.6 L/min/m\u00b2, RAP of 6 mmHg, and PVR of 12.7 WU. The implant of a subcutaneous pump for treprostinil infusion was proposed but refused by the patient. In May 2021, with normalization of levels of transaminases and after a pharmacogenetics consultation, ambrisentan was prescribed (5 mg/die) in association with tadalafil (40 mg/die). After the last RCAT (PAP 42 mmHg, CI 3.5 l/min/m\u00b2, RAP 6 mmHg, PVR 7.7 UW), the patient started triple therapy, adding inhaled iloprost.

Initially, the patient showed a good response to prokinetic drugs and changes in the diet, but gradually her condition deteriorated. She recorded a 20 kg weight loss. On arrival at our department, the patient was hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, she appeared cachectic and had a burn injury scar on her face. Her abdominal examination and cardiovascular examination were normal. On neurological examination, she was well oriented in time, place, person, and perception. She had decreased tone in bilateral lower limbs with a power of 2/5. She had absent reflexes with downgoing plantars in bilateral lower limbs. Her sensory examination of lower limbs revealed diminished vibratory and proprioception sensations; however, pain, temperature, and touch sensations were intact.

She was the fourth child in the family and was born as a result of a full-term, well-controlled pregnancy. No history of drug use or exposure to radiation during pregnancy was reported. Delivery was completed at the Gynecological center at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo, with a birth weight (BW) of 3600 g. Cholecalciferol (D3) for prevention of vitamin D deficiency was administered regularly. She was vaccinated regularly as per national vaccination calendar. She was breastfed for 1 year and a half, and supplementary food was introduced at 6 months of life. Her growth and development were normal. No relevant family history was reported. She was diagnosed with epilepsy 4 years ago. She initially presented with generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, and antiepileptic therapy, valproic acid, was initiated by pediatric neurologist. Despite treatment and compliance with therapy, seizures continued; therefore, a second antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, was introduced, and she continued to be on both antiepileptic drugs and comply with therapy. However, recently, she started to manifest hallucinations, emotional disturbances, and irritability, and the psychiatrist put her on fluoxetine. Later, she experienced cognitive decline, behavioral change, dysarthria, and difficulty walking. At admission, she weighed 40 kg and was disoriented, irritable, and unable to communicate. Physical examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed no erythema or swelling, but difficulty walking independently. Other system examination revealed no pathologic findings. Overall, the results of routine blood tests showed normal values; hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count was 156,000/mm3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein was negative. Furthermore, liver enzymes, urea, and creatinine, as well as acid\u2013base status of the blood, were within normal values. Other investigations, including urinalysis, were negative, too. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses excluded infectious and immune-mediated etiology. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed, and the psychiatrist was consulted. Owing to progressive neurological status deterioration and lack of response to therapy, it was decided to send the child to a more advanced center abroad for genetic testing because of the inability to perform genetic testing in the country. At the same time, axillary skin biopsy was performed and inclusion bodies were detected. The results of genetic testing also confirmed the diagnosis by detecting a mutation on the NHLRC1 gene. Therefore, parental testing to confirm their carrier status was recommended, as well as genetic counseling. By the time the diagnosis was confirmed, the child had almost lost the ability to walk and speak. She could walk with great difficulty with the help of both parents on each side (the rest of the time via wheelchair) and could articulate a few sentences with difficulty. She still remains in this condition (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).",

The result was as follows: The patient is alert and oriented with normal speech. Sensory or motor deficit is absent. Muscle strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are brisk, 2+, and symmetric in limbs. Babinski reflex is negative, and examination cranial nerves reveals them to be intact. Cerebellar tests such as finger to nose and heel to shin is smooth without dysmetria. Coordination is intact measured by walk toe\u2013heel. Gait is steady with normal base. According to the possible chances of associated neurological deficits, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered and came back as unremarkable.\n\nExtensive systemic workup was also undertaken to search for an underlying etiology.

He denied any allergies, history of sexually transmitted infections, smoking, and drinking, and had had no surgeries in the past. He had been administered broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone 2 g) intravenously following the suture, with no improvement. Untreated, such symptoms rapidly destroy the gliding mechanism, causing adhesion formation and giving rise to necrosis. Afterward, the patient began to experience pain and swelling at the injured finger, later over his entire hand and wrist area.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed shift of the descending and sigmoid colon toward the right side with dilation , but there were no significant findings suggestive of the reason for acute abdominal pain. The patient revisited hospital the next day with continuous lower abdominal pain and bloody stool. Vital signs were oxygen saturation 97% under room air, respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute, pulse 106 beats/minute, blood pressure 173/97 mmHg, and body temperature 37.6 \u00b0C. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension and tenderness. Blood examination showed white blood cell (WBC) 11320/\u03bcL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 3.81 mg/dL, and hemoglobin (Hb) 8.7 g/dL. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.467, pO2 94.2 mmHg, pCO2 34.9 mmHg, HCO3 24.6 mmol/L, base excess (BE) 1.1 mmol/L, and lactate (Lac) 0.7 mmol/L (). Secondary abdominal CT showed strangulation and dilation of the sigmoid colon in the pelvic space, although there was no perceptible free air or ascites . The descending colon was running more to the medial side, similar to in the first CT image . The patient underwent endoscopic reduction with PDM . Endoscopic reduction failed to release the volvulus, however, and emergency surgery was performed.\n\nFig. 1 First abdominal CT shows dilated sigmoid colon on the right side (arrows) and shifted descending colon towards the medial side (arrowheads) (a). Second abdominal CT shows strangulation (arrows) and the oral dilated sigmoid colon (arrowheads) (b).

The patient presented with PDM (d) Full size image  preoperative blood examination and blood gas analysis Full size table\n\nOperative findings The procedure was performed laparoscopically. Dilated sigmoid colon with partial poorly colored region was seen within the pelvic cavity . Strangulation of the sigmoid colon was detected (Fig. 2a, b) and released as soon as possible . The descending colon was running more to the medial side with adherence to small intestinal mesentery , suggesting PDM. The sigmoid colon had shortened mesentery . Detachment of the adhesion between the descending colon and small intestinal mesentery, dissection of the sigmoid colonic mesentery toward the root of inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), and identification of the root of the IMA, were by medial approach. There was no Toldt\u2019s fusion fascia at the descending colon, so the abdominal cavity at the lateral side of the descending colon was reached directly . PDM was therefore diagnosed due to abnormality of fixation of the descending colon. Detaching the partial adhesion between the colon and the abdominal wall, we dissected the sigmoid colon while preserving the superior rectal artery (SRA). Elongating the wound site and pulling out the sigmoid colon, we resected the sigmoid colon including the poorly colored segment. The left colonic artery (LCA) was not dissected because there was a possibility of colonic ischemia due to shortened sigmoid mesentery. Colon\u2013colon anastomosis was made by circular stapler. Inserting the drain into the pelvic bottom and washing the abdominal cavity, we finished the operation. The operation time was 182 minutes and the amount of blood loss was 108 mL.\n\nFig. 2 Operative findings revealed dilated sigmoid colon (arrows) and strangulation of the sigmoid colon (arrowheads) (a).

Consequently, emergency surgery was deemed necessary. Laparoscopic surgery revealed a dilated sigmoid colon with a partially discolored region within the pelvic cavity, further raising suspicions of a laceration. The sigmoid colon was found to have shortened mesentery, and adhesion between the descending colon and small intestinal mesentery suggested PDM. The operation involved detaching the adhesion between the colon and the abdominal wall, resecting the suspected lacerated sigmoid colon while preserving the superior rectal artery (SRA), and performing a colon-colon anastomosis using a circular stapler.

    "original_case": "A 41-year-old Iranian woman, without any history of known immunodeficiency conditions presented with slowly growing crusted, painful, and ulcerative lesions on her lips since 10 months ago. The patient had no history of smoking, alcohol, and opium use. She had a history of anxiety symptoms with no specific diagnosis. There was no travel history or unusual behavior. The patient had no classical risk factors for the development of opportunistic infection, prominent history of trauma, cosmetic lip tattoo, or burning in her lips. She had taken corticosteroid nasal spray for bronchitis. The clinical examination revealed an ill-demarcated, kissing ulcer associated thick, crusted area with a size of 3\u2009\u00d7\u20091 cm on her lower lip. The ulcer was tender and discharged when pressed . There were no symptoms of interdigital intertrigo involvement nor signs of onychomycosis. The patient was not febrile, and there was no regional lymphadenopathy. The oral mucosa and tongue tissues were normal. Systemic general examinations were not noticeable. The results of screening for human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab), hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ab, and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) were negative. At the onset of symptoms, she complained of dysphagia; however, she had typical results for endoscopic evaluation. Despite the local wound care and topical antifungal and antimicrobial therapy, immunosuppressive treatment with suspicion of immunobullous disorders and long-term antibiotic therapy worsened the wound. The clinical differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, other malignant lesions, ulcerative leishmaniasis, ulcerative mycobacterial infection, erosive lichen planus, immunobullous disorders, and opportunistic fungal infection was considered. Following these clinical manifestations, incisional skin biopsy samples were collected from the lower lip twice. Histopathological examination with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, severe acanthosis, spongiosis, and exocytosis of inflammatory cells in the epidermis accompanied by edema in papillary dermis with several inflammatory cells around blood vessels which were nonspecific . Direct immunofluorescence evaluation was negative for immunobullous diseases. The direct smear for leishmaniasis was negative. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test was negative. On direct microscopic examination (DME) with potassium hydroxide (KOH 10%), hyaline septate hyphae were seen . After 6 days, pink cottony growth with an irregular margin was grown on sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Merck) with chloramphenicol , and fusiform microconidia and monophialides were seen in the microscopic scene . Antifungal susceptibility testing was considered using broth microdilution according to the clinical and laboratory standard institute methods. The MIC values were as follows: amphotericin B (1 mg/mL), voriconazole (4 mg/mL), itraconazole (0.032 mg/mL), and posaconazole (8 mg/mL). For molecular identification, the ITS1\u20115.8SrDNA\u2011ITS2 region was amplified using ITS1 (5\u2032-TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG G-3\u2032) and ITS4 (5\u2032-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3\u2032) primers. The PCR products were sent to sequence analysis in a forward direction (Bioneer, South Korea). The results were analyzed with Chromas 2.4 software (Nucleics Pty Ltd, Sydney) and the NCBI BLAST online tool targeting fungal sequences in DNA databases (Nucleotide Blast online tool).",

    "original_case": "A 15-year-old African American female with a past medical history of allergic rhinitis and obesity presented with lower extremity and periorbital edema, and was found to have nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and renal insufficiency (). Her father had a history of ESRD of unknown etiology and died from a myocardial infarction in his forties. She worked at T Mobile as a salesperson. She had not traveled outside of Illinois, which is where she was born and had lived her whole life. She denied alcohol or tobacco use and her only medication was loratadine as needed for allergic rhinitis. She underwent a renal biopsy and nine out of the twenty sampled glomeruli featured segmental or global scarring. In the non-globally sclerotic glomeruli, the glomerular tufts showed marked visceral epithelial cell proliferation and the glomerulus showed global collapse. Diffuse foot process effacement was present on electron micrography . Work-up for secondary causes was negative. She received oral prednisone and cyclosporine for about 2 years (dose unknown), achieved partial remission (defined as a reduction in proteinuria by 50% or more and stable renal function), and was maintained on oral losartan 100 mg daily.\n\n Patient characteristics at various timepoints of disease course\nFull size table\nFig. 1 a A silver stain showing parietal epithelial cell proliferation and collapse of the glomerular tuft. b An electron micrograph showing diffuse foot process effacement Full size image\n\nAt the age of 27, she presented to the hospital with several weeks of fever, sore throat, chest pain, and body aches. Outpatient testing for influenza, streptococcus, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus was negative. On admission, her temperature was 104.4 F, blood pressure 117/76 mmHg, and heart rate 114 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed a cooperative female in no acute distress, normal conjunctiva, unremarkable oropharynx without pharyngeal erythema, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, sinus tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs, clear lung fields, benign abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, diffuse joint tenderness but no joint swelling, no rash, normal gait, and intact cranial nerves, motor strength, sensation, and reflexes. Laboratory examination was significant for leukocytosis, acute on chronic kidney disease, nephrotic range proteinuria, and mild transaminitis. Serologies showed antinuclear antibodies (ANA) of 1:80, negative dsDNA, normal complement levels, rheumatoid factor (RF) of 60 IU/mL, negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type A (SSA) > 8, and negative anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type B (SSB). Ferritin was > 40,000 ng/mL (). Electrocardiogram (EKG) was noted to have diffuse ST segment elevations , troponin was 2 ng/mL, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild pericardial effusion ; this constellation was consistent with pericarditis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, pelvis (CAP) showed a small left sided pleural effusion . CT of the neck showed enlarged bilateral lymph nodes without evidence of abscess.\n\nFig. 2 Electrocardiogram with diffuse PR segment depression and ST segment elevation consistent with pericarditis Full size image\nFig.3 Transthoracic echocardiogram with mild pericardial effusion Full size image\nFig. 4 Computed tomography chest, abdomen, pelvis with small pleural effusion and atelectasis at left lung base Full size image\n\nAfter no underlying infectious or malignancy causes were identified, a primary rheumatological process was considered. She was given a trial of oral prednisone (60 mg daily), with resolution of fever and leukocytosis and symptomatic improvement. Oral colchicine (0.6 mg daily for 1 month) was added to treat the pericarditis. Repeat renal biopsy re-demonstrated the previous findings and, specifically, absence of SLE features. Her rheumatological presentation was felt to be most consistent with AoSD, given the fevers, arthralgias, leukocytosis, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, elevations in aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT), and the markedly elevated ferritin. Although she had a positive RF, her clinical presentation was not compatible with rheumatoid arthritis. Given her low titer ANA and positive SSA, the possibility of SLE was considered. She was maintained on oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily) and monitored closely in the rheumatology clinic, but over years of follow-up her presentation remained more consistent with AoSD rather than SLE. Additionally, she lacked signs or symptoms to suggest a diagnosis of Sjogren\u2019s disease.\n\nDuring follow-up in the rheumatology clinic, attempts to wean oral prednisone below 10 mg daily were unsuccessful, resulting in flares characterized by fevers, sore throat, facial swelling, arthralgias, myalgias, urticarial rash, flank pain, chest pain, and associated elevated inflammatory markers. Oral methotrexate (15 mg weekly) was added in August 2018 as a steroid sparing agent, with initial improvement. Due to a recurrence of pericardial effusion and inability to increase her methotrexate dose due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 4 weeks) was added in December 2018. Given continued disease activity, the patient was switched to subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg daily) in January 2020 and methotrexate and tocilizumab were discontinued. During this time, her condition remained stable on oral losartan (100 mg daily).\n\nHer rheumatologic disease was quiescent for several months on anakinra, but then the patient developed fever and dry cough requiring admission in March 2020. Infectious work up was negative. Laboratory work-up was concerning for flare of her AoSD although she lacked her usual symptoms of joint pain, sore throat, chest pain, and rashes (). She improved with an increased dose of oral prednisone to 30 mg daily. Shortly after that admission, she developed acute on chronic kidney injury with nephrotic range proteinuria and progression to ESRD. Her anakinra dose was reduced to every other day dosing to account for her ESRD.\n\nShe was admitted to the hospital in September 2020 for fever, malaise, headache, dyspnea, cough, and diarrhea. On presentation, her temperature was 101.4 F, blood pressure 97/55 mmHg, and heart rate 119 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing female, normal conjunctiva, unremarkable oropharynx without pharyngeal erythema, sinus tachycardia with no additional heart sounds or murmurs, clear lung fields, benign abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly, unremarkable joint examination without evidence of synovitis, malar rash, chest hyperpigmentation, intact cranial nerves, left arm weakness, intact sensation, and intact reflexes. Anakinra was held due to her fevers and ongoing infectious work-up. Laboratory work-up was significant for leukocytosis, worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, and CK 4000 U/L (). CT CAP showed new splenomegaly as well as lymphadenopathy. The patient rapidly deteriorated, resulting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and death within a few days of admission. There was concern that she may have progressed to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (new cytopenia, splenomegaly, high-grade fevers, profoundly elevated ferritin) but additional supportive laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy were not obtained. Autopsy revealed bilateral lung consolidation with red hepatization of all five lobes, green\u2013black mucosal discoloration around the gastric fundus, and hepatosplenomegaly with liver weight of 211 g (expected 1500\u20131800 g) and spleen weight of 414 g (expected 125\u2013195 g). It was concluded that the cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.",

His oncological history included immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as a paraneoplastic syndrome with 7000 platelets/mcL, associated with a 4.6-cm lung carcinoma as an incidental diagnosis. Diagnostic testing was performed, ruling out syphilis, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, without gamma alteration in serum protein electrophoresis or any blood smear findings. No further autoantibody tests were performed. Corticosteroids were administered during 1 week at 1 mg/kg of methylprednisolone doses together with intravenous immunoglobulins during 5 days, with complete resolution of ITP.\n\nAfter surgery, stage IIB (pT2aN1), moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed. Surgical margins were affected, thus treatment was completed with concurrent weekly docetaxel with radiotherapy with good tolerance. Six months after initial presentation, early progression was evidenced with pleural thickening and pleural effusion. The pathological study was completed with no targeted mutations found and with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) <1% in tumor cells and 25% in stroma cells by 22C3 immunohistochemistry assay. First-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel was started, with partial response after receiving six cycles. Eighteen months after finishing first-line chemotherapy, with maintained response, new pleural progression was evidenced, as confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan. It was thus decided to start a second line with atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody).\n\nTwo weeks after receiving immunotherapy, he presented to the emergency room with severe dyspnea accompanied by intense asthenia, myalgia, and fever of 39 \u00b0C. He denied contact with people suffering coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) infection. Upon presentation, he was conscious and alert with all neurological functions preserved, hemodynamically stable, tachypneic, with 93% oxygen saturation in room air. He looked pale and had bruises on both arms on physical examination. Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly stood out, and auscultation revealed an abolition of left lung sounds. A blood test confirmed moderate pancytopenia, glomerular filtration rate of 50 ml/minute (previously normal), an increase in acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein and ferritin), and elevated levels of D-dimer >20 times normal value (). A computerized angiotomography was performed with no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism, neither lung infiltrates nor pleural effusion.\n\nDuring the next 24 hours, he started vomiting with an altered level of consciousness with drowsiness. He had miotic pupils, without other signs of neurological dysfunction. On examination, he had developed progressive jaundice with abdominal pain in the right flank. A few hours later, he suffered a tonic\u2013clonic seizure. Initially, COVID-19 was rejected, and blood tests were repeated at 24 hours, revealing pancytopenia, hyperbilirrubinemia, and hypertransaminitis. Head computed tomography (CT) was performed with no alterations, and a blood smear showed anisocytosis with some elliptocytes. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated due to neurological deterioration with a score of 8 on the Glasgow scale. After assessing the risks and benefits, no lumbar puncture was done. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was started, but the possibility that it was a hemophagocytic syndrome was raised and a differential diagnosis was started. Serologies were negative for HSV1-2, CMV, EBV, HIV, HBV, HCV, and HLTV-1 viruses. Elevated IL-6 (19.4 pg/mL) and CD25 (6516 U/m) were found with normal angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. He had 110 CD4 and 620 CD8 lymphocytes with very low CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.18. H-score for hemophagocytic syndrome was 256 points (> 99% probability). Given the high suspicion, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was initiated using 20 mg dexamethasone bolus as 1 mg/kg equivalent of methylprednisolone since day 1. Finally, bone marrow biopsy was performed, showing reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis, and dysplastic signs in megakaryocytic and erythroid reactive lines.\n\nFig. 1 A Bone marrow biopsy with reactive hypercellularity, hemophagocytosis (red arrow), and dysplastic signs in megakaryocytic and erythroid reactive lines.

Treatment with mycophenolate mofetil was added on day 3 for the next two days and finally, 5 days after admission, etoposide 100 mg/m2. Without any clinical improvement, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, showing extensive white matter damage . To study the degree of brain involvement, an electroencephalogram was done and revealed symmetrical background activity consisting of a 2\u20134 Hz, bilateral, irregular, low-voltage rhythm with no reactivity to eyelid closure\u2013opening, corresponding to diffuse and severe degree brain involvement. Hence, it was decided to limit the therapeutic effort.\n\nFig. 2 MRI T1 and T2 sequences with extensive involvement of supra- and infratentorial white matter, with bilateral and asymmetric damage, deep and superficial, of corpus callosum and internal capsules.

The pain was sharp, radiating to the back and was worse on lying supine. Pain was associated with fever, nausea, and vomiting for the same duration. The patient denied any history of recent infection, or of consuming any new medication or herbal drugs. The patient was only on iron and folic acid supplements during the course of her pregnancy. The patient was a nonsmoker and had never consumed alcohol. Her past medical, surgical, and family history were not significant. The patient was a housewife and comes from a middle-class family. Her obstetric follow-up was uneventful so far. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine 1 week prior to the onset of symptoms. On general examination, the patient was conscious, oriented, and alert. Heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, body temperature of 101\u00b0F, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% in room air were recorded. On abdominal examination, no obvious skin rashes were visualized in the abdomen. There was abdominal distension with gravid uterus and severe epigastric tenderness. The cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. The initial blood investigations revealed a total leukocyte count of 17 \u00d7 10^9/L, serum lipase of 4376 U/L, and serum amylase of 83 U/L. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed features of pancreatitis. Her gall bladder was normal and no gallstones were seen. A real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 screening was done prior to admission and was negative. On the second day of admission, the patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery and the baby was shifted to the neonatal ICU in a stable condition. In view of ongoing upper abdomen pain, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed, which revealed bulky pancreas with mild enhancement and marked peripancreatic fat stranding with inflammation, suggestive of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis . Over the next 48 hours, her pain settled and slowly oral intake was encouraged. Blood cultures taken at admission were sterile. The pancreatic enzymes on day 4 of admission were in the normal range. Her diet was changed to regular after the improvement of symptoms, and the patient was discharged in a stable condition on day 7. She was reviewed at 1 month and again after 6 months in the clinic and has remained stable since then.

    "rewritten_case": "A primigravida South-Asian female, aged 24 years, reported to the hospital with complaints of sharp, back-radiating epigastric pain, which she found to intensify while lying supine. Along with this, she was also experiencing fever, nausea, and vomiting, with no indication of when these symptoms began. The patient had no recent history of infection and had not been using any new medications or herbal drugs. She was taking iron and folic acid supplements throughout her pregnancy. The patient was a nonsmoker and did not consume alcohol. Her background medical, surgical, and family history were unremarkable. She was a housewife from a middle-class background, and her obstetric follow-up had been uneventful. She had received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, but the timing relative to the onset of symptoms was unclear. \n\nOn general examination, the patient was conscious, oriented, and alert. Her heart rate was 106 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, her body temperature was 101\u00b0F, her respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Her abdominal examination did not reveal any obvious skin rashes, but there was distension due to the gravid uterus and severe epigastric tenderness. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.\n\nBlood tests revealed a total leukocyte count of 17 \u00d7 10^9/L, serum lipase of 4376 U/L, and serum amylase of 83 U/L. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed signs of pancreatitis, but the gall bladder appeared normal with no gallstones present. The patient had previously tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) screening. During her hospital stay, she had a spontaneous vaginal delivery and the baby was moved to the neonatal ICU in a stable condition. \n\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed due to ongoing upper abdominal pain. It revealed a bulky pancreas with mild enhancement and marked peripancreatic fat stranding with inflammation, suggesting acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis. Eventually, her pain subsided and she was encouraged to begin oral intake. The blood cultures taken were sterile and the pancreatic enzymes returned to the normal range within an unspecified number of days. Once her symptoms improved, her diet was changed to regular and she was discharged in a stable condition. She has since remained stable, as confirmed in her follow-up clinic visits. \n\nDetailed evaluations for all possible etiologies of pancreatitis failed to reveal any specific cause. Her liver function tests, calcium, and triglycerides have been normal. Her antinuclear antibody(ANA) was negative. An ultrasound performed during her hospital stay, and a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) performed at some point post-discharge revealed no gallstones, a normal pancreatic duct, and no abnormal pancreaticobiliary union.",

    "original_case": "A 28-year-old Caucasian man with history of testicular cancer in remission presented with altered mental status, syncope, vertical gaze palsy, ataxia, and tremor. He was in his usual state of health until 2 years ago, when he noticed a large right testicular mass. Work-up revealed marginally enlarged intraabdominal lymph nodes without evidence of metastases. One and a half years ago, he underwent radical unilateral orchiectomy. Pathology revealed malignant mixed germ cell tumor with abundant necrosis, comprising 50% teratoma, 45% embryonal carcinoma, and 5% yolk sac tumor. The mixed germ cell tumor was limited to the testicle without evidence of invasion. Lymph nodes were not examined pathologically. Alpha fetal protein (AFP) was mildly elevated at 9 ng/mL (reference range: 0\u20136.7 ng/mL) and normalized postoperatively. The patient opted for surveillance instead of chemotherapy after consultation with an oncologist. Three months prior to admission, the patient started experiencing fatigue and weight gain of 18 kg over 2 months. He was diagnosed with hypogonadism based on a low testosterone level of 127 ng/dL and started testosterone supplementation. Three weeks prior to admission, he began experiencing difficulty with upward and downward gaze. His fatigue continued to worsen, and he stopped working. One week prior to admission, he developed confusion, which manifested in difficulty remembering his dogs\u2019 names and asking questions in strangely worded ways. He also developed bilateral tremor and ataxia, causing him to fall on a daily basis. The worsening of these neurological symptoms led him to present to the emergency department. While hospitalized, he had an episode of syncope. As this was being evaluated, he was noted to have hypovolemia due to polyuria, which was concerning for diabetes insipidus and, consequently, hypothalamic involvement of his underlying disease. Ultimately, the patient did not meet criteria for diabetes insipidus but did have elevated prolactin of 52.0 ng/mL, concerning for some hypothalamic injury. Due to suspicion that his condition could extend to the pituitary, the patient underwent testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The decreased levels of the above hormones revealed probable panhypopituitarism, with TSH of 0.11 mcIU/mL, free T4 of 1.0 ng/dL, ACTH of <2 pg/mL, LH of 0.5 pg/mL, and FSH of 1.3 mIU/mL. Of note, he was placed on high-dose steroids immediately and has consistently been on these higher-dose steroids, so he has been unable to undergo a cosyntropin test to confirm central adrenal insufficiency. He also underwent a neurologic work-up, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI imaging of the pituitary, which showed T2 prolongation involving the bilateral mesial temporal lobes, hippocampi/fornices, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies and mammillothalamic tracts, and midbrain including periaqueductal gray with normal pituitary (Figs. 1 and 2). His presentation was concerning for encephalitis involving subcortical white matter, deep brain structures, and dorsal midbrain. A lumbar puncture showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and was positive for oligoclonal bands. A broad infectious work-up was otherwise negative. He received high-dose steroids, five sessions of plasmapheresis, and 5 days of intravenous immunoglobulin, without significant improvement in his physical examination or mental status. Repeat ultrasound of the testes, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans, and AFP levels were all normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer. He was discharged with close follow-up.

Unfortunately, the patient did not make significant improvement after his hospitalization, losing the ability to walk and to clear his nasopharyngeal secretions. A few months later, the patient was readmitted to the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) for progression of his condition, which was complicated by thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, sepsis, and worsening neurological status. During this hospitalization, the patient underwent tracheostomy and placement of a gastric tube. Repeat brain MRI showed similar areas of signal abnormality from prior brain MRI but with mildly decreased intensity . Repeat PET/CT scans and ultrasound of the testes were once again normal without evidence of recurrent testicular cancer or metastases. However, the patient was initiated on cyclophosphamide and lacosamide. Upon discharge, the patient continued with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, lacosamide, and levetiracetam. Now, 8 months after his initial hospitalization, the patient is closely followed by neurology and endocrinology and remains disoriented with fluctuating levels of alertness.

His initial birth weight was 2381 g (25\u201350th percentile). He failed his newborn pulse oximetry cardiac screen and was first seen by cardiology at 2 weeks of age. He was followed in the cardiology clinic again at 1 month of age. At that time, an electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a sinus tachycardia of 200 beats per minute and hypertension. An echocardiogram was significant for left ventricular hypertrophy with septal wall thickness in diastole of 7 mm and a posterior wall measurement of 5 mm consistent with left ventricular noncompaction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype. He was also noted to have different skin tones and pigmentation from trunk to lower extremities. He was started on a beta-blocker with plans to follow up in clinic in 2 months and was referred to dermatology for evaluation of the skin lesions.  \nAt 6 weeks of age, he presented to the cardiomyopathy clinic owing to left ventricular hypertrophy and was also having difficulty feeding. He was then admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive. At admission, his weight was 3100 g (<\u20092nd percentile), length was 48 cm (3rd\u201310th percentile), and head circumference was 34 cm (<\u20092nd percentile). His physical examination findings were significant for hypertension (101/68 mmHg), tachycardia, facial fullness, hyperpigmented lesions on his skin, marked hypotonia, and hepatomegaly. He had irregular hyperpigmentation characterized as a swirling pattern over the back measuring approximately 5\u2009\u00d7\u20092 cm in area under the right axilla and extending to the right portion of the anterior trunk, stopping at the midline.  \nLaboratory findings demonstrated transaminitis: aspartate transaminase (AST) 99 U/L (normal 22\u201363 U/L); alanine transaminase (ALT) 250 U/L (normal 13\u201339 U/L); total bilirubin 2.3 mg/dL (normal 0.2\u20131.0 mg/dL).  \nA chest radiograph raised concern for cardiomegaly, and an osseous x-ray showed multiple lesions of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia . Genetics was consulted during the hospital admission. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the findings of adrenal fullness on a renal ultrasound in conjunction with the hyperpigmented lesion, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cardiomyopathy, and elevated liver function tests (LFT). Repeat echocardiograms showed persistent concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, with initial thickness of the left ventricular wall of 4.7 mm (Z-score 2.6) reaching a maximum of 7.1 mm (Z-score 1.7) (). Systemic hypertension was confirmed with systolic pressures up to 130 mmHg and diastolic pressures up to 77 mmHg.  \nFig. 1  \nSkeletal survey demonstrating polyostotic fibrous dysplasia; top left, right upper extremity; top right, left upper extremity; bottom left, left femur  \nFull size image  \n Measurement of left posterior wall thickness (LV PW) on each echocardiogram  \nFull size table  \nA renal ultrasound was negative for renal vein anomalies, and metanephrines were also found to be normal. A random cortisol done via immunoassay was found to be 36.4 \u03bcg/dL (1.7\u201314.0 \u03bcg/dL, Vitros 5600). Total protein, albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine kinase were normal. An abdominal ultrasound showed increased liver echogenicity, bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands, and bilateral nephrocalcinosis.  \nGiven the likelihood of the condition, evaluation was performed. Biochemical evaluation showed elevated serum cortisol without diurnal variation (8 a.m. cortisol at 38.2 \u03bcg/dL and 7 p.m. cortisol at 36.4 \u03bcg/dL; normal 2.8\u201323.0 \u03bcg/dL). Urinary free cortisol was elevated to 35 \u03bcg/dL/24 hours (reference range 3\u20139 \u03bcg/dL/24 hours) (Esoterix; Calabasas, CA). A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test revealed a cortisol of 38.2 \u03bcg/dL and an ACTH level of <\u20095 pg/mL; this was followed by a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test that showed a serum cortisol of 60.1 \u03bcg/dL. These results showed that failure to suppress cortisol was consistent with ACTH-independent condition.  \nA skin biopsy of a caf\u00e9-au-lait lesion on his back was obtained for gene analysis at All Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida and was negative.

She had experienced nausea and vomiting during the night prior to her presentation at the hospital coupled with inability to tolerate oral intake. Her presentation at the hospital was driven by worsening of these symptoms. She had history of intermittent burning type of epigastric pain prior to pregnancy. She also had contraction and leakage of liquor of 2 hours duration which started while on the way to our hospital. There was no history of vaginal bleeding. Upon arrival, the patient was in acute distress, with the following vital signs: blood pressure, 95/60 mmHg; pulse rate, 132 beats per minute (bpm); respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 35.9 \u00b0C. Abdominal examination showed a grossly distended, rigid, and diffusely tender abdomen, which showed limited movement with respiration. Uterine fundal height was consistent with the gestational age. There were three uterine contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting for 35\u201340 seconds. The fetal heart beat (FHB) ranged from 120 to 158 bpm. Digital vaginal examination revealed a cervix of 3-cm dilation, a ruptured membrane, clear liquor, and high station. An upright abdominal X-ray demonstrated air under the diaphragm . A bedside ultrasound showed a single intrauterine pregnancy, positive FHB, fundal anterior placenta with a central thickness of 35 mm, gestational age of 36 weeks, an estimated fetal weight of 3000 g, no gross anomaly, and massive amount of intraperitoneal fluid. Fig. 1 Upper abdominal X-ray taken before laparotomy showed air under the diaphragm (arrow) Full size image With the diagnosis of latent first stage of labor plus acute abdomen, a general surgeon was consulted, and it was decided to perform laparotomy after delivery. She was resuscitated with crystalloids and put on intranasal oxygen, a nasogastric tube was inserted, and she was catheterized. She was started on intravenous ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and omeprazole. At 4 hours after admission, the labor was augmented with oxytocin, and an alive male neonate weighing 2900 g with an Apgar score of 5 and 8 in the first and fifth minutes respectively, was delivered vaginally. At 2 hours after delivery, a general surgeon performed a laparotomy via midline abdominal incision.

    "rewritten_case": "A 35-year-old Ethiopian woman, Gravida 7 and Para 6, with no significant past medical history arrived at Dilchora Referral Hospital. She was at a gestational age of 36 weeks. The patient reported experiencing intermittent burning type of epigastric pain prior to pregnancy. Recently, she had been experiencing right upper quadrant pain that radiated to her back, coupled with nausea, vomiting, and inability to tolerate oral intake. She also noticed contraction and leakage of liquor, which started while she was on her way to the hospital. However, there was no history of vaginal bleeding. \n\nUpon arrival, the patient was in acute distress. Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 95/60 mmHg; pulse rate, 132 beats per minute (bpm); respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; and body temperature, 35.9 \u00b0C. Abdominal examination showed a grossly distended, rigid, and diffusely tender abdomen, which showed limited movement with respiration. Uterine fundal height was consistent with the gestational age. \n\nThe patient experienced several uterine contractions, each lasting for roughly half a minute. Fetal heart beat (FHB) ranged from 120 to 158 bpm. A digital vaginal examination revealed a cervix of 3-cm dilation, a ruptured membrane, clear liquor, and high station. An upright abdominal X-ray demonstrated air under the diaphragm. A bedside ultrasound showed a single intrauterine pregnancy, positive FHB, fundal anterior placenta with a central thickness of 35 mm, gestational age of 36 weeks, an estimated fetal weight of 3000 g, no gross anomaly, and massive amount of intraperitoneal fluid.\n\nThe diagnosis of latent first stage of labor plus acute abdomen led to consultation with a general surgeon. It was decided to perform laparotomy after delivery. She was resuscitated with crystalloids and put on intranasal oxygen, a nasogastric tube was inserted, and she was catheterized. She was started on intravenous ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and omeprazole. \n\nLabor was augmented with oxytocin, leading to the vaginal delivery of a live male neonate weighing 2900 g. His Apgar score was 5 and 8 in the first and fifth minutes respectively. A general surgeon performed a laparotomy via midline abdominal incision after delivery. This revealed a copious amount of thin pus in the abdominal cavity and a 0.5 \u00d7 0.5-cm anterior perforation of the first part of the duodenum. The perforation was repaired, and an omental patch (Graham\u2019s patch) repair was performed. \n\nThe patient was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) after the procedure.

    "original_case": "We present a rare and interesting case of a 68-year-old White male. His past medical history included hypertension, prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy, and a benign parotid tumor status post-parotidectomy 20 years prior. He was retired from working in corporate management, and family history was significant for lung cancer in his father and breast cancer in a sister. Comorbid illnesses included gastrointestinal reflux disease, for which he took ranitidine 150 mg daily and omeprazole 20 mg daily; hypertension, for which he took lisinopril 12.5 mg daily; hyperlipidemia, for which he took atorvastatin 20 mg daily; and seasonal allergies and asthma, for which he took montelukast 150 mg daily and loratadine 10 mg daily. He was also using naproxen and cannabis for cancer-related pain at time of presentation. He was a lifelong non-smoker and did not drink alcohol to excess. He first noticed his right neck mass while shaving 3 months prior to presentation. He reported some mild pain with swallowing, weight loss of unknown amount, right neck sensitivity to light touch, increased hoarseness, and a raspy voice. He was initially diagnosed by his primary care physician as having lymphadenopathy secondary to a sinus infection and received two rounds of antibiotics. The mass failed to improve and, as a result, a fine needle aspiration of the lesion was performed. Evaluation of the biopsy material demonstrated dysmorphic cells containing cytoplasmic keratin, which stained positively for CK5/6, consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma. Monoclonal PAX-8 (Biocare Medical, BC12) staining was also focally positive . Subsequent laryngoscopy revealed no mucosal lesions, but right vocal cord paralysis was observed. A CT of the neck with contrast revealed a 4.8 cm peripherally enhancing hypodense mass with central necrosis lateral to the right hyoid bone, emanating from the thyroid gland . Multiple smaller nodular lesions within the prevertebral space, right paraesophageal region, and superior mediastinum were also identified. A staging PET scan showed a hypermetabolic right thyroid lobe with extensive conglomerate pathologic adenopathy at the right cervical lymph node chain, extending inferior to the right thoracic inlet, as well as a left retropharyngeal hypermetabolic lymph node, but no evidence of distant metastasis (Fig. 2B and C). On initial physical and neurologic examination, the oncology team noted a large, firm, fixed right medial neck mass without overlying skin changes, and a normal cranial nerve exam.\n\nFig. 1 H&E stained cell block slides (A and B, 60X) demonstrating dysmorphic cells (arrows). CK5/6 immunohistochemical stain (C, 60\u00d7) with cytoplasmic staining highlighting cells of squamous differentiation.

Full size image\n\nFig. 2 Pre-treatment diagnostic CT neck (A) and staging PET/CT (B, C) scan revealed a large right necrotic and PET-avid thyroid mass. Full size image\n\nThe patient\u2019s case was discussed at the head and neck multidisciplinary tumor board, with a consensus opinion that this squamous cell carcinoma was indeed of thyroid origin. Extensive surgical resection including a laryngectomy, thyroidectomy, and reconstruction followed by adjuvant chemoradiation as a potential curative course was recommended. However, due to the morbidity and lifestyle implications associated with surgery, the patient declined surgery and instead chose to pursue concurrent chemoradiation with weekly chemotherapy. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was used to treat the right thyroid mass to 70 Gy in 35 fractions at 200 cGy per fraction, as well as bilateral retropharyngeal nodes cervical neck nodal levels IB, II, III, IV, and V to 63 Gy in 35 fractions at 180 cGy per fraction . The patient completed radiation with weekly concurrent carboplatin-paclitaxel over 7 weeks. During treatment, he developed grade 2 fatigue, grade 2 mucositis, grade 2 dermatitis, grade 3 dysphagia, and grade 3 dry mouth with thickened secretions with excessive mucus. The skin desquamation was treated with silver sulfadiazine and mineral oil-hydrophil petrolat. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed during the first week of treatment due to nutrition and oral intake difficulties at baseline, and the patient lost less than 15 lbs throughout the treatment. Long-term toxicity was significant for chronic xerostomia and dysphagia, requiring a permanent gastrostomy tube. He also developed treatment-related hypothyroidism and was started on levothyroxine approximately 3 months after completion of treatment, when his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was found to have gone up from 1.63 (baseline, normal) to 21 mIU/mL (elevated).\n\nFig. 3 Axial view of patient\u2019s CT-based radiation treatment plan. 6 MV photon beams were utilized, and patient was prescribed to 7000 cGy in 35 fractions to the isocenter. Dose color wash is represented as a percentage relative to the prescribed 7000 cGy dose. Thyroid mass contours are delineated in red and are treated to 7000 cGy, while retropharyngeal and cervical neck nodal levels IB, II, III, and IV are delineated in yellow and treated to 6300 cGy. Full size image\n\nAfter receiving concurrent chemoradiation, the patient underwent two additional cycles of high-dose carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel every 3 weeks. Follow-up imaging after concurrent chemoradiation suggested a partial therapeutic response. PET (18-fluorodeoxyglucose/18-FDG)/CT of the neck demonstrated that the thyroid mass had decreased in size from 5.0 \u00d7 5.2 cm, with maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) of 35.3, to 3.8 \u00d7 2.1 cm, with maximum SUV of 19.4 (Fig. 4A\u2013C). This was also apparent on physical examination, where the tumor was smaller, softer, and less tender to palpation. The right and left neck lymph nodes were also notably smaller and demonstrated less PET-avidity. Imaging of the chest, however, revealed pulmonary metastases up to 9 mm in size, as well as multiple bilateral hypermetabolic nodules (Fig. 4D and E).\n\nFig. 4 Post-concurrent chemoradiation PET/CT imaging with carboplatin/paclitaxel reveal a smaller thyroid tumor size (A) and decreased PET-avidity (B, C), but show new bilateral pulmonary metastases (D, E). Full size image\n\nIn light of the new pulmonary metastatic disease, additional systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin\u2013paclitaxel was recommended to the patient. However, he opted for immunotherapy instead due to previous chemotherapy side effects and subsequently completed nine cycles of pembrolizumab. Imaging studies obtained after the third cycle of pembrolizumab demonstrated an interval decrease in the size of multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally, suggesting a positive response to therapy . At the same time, however, a CT scan demonstrated an increase in the size of the thyroid mass . Additionally, new encasement of the distal common carotid artery, carotid bifurcation, and proximal internal carotid artery was present, and erosion of the thyroid cartilage was also identified. After the sixth cycle of pembrolizumab, imaging continued to demonstrate enlargement of the thyroid mass with increased extension to the tracheoesophageal groove, while the pulmonary nodules continued to get smaller (Fig. 5C and D). Following the ninth cycle of pembrolizumab, the thyroid mass had continued to enlarge, eroding the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, extending into the paraglottic space, and invading the cervical esophagus. No new or worsening pulmonary metastatic disease was identified at this time (Fig. 5E and F). The tenth cycle of pembrolizumab was halted due to leukocytosis (WBC 21.81 and ANC 19.05) and the patient\u2019s desire to pursue supportive care. Fifteen months after his initial diagnosis, the patient was transitioned to comfort care and died 3 months later. Autopsy was not performed as the patient\u2019s desire was to donate his body to science.\n\nFig. 5 Post-immunotherapy CT imaging demonstrates enlarging thyroid tumor but stable (white arrows) or decreased pulmonary metastases (dotted arrows) after three cycles (A, B), six cycles (C, D), and nine cycles (D, E) of pembrolizumab.

    "rewritten_case": "This report details an intriguing case of a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a complicated medical history. His past medical conditions included hypertension, prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy, plus a benign parotid tumor that was removed surgically 20 years ago. He was also known to have gastrointestinal reflux disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, seasonal allergies, and asthma. His medication regimen consisted of ranitidine, omeprazole, lisinopril, atorvastatin, montelukast, and loratadine. Additionally, he was using naproxen and cannabis to manage his cancer-related pain. The patient was a lifelong non-smoker and had a modest alcohol intake. Family history was notable for lung cancer in his father and breast cancer in his sister.\n\nThree months before presentation, the patient noticed a mass on his right neck while shaving. Accompanying symptoms included mild pain during swallowing, unquantified weight loss, sensitivity to light touch in the right neck region, increased hoarseness, and a raspy voice. His primary care physician initially suspected lymphadenopathy caused by a sinus infection and treated him with two rounds of antibiotics. When the mass showed no signs of improvement, a fine needle aspiration was performed. The evaluation of the biopsy material revealed dysmorphic cells containing cytoplasmic keratin, which stained positively for CK5/6, suggestive of squamous cell differentiation. However, PAX-8 monoclonal staining was also focally positive, a finding more commonly associated with thyroid neoplasms of uncertain behavior.\n\nA laryngoscopy showed no mucosal lesions but detected right vocal cord paralysis. A CT scan of the neck demonstrated a 4.8 cm peripherally enhancing hypodense mass with central necrosis in the right hyoid bone region, originating from the thyroid gland. Multiple smaller nodular lesions were identified in the prevertebral space, right paraesophageal region, and superior mediastinum. A staging PET scan revealed a hypermetabolic right thyroid lobe with extensive conglomerate pathologic adenopathy at the right cervical lymph node chain, extending inferior to the right thoracic inlet, as well as a left retropharyngeal hypermetabolic lymph node. However, there was no evidence of distant metastasis.\n\nThe multidisciplinary tumor board was convened to review the patient\u2019s case. Though the clinical findings were suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma, the focally positive PAX-8 staining raised the possibility of a neoplasm of uncertain behavior of the thyroid gland. Extensive surgical resection was recommended, but due to the patient\u2019s apprehension about the lifestyle implications, he opted for concurrent chemoradiation with weekly chemotherapy. During treatment, he experienced significant side effects and developed treatment-related hypothyroidism, necessitating levothyroxine. \n\nFollow-up imaging showed a partial therapeutic response in the thyroid mass, but new pulmonary metastases were detected, suggesting a possibility of an aggressive neoplasm of uncertain behavior, which can exhibit unpredictable growth and spread patterns. The patient elected to proceed with immunotherapy due to the side effects from chemotherapy and completed nine cycles of pembrolizumab. Imaging studies after the third cycle showed a decrease in the size of multiple pulmonary nodules, but an increase in the size of the thyroid mass. After the ninth cycle, the thyroid mass had further enlarged, eroding the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, and invading the cervical esophagus. No new or worsening pulmonary metastatic disease was identified at this time. \n\nDue to his worsening condition and patient's preference, treatment was halted after the tenth cycle, and the patient transitioned to comfort care. He passed away three months later. This case underscores the unpredictable and challenging nature of managing neoplasms of uncertain behavior of the thyroid gland.",

    "original_case": "The first case was a 49-year-old Saudi man who was found unconscious by his brother. He was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical services (EMS). On arrival, he showed decreased consciousness, hyperventilation, low-grade fever, and tachycardia. His family initially suspected that his condition was attributable to a drug overdose. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated because his Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score remained 9 despite efforts to stimulate and resuscitate him. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 136/84 mmHg; heart rate, 145 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 56 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 10 mmol/L. His physical examination was unremarkable apart from the presence of bilateral pinpoint pupils. After initial stabilization in the ED, he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of low GCS and unstable vitals. He was maintained on mechanical ventilatory support and vasopressors because of hypotension. During the second day of his stay in the ICU, he started to show signs of worsening mental status and his computed tomography (CT) scan showed evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. His stay was complicated by ongoing evidence of sepsis and end organ damage represented by acute kidney impairment, worsening coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and positive blood culture screen, with evidence of infective endocarditis on transesophageal echocardiography. This was managed by antibiotics and aggressive fluid and inotropic support. One week after admission, he showed no improvement in mental status and worsening neurological weakness. His repeated magnetic resonance imaging showed new middle cerebral artery infarction and the possibility of multiple infarcts. Attempts at weaning him from ventilatory support were unsuccessful and ended with placement of tracheostomy insertion. The patient was discharged on nasogastric and tracheostomy tubes in a stable condition but with poor functional state.\n\nOur second patient was a 24-year-old man who was brought to our institution by EMS after a road traffic accident. Upon initial assessment, he was found to be intoxicated and agitated. His GCS score was 13. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 114/61 mmHg; heart rate, 95 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% on room air; and glucose level, 5.7 mmol/L. His initial examination showed a red left eye but was otherwise unremarkable; furthermore, his extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST) examination was negative. Apart from agitation, the findings of the patient\u2019s physical examination were normal. The patient was hemodynamically stable upon assessment, with no signs of bleeding or other obvious injuries. He was acidotic with a pH of 7.25, and his HCO3 level was 10 mEq/L, as determined by analysis of the initial venous blood gas sample. Serum osmolality was 290 mOsm/kg. He received a fomepizole infusion; however, soon after sobering and admission, he discharged himself against medical advice.\n\nThe third patient was a 26-year-old man with no history of serious diseases, who presented to the ED complaining of blurry vision, vomiting, and hyperventilation that started the previous day after the consumption of an unknown amount of alcohol. He was alert and oriented to time, place, and person, with a GCS score of 15. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 141/75 mmHg; heart rate, 92 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 100% in room air; and glucose level, 5.2 mmol/L. Analysis of his venous blood sample showed a pH of 6.9, and the HCO3 level was 5.7 mEq/L. The anion gap in his serum sample was 20 mEq/L, with a measured osmolality of 310 mOsm/kg (reference range, 275\u2013295 mOsm/kg). His vision continued to diminish after admission. His management included fomepizole infusion, hemodialysis, thiamine infusion, and application of sodium bicarbonate boluses. Two days after admission, his laboratory markers normalized and he was discharged back to his normal condition, except for his vision derangement where he was referred to an ophthalmology specialized clinic where follow-up was lost.\n\nOur fourth patient was a 25-year-old woman with a history of iron deficiency anemia who presented to the ED complaining of shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, left flank pain, blurry vision, and palpitations. These symptoms had progressed over the last 3 days with alcohol consumption before she presented at our institution. The patient was conscious and oriented to time, place, and person. Her initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 138/94 mmHg; heart rate, 104 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 4.7 mmol/L. Her venous blood gas pH was 7.32 and HCO3 level was 15 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 280 mOsm/kg and the anion gap was 15 mEq/L. During admission, she received four doses of fomepizole infusion as per the institution poison control center protocol (0.9 g intravenous loading dose then 0.6 g q 12 hours). After completion of therapy, she was discharged home in her normal baseline condition.\n\nThe fifth patient was a 20-year-old woman who had been admitted and treated in another hospital for 1 week for acidosis and intoxication. She presented to our ED complaining of a 2-day history of bilateral complete vision loss. She had no other complaints. Her initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 107/55 mmHg; heart rate, 54 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 99% in room air; and glucose level, 6 mmol/L. Her venous blood gas pH was 7.3 and HCO3 level was 14.9 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 278 mOsm/kg, and the anion gap was 15 mEq/L. Upon admission, the patient received fomepizole infusion and was admitted for 3 days, during which time her condition improved, and she regained her vision. No hemodialysis was required. Patient was lost to follow-up after referral to ophthalmology.\n\nOur sixth patient was a 27-year-old man who presented with complaints of vomiting and severe abdominal pain, restlessness, and blurry vision after alcohol consumption 2 days prior to his visit to our institution. His initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 134/90 mmHg; heart rate, 84 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/minute; oxygen saturation, 98% in room air; and glucose level, 4.7 mmol/L. His venous blood gas showed a pH of 7.1, and the HCO3 level was 5 mEq/L. The measured serum osmolality was 296 mOsm/kg and the anion gap was 33 mEq/L. Fomepizole, thiamine, folic acid, sodium bicarbonate infusion, and hemodialysis treatment were started. During his hospital stay, he received fomepizole as per the poison control center institution protocol (15 mg/kg intravenous loading dose of fomepizole followed by 10 mg/kg q 6 hours during his dialysis). He remained on continuous renal replacement therapy for 24 hours. He was discharged the next day after improvement and resolution of all his symptoms.\n\nThe seventh patient was a 36-year-old man who presented with complaints of fatigue, loss of appetite, and chest pain after consumption of alcohol 2 days prior to his visit to our institution. He had no visual symptoms and his GCS score was 15. The initial pH of his venous blood gas was 7.2, and the HCO3 level was 15 mEq/L. Serum osmolality was 277 mOsm/kg. He was administered fomepizole, folic acid, and sodium bicarbonate treatments and was soon discharged in good condition.\n\nOur eighth patient was a 19-year-old woman with no history of serious diseases, who presented with acidosis, abdominal pain, vomiting, and blurred vision 2 days after the consumption of contaminated alcohol. The pH of her venous blood gas was 7.1, and the serum osmolality was 278 mOsm/kg. She was started on continuous renal replacement therapy upon admission, and given fomepizole, folinic acid, bicarbonate infusion until resolution of her symptoms was achieved. She was discharged back to her normal healthy baseline, with a referral to ophthalmology for follow-up.\n\nThe ninth patient was a 20-year-old woman who developed abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and blurred vision after attending a party. Analysis of her venous blood sample showed a pH of 7.34 and HCO3 level of 18 mEq/L. She was started on continuous renal replacement therapy upon admission and started on fomepizole infusion as per the poison control center institution protocol (15 mg/kg intravenous loading dose of fomepizole followed by 10 mg/kg q 6 hours during dialysis). She continued on treatment until resolution of her symptoms the next day. She was discharged back to her normal healthy baseline, with a referral to ophthalmology for follow-up.",

Our patient was descended from a nonconsanguineous parent. Her mother was completely asymptomatic, while her father had been diagnosed with the same condition when he was 42 years of age, and he had been on hemodialysis for the last few years because of chronic renal failure. The pattern of this disease inheritance in her family suggested an X-linked type, as her brothers were asymptomatic. At the same time, her only sister had shown hematuria since she was a teenager. Genetic testing was offered to the patient and her offspring but declined as the test was not insured financially.\n\nAfter three successful pregnancies and 3 years from her last delivery, the patient is normotensive, had a normal kidney function test, and was not undergoing any specific treatment. However, recently she had been found to have some auditory changes from tinnitus, mild neurosensory hearing loss, and mild lenticular myopia caused by her anterior lenticonus.\n\nFirst pregnancy (2009)  \nAt the age of 23, the patient came to the antenatal clinics at 7 weeks of gestation, and an early ultrasound examination confirmed a pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and the blood pressure was 90/70 mmHg.

Twenty-four-hour urine collection measured 1.870 g protein. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth assessment, proteinuria, and kidney function testing. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted to the obstetric unit for monitoring because of rising proteinuria of 4.300 g in 24 hours and a borderline amniotic fluid index at 34 weeks. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg.\n\nAt 37 weeks of gestation, 24-hour urine collection measured 5.694 g protein, creatinine 49 \u00b5mol/l, total protein 53.4 g/l (60\u201380 g/l), and albumin at 27.8 g/l (35\u201352 g/l). She had a cesarean section at 37 completed weeks for an obstetric reason (breech presentation) and delivered a healthy, 2530 g female newborn baby. Proteinuria dropped down to the early pregnancy levels shortly after delivery. The patient recovered smoothly after surgery and was discharged home with her newborn infant. The patient had a follow-up visit at the nephrology clinic after 2 weeks of her puerperium, which revealed proteinuria of +2 and creatinine of 52 \u00b5mol/l. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the second pregnancy.\n\nSecond pregnancy (2015)  \nAt age 30, the patient came once more to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 13 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg. There was a +1 protein in the urine, and the creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth and fetal well-being assessments, as well as the recording of proteinuria and creatinine levels. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted at 30 weeks of gestation so that her borderline amniotic fluid index could be assessed. At 34 weeks of gestation, the patient had an elevated blood pressure of 140/89 mmHg, for which she was again admitted to the hospital for observation. Proteinuria was 3.900 g in a 24-hour collection, serum creatinine was 44 \u00b5mol/l, hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dl, and the platelet count was 222 \u00d7 10^3/mm^3. The total serum protein was 51 g/l, albumin was 27.0 g/l, normal levels of alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase being 8.9 U/l and 15 U/l, respectively. She had a cesarean section due to a suspected dehiscence scar and gave birth to a male newborn infant weighing 2300 g, who was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The mother\u2019s proteinuria and blood pressure dropped shortly after 2 weeks of her delivery. The mother and the newborn infant were discharged home in good health. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the third pregnancy.\n\nThird pregnancy (2017)  \nAt age 32, the patient presented to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 12 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. A 24-hour urine collection showed 1.010 g in 2400 ml. The serum creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetrics and nephrology care was established with serial growth and fetal well-being assessment. At 28 weeks, during a routine antenatal visit, a dipstick for protein showed +3, while the 24-hour urine collection revealed 2.400 g in 1300 ml. Her blood pressure was normal all through her antenatal period. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. At 34 weeks, the protein in the 24-hour urine collection measured 2.900 g in 1200 ml, while serum creatinine was 45 \u00b5mol/l and hemoglobin level 9.1 g/dl. A cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks for obstetric reasons, and a male newborn of 2500 g was delivered and sent to the nursery. After 2 days, the mother and her newborn infant were discharged home. After 4 weeks, the patient was reevaluated once more, and she was doing well, with a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg and a 24-hour urine collection measuring 1.700 g in 2200 ml. There were no auditory or ophthalmological complaints. Late follow-up was lost apart from a few visits documented to the auditory and ophthalmology clinics.",
    "rewritten_case": "A Mediterranean woman in her mid-thirties, who had been diagnosed with a familial chronic renal disease during her childhood, was investigated for hematuria and proteinuria. This condition had also been diagnosed in her father, who had been on hemodialysis for several years due to chronic renal failure. The inheritance pattern of the disease in her family suggested an X-linked type, as her brothers were asymptomatic. Her sister, however, had also shown hematuria since adolescence. She herself, despite being a carrier of the condition, had maintained normal kidney function and was normotensive, with no specific treatment required. Genetic testing was offered but declined due to financial constraints.\n\nDespite her condition, she had been able to successfully go through multiple pregnancies. During these periods of gestation, she was under close monitoring for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia, and her proteinuria and kidney function were regularly tested. In one of her pregnancies, she was admitted for monitoring due to rising proteinuria and a borderline amniotic fluid index. She had a cesarean section for obstetric reason, and delivered a healthy female newborn baby. Proteinuria dropped to pre-pregnancy levels shortly post-delivery. \n\nIn another episode of pregnancy, she was admitted to the hospital due to elevated blood pressure and was kept under observation. She had a cesarean section due to a suspected dehiscence scar and delivered a male newborn infant. Proteinuria and blood pressure dropped shortly post-delivery.\n\nIn a different episode of pregnancy, she was under close observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. During this pregnancy, a dipstick for protein showed +3, and she had a cesarean section for obstetric reasons, delivering a male newborn. \n\nIn between her pregnancies and during the postpartum periods, the patient was found to have auditory changes from tinnitus, mild neurosensory hearing loss, and mild lenticular myopia caused by her anterior lenticonus. However, she reported no auditory or ophthalmological complaints during her last evaluation. Follow-up visits were lost, save for a few visits to the auditory and ophthalmology clinics.",

She had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 5 weeks before her visit, which was detected because she was in close contact with her husband who had COVID-19. She remained asymptomatic for 10 days during the COVID-19 isolation period; however, she began to feel general fatigue and back pain 3 days later. She complained of bilateral upper back pain without irradiation. This condition was moderate in severity and was not relieved by rest. Her appetite was hindered owing to abdominal bloating, frequent belching, and constipation. She lost 4 kg of weight in 3 weeks and was admitted to the hospital. She had a history of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and oral allergy syndrome to melon and watermelon with eosinophilia. Absolute eosinophil count was 1645/\u00b5L, 26% of white blood cell count, on the laboratory data 1 year before. Although she had been experiencing numbness in her bilateral hands for 3 months, she did not take it seriously, assuming it was due to her daily manual labor. A month before, she had been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome at another clinic. She was given a budesonide/formoterol inhaler, montelukast, theophylline, mirogabalin, and methyl-cobalamin, which is conventionally prescribed for peripheral neuropathy in Japan. Her blood pressure was 142/115 mmHg, pulse rate was 113 beats per minute, body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 99% on ambient air. Physical examination revealed slight inspiratory fine crackles on the left chest but no wheezing. Cardiac auscultation revealed no gallops or murmurs, and cervical inspection showed no jugular venous distention. A pale rash was observed, which changed to palpable erythema on the entire back  in a week. No eruptions were observed on the chest, abdomen, and extremities. She presented with sensory disturbances in the bilateral median nerve territories, as well as a positive Phalen test and Tinel sign. Lower limb hypoesthesia and weakness of the left tibialis anterior muscle were observed. Generalized hyperreflexia was also observed, but it was not accompanied by pathological reflexes. The eyes, nose, thyroid gland, abdomen, and superficial lymph nodes showed no abnormalities. Fig. 1 Palpable erythema, without pruritic or painful sensation, was present on the whole back in a reticulated pattern, colored light brown to light red. Laboratory results revealed an absolute eosinophil count of 11,956/\u00b5L, as well as elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, positive rheumatoid factor, and negative anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA). Liver and kidney function tests were normal, and urinalysis revealed no proteinuria, hematuria, or cast.  summarizes the major laboratory data. Electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia. Left ventricular ejection fraction was normal, and there was no evidence of ventricular hypertrophy, dilation including the right ventricle, valvular abnormality, or pericardial effusion on echocardiography. Bilateral patchy ground-glass opacity areas were observed on chest computed tomography (CT), which were indistinguishable from the residual COVID-19 lesion . There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism, or abnormal findings of abdomen on the contrast-enhanced CT. A nerve conduction study revealed signs of axonal injury, namely reduced amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials and normal sensory nerve conduction velocities in the bilateral median nerve and the right-sided ulnar and sural nerves. Normal distal latencies on the bilateral median nerves ruled out carpal tunnel syndrome. The physical examination findings, including anterior tibialis muscle weakness, indicated a mononeuritis multiplex pattern. Bone marrow aspiration demonstrated normal cellularity with increased eosinophil count of 65.2% without dysplasia, and FIP1L1\u2013PDGFRA fusion gene was negative on fluorescence in situ hybridization. A biopsy of the skin lesion showed perivascular and perineural eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation. There was no evidence of necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis or extravascular granulomas.

    "original_case": "A 68-year-old Caucasian male was referred to the emergency department with progressive complaints of fatigue, dyspnea, and poor appetite since 12 days. He had also fallen down and needed help getting back up. The patient was a retiree who had previously worked in law enforcement. He had no significant past medical history and did not take regular medications. He had a long-term history of smoking (80 pack-years) and consumed three alcoholic drinks daily. His general practitioner had noted a new diabetes mellitus with a glucose of 28 mmol/L when the patient presented in his practice 5 days earlier, but had not started treatment. The patient did not report coughing, chills, or chest pain. On physical examination, he appeared dyspneic and had an altered mental status but could still speak complete sentences. He had a blood pressure of 141/105 mmHg, pulse rate of 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% without supplemental oxygen, and temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. He had cold extremities with a capillary refill < 3 seconds. No other signs such as peripheral edema, heart murmurs, pericardial friction rub, or pulmonary crackles were present. Excepting the altered mental status, the global neurological examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 341 mg/L, neutrophilic leukocytosis with leukocyte count of 12.6 \u00d7 10^9/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 96 mmol/mol, mildly elevated hepatic transaminases, and low serum myocardial markers. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed partially compensated respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.49, pCO2 3.5 kPa, pO2 12.6 kPa, HCO3 19.4 mmol/L, base excess \u22122.4 mmol/L, sO2 97%) (see Additional file 1 for all laboratory values at first presentation). Chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis but no evident pleural effusion or infiltration . Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a QS pattern in V1\u20134, suggestive of an old anterior wall myocardial infarction. Point-of-care echocardiography was performed and visualized large, circumferential pericardial effusion . Also, wall motion abnormalities were seen that supported the theory that the patient had experienced an out-of-hospital anterior myocardial infarction in the weeks to months before the current presentation. The day after admission, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed with immediate drainage of 600 mL of purulent fluid. Analysis of the fluid indicated a leukocyte count of 267 \u00d7 10^9/L, total protein of 51 g/L, and lactate dehydrogenase pericardial fluid-to-serum ratio of 8.7. As Gram stains of blood revealed Gram-positive diplococci, antibiotic therapy consisting of continuous, intravenous infusion with 6 million international units benzylpenicillin daily was initiated. At admission, blood culture specimens for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria had been collected and directly transported to a BacT/Alert Virtuo system (BioM\u00e9rieux). Later on, these blood cultures as well as pericardial fluid cultures grew (serotype unknown). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that the isolated strain was susceptible to a variety of antibiotics including penicillin, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.016 mg/L. Initially, insulin and metformin were started for the newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Acetylsalicylic acid and low-molecular-weight heparin were started to prevent occlusive vascular events. Moreover, during the admission, several other medications were started for cardiovascular protection, to treat electrolyte imbalances, and to supplement vitamins because of the previous alcohol use (see Additional file 2 for all medication administered during admission). \n\nFig. 1 Chest X-ray showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette and left lower-lobe atelectasis with mild volume loss.

LV left ventricle, RV right ventricle Full size image \n\nIn the days following pericardiocentesis, a further 635 mL of purulent pericardial fluid was drained through the pericardial catheter and the patient\u2019s clinical condition improved markedly. Daily, bedside transthoracic echocardiography confirmed adequate drainage of the pericardial effusion. The patient did not develop any symptoms that pointed us in the direction of a primary focus (for instance, no coughing, urinary complaints, or back pains). Repeated chest X-rays did not show signs of pneumonia or empyema. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigen/antibody assay was negative, as were tests for other microorganisms (ELISpot for detection of M. tuberculosis; hepatitis C virus serology; and feces assays for C. difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and norovirus). The CRP level dropped to 102 mg/L. However, 6 days post-admission, the patient\u2019s condition suddenly deteriorated with a blood pressure of 100/66 mmHg, sinus tachycardia of 131 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute. A small amount of sanguineous fluid drained through the pericardial catheter. Echocardiography revealed reaccumulation of pericardial fluid including blood clot formation at the level of the right chamber in the pericardial cavity. Moreover, the wide inferior vena cava, right ventricular compression, and increased respiratory inflow variation (> 25%) over the mitral valve were indicative of cardiac tamponade. Attempts to clear the drain blockage by flushing with saline and adjusting the catheter\u2019s location in the pericardial cavity did not lead to evacuation of any pericardial fluid. Thus, as removal of the obstructing blood clot through the pericardial catheter proved impossible, the patient was transferred to a tertiary hospital to undergo emergent cardiothoracic surgery. Immediately before transfer, the patient went into cardiac arrest and he was ultimately transported with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Unfortunately, surgical removal of the clot proved unsuccessful, and the patient died only hours after onset of his sudden hemodynamic deterioration.

    "original_case": "A 28-year-old Ethiopian female came to University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital, northwestern Ethiopia, with a complaint of left axillary swelling of 3 years duration. The swelling was small initially and progressively increased in size to attain the current size. She had visited a nearby health center on multiple occasions for this complaint and took unspecified antibiotics, but experienced no improvement. Apart from the local mild pain and discomfort, there was no history of cough, fever, weight loss, night sweating, or other constitutional symptoms. She has no family history (first-degree relatives) of diabetes, hypertension, or any other remarkable noncommunicable disease including cancer. Her past medical history is not significant, except for occasional mild dyspeptic symptoms; she took unspecified over-the-counter anti-acids a couple of times for her dyspepsia as the symptoms arose. She has no history of admission to hospital. She has no history of any form of surgical procedure. She has no history of smoking. Except for the mild-to-moderate amount of local alcohol beverages she consumed on holidays, she has no history of excess alcohol consumption. She is a janitor in a public school. She is unmarried and lives with her parents. She has a fianc\u00e9 and uses a combination of natural calendar method and male condom for contraception. She has no history of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or injectable or intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) use. She has no history of pregnancy. She reported that she has regular menstrual cycles and no significant past obstetric or gynecologic history. On physical examination, her general appearance was stable, healthy looking, and ambulating. Vital signs were as follows: pulse rate, 82 beats per minute; blood pressure, 110/80 mmHg; respiratory rate, 18 breaths per minute; temperature, 36.2 \u00b0C. She has pink conjunctiva, non-icteric sclera, and no abnormal finding on head and neck examination. On lymphoglandular system (LGS) examination, there was an approximately 5\u2009\u00d7\u20094 cm solitary mass in the left axilla . It was firm in consistency, nontender, well defined, mobile, and completely separated from the left breast. Skin over the mass was normal with no nipple, areola, or ulceration. There were no clinically significant findings detected on examination of breasts, right axilla, or the other externally accessible lymph node regions. On chest examination, it was symmetrical and moved with respirations, and clear breath sounds were heard on auscultation. On precordial and cardiovascular examinations, the normal S1 and S2 heart sounds were heard, there was no murmur or gallop, and all the peripheral arterial pulses were palpable with strong and regular pulse. Abdomen was soft to palpation. No hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or mass was detected, and there were no signs of fluid collection. No costovertebral angle tenderness or abnormal finding was detected on genitourinary system (GUS) examination. No pedal or other subcutaneous edema was identified on musculoskeletal examination. No palmar pallor or skin lesions were seen on integumentary system examination. On neurologic examination, she was conscious, alert, and fully oriented to time, place, and person. Cranial nerve examination revealed normal findings. No motor or sensory deficit was detected, and deep tendon reflexes were normal. On the basis of the above findings, a provisional clinical impression of axillary lymphadenopathy due to either lymphoma or tuberculosis was considered. Fig. 1 Firm nodular mass in the left axilla Full size image Laboratory investigations done on the same day of her presentation including complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and chest X-ray were noncontributory. On CBC, white blood cell (WBC) count was 5900/mL with 53% granulocytes, 42% lymphocytes, 1% eosinophils, and 4% monocytes. Platelet count was 247,000/mL. Hemoglobin was 13.4 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 89 fL. ESR was 13 mm/hour. Renal function test revealed blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 13 mg/dL, and serum creatinine level was 0.78 mg/dL. On liver function test, total bilirubin was 0.7 mg/dL, serum albumin was 4.4 g/dL, and serum aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT/SGPT) were 29 and 33 IU/L respectively. All of these laboratory test results were within the normal reference range of our laboratory. Urinalysis was also done, and it was normal. Owing to the limited number of pathologists and long waiting list of patients, she was scheduled for fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Two weeks after her initial presentation, FNAC from the mass was done and smears were stained with Wright\u2019s stain following the standard procedures. Microscopic examination revealed cellular aspirates of tight cohesive clusters of bland ductal cells in branching stag-horn-like pattern along with numerous scattered bare nuclei on the background and fibromyxoid stromal fragments . Lymphoid cells were not seen. Abdominopelvic ultrasound and echocardiography were normal.

    "original_case": "A 36-year-old nulliparous Nigerian petty trader presented at the gynecology outpatient clinic with a painless abdominal mass of 1-year duration. The mass first appeared as a small induration and progressively increased in size. She had menarche at age 14 years, with 3 days of menstruation in a 28-day cycle. There was no history of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and bowel or urinary change, and no significant past medical history although she was taking the antihypertensive amlodipine (tablet, 10 mg daily) for hypertension. She had a surgical history of open myomectomy for symptomatic fibroids 3 years prior to presentation. There was no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus, asthma, cancer or sickle cell disease. She defined herself as a social drinker and non-smoker (no history of smoking). The results of a prior ultrasound examination at a different hospital suggested a condition, and based on this scan, she was offered a hysterectomy at that hospital prior to her presentation at our own facility. General and neurological examinations were unremarkable, with a pulse rate of 74 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, and a body temperature of 36.2 \u00b0C. Abdominal with bimanual pelvic examination revealed a giant abdominopelvic mass, equivalent to a 36-week gestational uterus, extending in all directions to fill the abdominal cavity. It was not attached to the overlying structures but seemed to have originated from the pelvic cavity. Subsequently, based on evidence of this abdominopelvic mass, we carried out a preoperative work-up, with the results showing a packed cell volume (PCV) of 36%, fasting blood sugar of 80 mg/dl, blood group O+ (positive), sero-negativity for hepatitis B and C, and normal values for urinalysis, electrolytes, urea, and creatinine. The abdominopelvic scan revealed an anteverted, empty, and markedly bulky uterus that measured about 283 \u00d7 156 mm, with the fundus close to the xiphisternum. The endometrial stripe measured about 4 mm in thickness, with what appeared to be diffuse enlargement of the uterine myometrium with no succinct myometrial mass. There was no adnexal mass and no fluid in the Pouch of Douglas. The visceral organs showed nothing of significance. A computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were not performed due to the unavailability of these facilities. Two units of whole blood were cross matched for her, and she then underwent an exploratory laparotomy for the excision of the tumor. Intra-operation findings included a huge 6.5-kg abdominal mass of firm consistency and 40 cm in diameter . There was adhesion of the omentum with markedly enlarged omental vessels. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries appeared to be normal. There was no retroperitoneal involvement. However, there was an extension of the tumor to the left sub-umbilical part of the abdominal wall. Complete excision of the tumor with a wide margin and partial omentectomy was carried out, and the anterior abdominal wall was closed in layers without prosthesis. The postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. The histology study showed a specific type of fibromatosis with an unremarkable fibrofatty tissue stalk excision margin (Fig. 2 a, b).",

The mass, initially a small induration, had gradually increased in size. Her first menarche happened at age 14, and she had regular menstrual cycles every 28 days, lasting for 3 days. She had no history of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, bowel or urinary changes, or significant past medical issues apart from hypertension, for which she took a daily 10mg tablet of amlodipine.

In addition, there was no specific medication, smoking history, or alcohol consumption. The cause of the accident was a methanol-based paint spill on his clothes that ignited; this incident occurred at a plating factory (Fig. 1: day 1). He was transferred to our hospital for emergency treatment. On arrival, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 165/102 mmHg, and pulse rate of 90/minute. His body temperature was 37.3 degrees Celsius. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was E4 V5 M6, and there was no motor or sensory paralysis. Physical examination revealed 25% total-body-surface-area flame injuries (7% partial thickness on the trunk and right hand and 18% full thickness on the right arm, both legs, and chest). There were no problems with hand function. On day 2 after admission, the wounds on his two thighs and right arm were debrided, and Integra dermal regeneration templates (Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA) were applied. On day 9 after admission, the wounds on his right lower leg, right arm, and chest were debrided, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. On day 16 after admission, the Integra silicone sheet was removed, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. Epithelialization had occurred in most parts of the injury; however, the graft failed in the proximal one-third portion of the left thigh, resulting in an ulcer. With topical treatment with a silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing (Aquacel\u00ae Ag BURN: ConvaTec, Princeton, NJ, USA) for 6 days, petroleum gel (PROPETO\u00ae; Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 6 days, a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb, Maruho, Osaka, Japan) for 3 days, and silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh; ALCARE, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 days, the ulcer was covered with healthy granulation tissue (Fig. 1: day 36).

The meshed split-thickness skin graft (STSG) was fixed, and NPWT was applied to both the donor and recipient sites Full size image On day 37 after admission, an operation was performed. The ulcer surface was debrided, and an 11/1000-inch (0.28 mm) skin graft was taken from the ipsilateral thigh and meshed, using a 1:1.5 ratio. A slightly larger skin graft was taken, and the excess skin graft was immediately regrafted to the donor site. The regrafted skin was meshed using a 1:1.5 ratio, the same as the recipient site. NPWT (INFOV.A.C.\u2122 Therapy System, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) was then applied to both the donor and recipient sites with a continuous negative pressure of 125 mmHg. A silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh) was inserted between the skin graft and polyurethane foam dressing (V.A.C. GranuFoam Dressing, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) to avoid damage to the skin graft (Fig. 1: day 37). On days 37 and 38 after admission, 1 g of cefazolin was administered intravenously every 8 hours as perioperative prophylaxis. On day 43 after admission, the polyurethane foam dressing was removed from both the donor and recipient sites. Although the regrafted skin at the donor site was taken completely, the skin graft was not found at the recipient site, and the entire area was covered with granulation tissue (Fig. 2: day 43, left). No granulation tissue overgrowth was observed at the donor site. The staples that had held the grafts in place were embedded in the granulation tissue and were removed. On the same day, the wound was cleaned under running tap water, and small islands of epithelialization were visible under the granulation tissue. NPWT was ceased, and topical treatment with a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb) was applied (Fig. 2: day 43, right). Rapid epithelialization of the ulcer was observed as the granulation tissue regressed, and epithelialization of both the donor and recipient sites was almost completed on day 48 after admission (5 days after NPWT cessation) (Fig. 2: day 48). No significant change was observed between pre- and postoperative laboratory findings (). In addition, no significant findings were observed in urinalysis on day 17 (), and no further urinalysis was performed during hospitalization because no specific symptoms appeared.

His blood results showed a hemoglobin level of 130 (111\u2013147) g/L, a white blood cell count of 8.1 \u00d7 10^9/L (4.5 \u00d7 10^9/L to 14.5 \u00d7 10^9/L), and a platelet count of 274 \u00d7 10^9/L (150 \u00d7 10^9/L to 450 \u00d7 10^9/L). His serum sodium level was 127 (136\u2013145) mmol/L. Normal results were shown in his renal function tests, liver function tests, and thyroid profile. He tested positive for islet cell antibodies, and his glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were significantly elevated at over 2000 (<5) U/ml. His celiac screen was negative, and HbA1C level was elevated [116 mmol/mol (20\u201341 mmol/mol International Federation of Clinical Chemistry standardization)].\n\nA follow-up home visit by the Paediatric Diabetic Specialist Nursing (PDSN) team, 11 days post-diagnosis, showed his blood sugar level had returned to a normal range. During the visit, he was observed to be jaundiced with icteric sclera, and he reported extreme lethargy and malaise. He was then referred to the acute pediatric observation and assessment unit. Upon examination, no hepatomegaly was detected, and apart from the icteric sclera, there were no signs of chronic liver disease. All clinical observations were within normal limits.\n\nA significant finding in this case was the results of the ophthalmic examination that showed signs of retinopathy, even though the patient didn't present any vision complaints or visible macular edema. Additional blood work showed a hemoglobin level of 81 (111\u2013147) g/L with a low red blood cell count 2.65 \u00d7 10^12/L (3.9 \u00d7 10^12/L to 5.2 \u00d7 10^12/L). His urea and electrolytes were normal. Liver functions revealed raised bilirubin\u201488 (3\u201321) \u03bcmol/L with a conjugated fraction of 6 \u03bcmol/L. His serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, and serum albumin levels were within the normal range. \n\nThe presence of retinopathy, despite the absence of macular edema and vision complaints, added complexity to the case, potentially indicating a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy.

The patient had a history of alcohol and tobacco use but otherwise no significant medical history. His left forearm was caught between the motor vehicle and the road, and became highly compressed and retracted. The patient was hemodynamically stable with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15, a blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, body temperature of 36.1 \u00b0C, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Laboratory test results were as follows: hemoglobin 16.3 g/dL; hematocrit 46%; white blood cells 8100/mm3, with no left shift; platelets 195,000/mm3; urea 14.5 mg/dL; creatinine 0.8 mg/dL; total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL; direct bilirubin 0.07 mg/dL. Major vascular and visceral injuries were not suspected. Physical examination and radiography showed an open radial shaft fracture with marked swelling of the left forearm . The patient was given 0.5 mL of tetanus toxoid vaccine intramuscularly and administered prophylactic antibiotic using intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g. Compartment pressure was measured in three different areas of the forearm, showing 40 mmHg in the volar component and 30 mmHg in the dorsal forearm compartment. Five hours after the injury, surgery was performed under general anesthesia. First, we made a curvilinear skin incision on the volar aspect of the forearm from the biceps tendon to the palm of the hand for carpal tunnel release . We performed a debridement of the involved muscles; however, we could not perform an internal fixation or immediate reconstruction owing to the risk of advancing the myonecrosis of the forearm muscles. After release of the superficial and deep flexor compartments, pressure in the dorsal compartment decreased. The wound was closed with vessel tape, utilizing the shoelace technique. After the release, the patient was not able to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. At second-look operation (3 days after the initial release), swelling of the left forearm had reduced with no evidence of infection. Therefore, we performed open reduction and internal fixation for the left radius fracture and PL tendon transfer to the FPL tendon. Intraoperatively, the presence of the intact PL tendon was confirmed. The PL tendon was advanced to the FPL tendon, and an interlacing suture was performed thrice. The tendon was transferred with the wrist in 30\u00b0 of dorsiflexion and the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the thumb in 45\u00b0 of flexion. The wrist and thumb were immobilized in a slightly flexed position using a splint for 3 weeks, following which active flexion and extension exercises of the thumb were started. The patient was discharged 32 days after hospital admission in a relatively good state of health. Six weeks after the reconstruction, passive extension exercises of the thumb were started. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had no complaints and had returned to his former job, despite slight residual muscle weakness of the FPL. The patient regained the full range of thumb interphalangeal joint flexion\u2013extension. At 2-year follow-up, the patient had acquired 88% of pinch strength compared with the contralateral hand and scored 11.4 on QuickDASH score.",

Five hours post-injury, the patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia.

She had a chief complaint of occipital headache which was associated with dizziness and projectile vomiting for over a year. She had no history of chronic illness. She had three children, and all childbirths were done by cesarean section. She had no previous history of blood transfusion. She had no history of malignancy or cancer within her family. She worked as a nurse. She was married. She denied a history of use of tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs. All vitals were within normal limits. Physical examination was essentially normal. Neurological findings showed that all cranial nerves were within normal limits, and there was no motor or sensory deficit, but she had poor coordination of movement. Basic laboratory investigations were done and included: complete blood count (WBC-4.92\u2009\u00d7\u200910^3/uL, Hb-12.3 g/dl and platelet-165.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910^3/uL), urea (5.5 mmol/L), serum creatinine (85.19 micromol/L), alanine aminotransferase (23.1 IU/L), Aspartate aminotransferase (30.1 IU/L), total bilirubin (0.19 mg/dl), and albumin (38.45 g/L) essentially normal with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test. Brain MRI was conducted  and showed a left posterior fossa mass, which had an iso-hypointense appearance on T1-weighted images, an inhomogeneously enhanced appearance on T1-weighted contrast images and iso-hyperintensity on T2-weighted images .\n\nA ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedure was conducted before surgery to overcome hydrocephalus. Craniotomy for the posterior fossa tumor was done . The patient was placed in prone position with her head supported on the Mayfield head holder. A posterior midline suboccipital approach was used. Through the displaced left cerebellar, a grayish solid mass, with an undefined border, was identified and dissected carefully with cauterization of the feeder vessels. Subtotal tumor resection (STR) was done, and hemostasis was achieved. Dura closure was achieved with a dura patch, and the bone flap was returned. Wound closure was done in layers. A histopathology sample from the mass was obtained. The postsurgery phase was uneventful. Histopathology revealed cells with minimal cytoplasm and dense basophilic nuclei present in diffuse sheets (Figs. 3 and 4). Reticulin staining was not done because it was not available. Immunohistochemical analysis and molecular subgroup were also not performed because they were not available.\n\nWe did not carry out CSF analysis to investigate the leptomeningeal spread of the tumor due to concerns about transtentorial herniation. We conducted MRI of the brain and spine at 1 month after surgery , which revealed a residual posterior fossa tumor without leptomeningeal spread. We stratified the tumor as high risk, and the staging was modified to Chang stage M0. \n\nShe was simulated by using CT\u2013Simulator in supine position. The headrest and a thermoplastic head and neck mask were used to restrain the head. Contouring was done for the target and the organs at risk. Laterally parallel opposed fields with photon energy of 6 MV were used to treat the brain , and two direct posterior adjacent fields were used to treat the spinal cord . Collimator rotation was used to match the cranial and spinal fields, and a feathering maneuver was used in the two adjusted spine fields to avoid hotspots. The radiotherapy technique was 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) using a linear accelerator (LINAC). The patient underwent two phases of treatment. The first phase was craniospinal radiation therapy (CSRT) whereby 36 Gy in 20 fractions was delivered, and the second phase was the posterior cranial fossa boost, whereby a boost dose of 18 Gy in 10 fractions was delivered.

    "original_case": "A 65-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital with a 12-hour history of diffuse colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain had arisen suddenly and presented a gross localization to the upper quadrants. He had failed to pass feces and gas for the last 2 days and reported no significant abdominal symptoms before the event except for mild stypsis. His past medical history included a previous thoracoscopic mitral valve repair and mild renal insufficiency secondary to ectopic hypoplastic left kidney located in the pelvis. He had no history of previous abdominal surgery. Upon physical examination, we found significant abdominal distension, severe spontaneous pain in the upper abdomen without guarding or positive Blumberg sign, and tympany on percussion. The body temperature was 37 \u00b0C, and all vital parameters were normal. Digital rectal examination revealed empty ampulla with normal fecal residues. A nasogastric tube was positioned, and about 400 ml of biliary effluent was drained.\n\nBlood tests revealed neutrophilia (leukocytes 9.98 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl; neutrophils 9.08 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 65 mg/L). Abdominal X-ray, in turn, showed diffuse abdominal distension of both small and large bowel with multiple air\u2013fluid levels. The small bowel presented valvulae conniventes without mucosal thickening, while the large bowel showed coprostasis and regular haustration. Cecum diameter measured about 6 cm .\n\nFig. 1\nAbdominal X-ray\nFull size image\nAbdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was thus performed showing an anatomical abnormality of the colon and diffuse dilation of both the small bowel and colon. The sigmoid colon was elongated and formed a distended loop in the subhepatic recess above the right flexure. Cecum and ascending colon were in their normal position, while the left ectopic kidney was found on the left side of the pelvis. Pancreas, duodenum, right kidney, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric artery had no significant abnormalities .\n\nFig. 2\nCoronal view of abdominal Computed tomography scan (from anterior to posterior): (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery\nFull size image\nImportantly, the lack of left kidney bulk in the left flank altered the course of the colonic portions corresponding to the splenic flexure and descending segment. The splenic flexure was twisted counterclockwise on the frontal plane, causing the descending colon to be more medial and posterior. The latter therefore crossed posteriorly to the body of pancreas near the L2 vertebral body and descended anteriorly to the psoas muscle. From there onward, the course of the sigmoid colon could be divided into four segments. The first segment began in the left iliac fossa, turning right and crossing the midline at the level of the L5\u2013S1 intervertebral disc near the upper pole of the left ectopic kidney. The second segment turned sharply upward directed to the subhepatic recess running anterior to the inferior vena cava and crossing the right common iliac artery anteriorly and the ileocolic vessels and proximal transverse colon posteriorly. The third segment formed a dilated loop in contact with the gallbladder and the lower aspect of the right hepatic lobe. The fourth segment continued in an inferior direction running along the right side of the inferior vena cava, crossing the right side of the promontory, and terminating in the rectum. Since the third part was dilated to 5 cm in diameter and the second and fourth parts were compressed, the sigmoid colon appeared to be involved in a closed-loop occlusion. A C-shaped fluid-filled loop of ileum with beak-like proximal and distal narrowing was found near the fourth part of sigmoid colon, resembling a closed-loop small bowel obstruction. Both the ileal loop and the sigmoid colon appeared to be incarcerated in a narrow space behind the ileocolic vessels.\n\nThe inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was also characterized by an abnormal course. This originated from the aorta 2.5 cm above the aortic bifurcation and ran rightward, giving rise to a long recurrent left colic artery and some directed upward sigmoid branches. It then turned downward into the pelvis as the superior hemorrhoidal artery. The left colic artery had an extremely long course: it originated from the IMA via a common trunk with the first sigmoid artery to the right side of the aorta and crossed it running left and upward. The left renal artery originated on the anterior face of the aortic bifurcation and flowed downward to the ectopic kidney located on the left in the small pelvis .\n\nFig. 3\nSchematic drawing of the anatomical abnormalities. (1) ascending colon; (2) transverse colon; (3) splenic flexure; (4) descending colon; (5) sigmoid colon: a first, b second, c third, d fourth part; (6) incarcerated ileal loop; (7) ileocolic artery; (8) right common iliac artery; (9) inferior mesenteric artery; (10) left colic artery; (11) left renal artery; (12) first sigmoid artery; (13) inferior vena cava; (14) aorta; (15) ectopic left kidney\nFull size image\nGiven the complex anatomy, we opted for exploratory laparoscopy, which revealed a recess on the right posterior peritoneum traversed by the sigmoid colon. An ileal loop was trapped within this space, resulting in an internal hernia with upstream bowel dilation. This recess was limited anteriorly by Toldt\u2019s fascia, the ascending colon and adhesions spanning between the ascending colon and the abdominal wall. These adhesions were similar to the Ladd\u2019s bands described in malrotations. The ileal loop was extracted from the recess and did not appear ischemic, with deflation ensuing shortly after this procedure. The sigmoid colon was then extracted, revealing thick adhesions between the sigmoid colon and the posterior abdominal wall forcing the sigmoid colon to recoil inside the recess once traction from laparoscopic clamp was eased. Given the inability to safely lyse these adhesions, we decided to convert to open surgery. The adhesions of the sigmoid colon and its mesosigmoid with the retroperitoneum were partially lysed, allowing the sigmoid colon to remain in natural position without tension. Thereafter, a suture of the hernial breach was performed between the lower edge of Toldt\u2019s fascia and the retroperitoneum. We did not perform complete lysis of sigmoid colon adhesions as this would have led to the complete mobilization of a dolichosigma with significant risk of volvulus. The procedure was completed with appendicectomy and positioning of abdominal drainage in the pelvis .\n\nFig. 4\nIntraoperative images:\na ileal loop and sigmoid colon in the hernia breach.\nb Ileal loop was extracted from the hernia breach, and the sigmoid colon was carefully extracted.\nc Complete extraction of sigmoid colon shows fixation with the retroperitoneum (1) sigmoid colon; (2) incarcerated ileal loop; (3) adhesions between ascending colon and abdominal wall; (4) ascending colon; (5) adhesions between sigmoid colon and right peritoneum; (6) hernial breach.\nS cranial, I caudal, L left, R right\nFull size image",

His past medical history included a thoracoscopic mitral valve repair and mild renal insufficiency due to an ectopic hypoplastic left kidney positioned in the pelvis.

The cecum and ascending colon were in their normal positions, while the left ectopic kidney was found on the left side of the pelvis.

This suggested possible intestinal obstruction, although the exact cause was not immediately clear. Both the ileal loop and the sigmoid colon appeared to be trapped in a narrow space behind the ileocolic vessels.\n\nConsidering the complex anatomy, the medical team decided on an exploratory laparoscopy. This revealed a recess on the right posterior peritoneum traversed by the sigmoid colon. An ileal loop was found trapped within this space, resulting in upstream bowel dilation. Given the intricate nature of the sigmoid colon adhesions, the decision was made to convert to open surgery. The hernial breach was sutured between the lower edge of Toldt\u2019s fascia and the retroperitoneum, and an appendectomy was performed. However, due to the presence of the C-shaped fluid-filled loop of ileum and the overall clinical picture, the working diagnosis was revised to unspecified intestinal obstruction. This was considered a plausible diagnosis given the diffuse dilation of both the small bowel and colon, and the ileal loop and sigmoid colon being trapped in a narrow space. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings were consistent with a diagnosis of intestinal obstruction.",

The child was third born to second-degree consanguineous parents by lower-segment cesarean section due to cephalopelvic disproportion. Birth weight was 3.1 kg with uneventful perinatal history. There was maternal history of normal healthy live birth in the first pregnancy and spontaneous miscarriages in second and fourth pregnancies in early trimesters. The fourth pregnancy was associated with Down syndrome. The mother was given antenatal progesterone for excess bleeding in the first trimester. From 2 weeks of age, she presented with lethargy, sweating, and breathlessness on feeding. Later on, she presented with recurrent episodes of aspirations with severe lower respiratory infections. Cardiac examination revealed a holosystolic murmur suggestive of ventricular septal defect (VSD). Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with features suggestive of pneumonia . Echocardiography (ECHO) showed moderate VSD (6\u20137 cm subaortic perimembranous VSD), dilated left atrium and left ventricle, trivial aortic regurgitation with aortic cusp collapse, dilated pulmonary artery system with flow acceleration across pulmonary valve, and half-systemic pulmonary artery pressure with normal left ventricular systolic function . There was no pericardial effusion or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. She was managed medically with decongestive medications and antibiotics for lower respiratory infections. She was noted to have laryngomalacia. At 3 months of age, decreased motor movements were noted. She was gaining weight till 5 months of age, after which there was flattening of the growth curve and failure to thrive. At 6 months, she had developmental arrest followed by progressive neuroregression. She also had severe startle response since 8 months of age. Then, she started having generalized recurrent seizures from 9 months onward. The epileptic episodes were mostly focal with secondary generalization, with the most severe event reported as having frequency of ten seizure episodes within 2 hours time period despite anticonvulsant therapy. She had also macrocephaly with coarse facial features, persistent laryngomalacia, and hyperacusis. There was no muscle atrophy. Central hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, and a positive Babinski reflex were elicited. Organomegaly was absent. Ophthalmological examination showed bilateral macular cherry-red spots and an inability to fixate the eyes. At 12 months, she developed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as reactive airway disease. Gastrostomy tube feeding was also commenced. She had frequent episodes of hospitalizations due to repeated aspiration pneumonia, reactive airway diseases, and other central nervous system complications.

In view of cherry-red spots and coarse facies, GM1 gangliosidosis was also considered. No significant abnormality was noted in complete blood count, electrolytes, or renal and liver function tests. Ultrasonography of abdomen did not reveal any hydronephrosis or other anatomic abnormalities. Computerized tomography scan of brain without contrast was suggestive of mild bilateral symmetric hyperdensity of thalami . Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed slowing of delta frequencies associated with drowsiness. Video-fluoroscopic assessment for swallowing function was suggestive of aspiration on both fluoroscopic runs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed extensive high signal within the supratentorial white matter involving subcortical and deep white matter structures. There was evidence of T1-increased signal in the thalamus and a relatively large head shape. Bilaterally, the thalami demonstrated symmetric reduction of T2 signal and increase in the T1-weighted signal. There was marked delay in myelination as demonstrated on T1-weighted imaging. The corpus callosum was markedly thinned in its anterior body and genu. There was mild hypoplasia of the posterior arch of the C1 vertebra causing minimal narrowing at the upper cervical spinal canal .

The serum HEX A percentage was 100% (reference value 20\u201390%). This biochemical findings of low total HEX and deficient HEX B activities, with high percentage of HEX A/total HEX activity suggested the diagnosis of a lysosomal storage disorder. Oligosaccharide urine screen was positive in the urine sample, and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis with homozygous deletion c.(445+1_512-1)_(669+1_1170) in the HEXB gene.

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Japanese man with a chief complaint of hoarseness visited the Otolaryngology Department at our hospital. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a tumor, with its major axis measuring approximately 40 mm in the left upper lobe of the lung. The hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were also swollen . Primary lung cancer was suspected, and the patient was directed to the Department of Respiratory Medicine on the same day that he was admitted to the Otolaryngology Department. He was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by bronchoscopy. We performed transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) for the primary lesion in the left upper lobe and endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the mediastinal lymph nodes 1 week after the first visit. Genetic mutation testing was not performed because the sample was insufficient. Subsequently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) was performed, and abnormal accumulation was observed in the longitudinal hilar lymph nodes (#4L, #5, #10L), vertebral body, and left pleura. The results of the 18F-FDG PET/CT and other findings led to the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma [cT2bN2M1c (PUL, OSS); stage IVB]. We recommended rebiopsy considering the possibility of a genetic mutation, but the patient refused the examination because of strong coughing during the first bronchoscopy and progressive symptoms of hoarseness. The patient strongly desired an early treatment, so we initiated first-line therapy with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) 3 weeks after the first visit. However, the patient developed grade 2 renal dysfunction [creatinine, 1.83 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 31.23 mL/min/1.73 m2], making it difficult to continue the therapy . We informed the patient about the need for a second bronchoscopy for consideration of further treatment and obtained his consent. Bronchoscopy was performed again, and the patient was diagnosed with ALK-positive NSCLC (immunohistochemistry, 3+; fluorescence in situ hybridization, 56%). In addition, progressive disease was noted . Development of progressive disease required approximately 9 months, and cisplatin and pemetrexed were administered over four cycles, after which pemetrexed alone was administered over five cycles. Thereafter, second-line therapy with alectinib (300 mg/day) was initiated. Three months after starting alectinib, chest CT showed that the primary lesion had shrunk, and we judged it to be a partial response, but the ground-glass opacities and infiltration continued to spread on both sides (Figs. 1d, 2). At this time, the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion, and his saturation of percutaneous oxygen was approximately 82% in room air. Blood gas analysis showed that the partial pressure of arterial oxygen was 58.2 torr, indicating respiratory failure. A pulmonary function test revealed restrictive ventilatory impairment, with a vital capacity (VC) of 2.11 L and a %VC of 57.1%. A diffuse lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 4.84 mL/min/mmHg and a %DLCO of 22.8% indicated diffusion disorder. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)  and TBLB samples  were obtained at this time. The BALF showed an increased lymphocyte ratio (34.4%), and pathological analysis of the TBLB specimen revealed an organizing pneumonia (OP)/nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) overlapping pattern. On the basis of the chest CT results, we suspected alectinib-induced DILD. However, we also considered respiratory infection or cancerous lymphangiopathy with cancer progression in the differential diagnoses. Laboratory testing revealed a white blood cell count of 9300/\u00b5L and a C-reactive protein level of 1.41 mg/dL. The BALF culture results were negative. The BALF was lymphocyte dominant, and no findings suggestive of cancer infiltration were observed in the TBLB specimen. On the basis of these results, we excluded the other conditions evaluated in the differential diagnosis. On the basis of the results of chest CT and bronchoscopic pathology, methylprednisolone was prescribed (1 g/day for 3 days). The patient then received oral prednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day), which was gradually reduced, and he was administered steroids for about 3 months. Third-line therapy with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) (100 mg/m2) was initiated after treatment with steroids. However, 3 months later, obstructive pneumonia associated with an increase in the size of the primary lesion was observed . Moreover, mild renal dysfunction persisted (creatinine, 1.63 mg/dL; eGFR, 35.45 mL/min/1.73 m2). Because of this complication and upon the patient\u2019s request for oral medication, lorlatinib (100 mg/day) was administered as fourth-line therapy. Treatment with antibiotics and lorlatinib reduced the lesion\u2019s shadow, and no recurrence of DILD was observed. Thirty-three months after the start of treatment, stable disease has been maintained, and lorlatinib has been continued (Figs. 1f, 4).",

During the initial assessment, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan indicated a tumor, approximately 40 mm along its major axis, situated in the left upper lobe of the lung. The patient's hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were also notably swollen. The radiographic findings suggested primary lung cancer, prompting his transfer to the Department of Respiratory Medicine on the same day.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, affirmed by bronchoscopy. Our team conducted a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) on the primary lesion in the left upper lobe and endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration on the mediastinal lymph nodes a week after the initial visit. Unfortunately, the sample was insufficient for genetic mutation testing. \n\nSubsequently, the patient underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT).

While unusual, the team considered the possibility that the cancer or its treatment could have triggered this condition.\n\nWe obtained the patient's consent for a second bronchoscopy considering further treatment options. The bronchoscopy results identified the patient as having ALK-positive NSCLC (immunohistochemistry, 3+; fluorescence in situ hybridization, 56%).

He had hypertension and was a smoker, but was not diabetic and did not have any previous history of heart disease. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 105/70 mmHg; pulse rate, 95 beats per minute; respiration, 25 breaths per minute; and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, 96%. Lung examination revealed minimal bibasilar rales. The ECG conducted at the referring hospital showed upsloping ST depression in V2\u2013V4 and ST elevation in V7\u2013V9 . Serial ECG examination at our hospital showed a gradual resolution of ST depression in the anteroseptal region, despite persistent ST elevation in the posterior lead . Additionally, the troponin T value increased to 5413 ng/L. Echocardiography revealed a mild hypokinetic posterior wall with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%.\n\nFig. 1 Referring hospital 12-lead ECG.

He complained of typical chest pain for more than 20 hours. He had a history of smoking but was not hypertensive or diabetic, and did not have previously diagnosed heart disease. Upon admission to our hospital, his vital signs showed a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg with norepinephrine and dobutamine support, pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 98%. Chest examination showed no abnormalities. The ECG at the referring hospital showed a > 3 mm horizontal ST-segment depression in V1\u2013V4 , but a posterior lead ECG (V7\u2013V9) was not performed. However, the ECG in our hospital (90-minute difference from the first ECG) revealed a 0.5-mm ST-segment depression in V1\u2013V3 with an ST-segment elevation in V7\u2013V9 . Moreover, the troponin T value increased to 4068 ng/L.

    "original_case": "A 43-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department with generalized itching, hives, and postural dizziness 1 hour after taking slow-release diclofenac sodium (diclofenac sodium SR) 100 mg tablet for headache. She has a history of migraine, for which she had been taking diclofenac sodium SR. Two months prior to this episode, she had developed itching of her palms after taking a diclofenac sodium SR tablet, which had resolved spontaneously. Apart from one incident of food allergy to northern pilchard, she had no food or drug allergy. She had no history of asthma. At the onset of her symptoms, the patient had taken 4 mg of chlorpheniramine for itching and continued to do household chores. Although the itching subsided after about 15 minutes, she felt lightheaded and weak on standing, which prompted her to lie down. Her postural symptoms resolved within 5 minutes of lying down. Over the next 20 minutes, she developed a dry cough with difficulty breathing. Her chest symptoms were relieved after taking two puffs of salbutamol from a metered-dose inhaler prescribed for her daughter. Subsequently, as the itching recurred with hives, she decided to seek medical care. The patient again felt dizzy and lightheaded on getting up and therefore remained supine while traveling to the hospital. On admission to the emergency department, she was conscious and rational, with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute and supine blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 99% on room air. Examination revealed skin erythema, cutaneous edema, mild urticaria, and scattered rhonchi in both lungs. The rest of the system examination was normal. She was given intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg and chlorpheniramine 10 mg. Her vital parameters were monitored continuously. Intramuscular (IM) adrenaline and intravenous fluid were withheld because of high blood pressure. As the patient was tachycardic, nebulized adrenaline or salbutamol was not given. Her cutaneous and respiratory symptoms improved with treatment, but pulse rate and blood pressure remained persistently high. Forty minutes later, she felt the need to pass urine and was advised to use a bedpan. However, as the patient insisted on using the washroom, she was asked to sit up on the bed without standing immediately. Her dizziness and lightheadedness recurred within minutes of sitting up, and a dramatic drop in her blood pressure from 198/100 mmHg to 80/60 mmHg was observed. She was put back in the supine position, and her legs were elevated. Intramuscular adrenaline 0.5 mg was administered immediately, and a fluid bolus was given. As the blood pressure remained low (80/62 mmHg), IM adrenaline was repeated twice, 5 minutes apart, until the systolic blood pressure was more than 100 mmHg. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further observation. Her postural symptoms resolved completely after the administration of adrenaline. Her blood pressure fluctuated over the ensuing 24 hours with frequent high readings, and she remained tachycardic. Noteworthily, her blood pressure readings after treatment with adrenaline were not as high as the blood pressure at presentation. There were no hypotensive episodes. All her basic laboratory investigations, including full blood count (FBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and renal function tests were normal. Serum tryptase was not done as the clinical criteria for the diagnosis were met. Two days later, when she was discharged from the hospital, her blood pressure was 165/95 mmHg. On discharge, a diagnosis was made with a probable diagnosis of essential hypertension. She was prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector for emergency use and advised not to take diclofenac sodium or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Upon reviewing 2 weeks later, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed that she had previously undiagnosed hypertension. Interestingly, the highest recorded pretreatment systolic blood pressure (BP) was 170 mmHg, which was lower than her blood pressure on admission. All relevant imaging and hormonal investigations to identify a secondary cause for hypertension were found to be normal. She was commenced on telmisartan 40 mg and amlodipine 2.5 mg in the night and showed a good response to treatment. The timeline of events is summarized in Fig. 1. The cardiovascular observations within the first 6 hours of the hospital admission are depicted in Fig. 2.",

She was previously diagnosed with mild COVID-19 (flu-like symptoms, including anosmia) and underwent self-isolation. However, 3 weeks later, she started experiencing pain in her lower extremities (hyperalgesia), followed by tingling sensation and gradual weakness in all four limbs. Within a few days, she was also unable to urinate and defecate. Her spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed T2 hyperintensities along the cervicothoracic region , suggestive of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). The patient had no significant prior medical history. \n\nFig. 1 A Spine MRI scan before the first admission, showing T2 hyperintensity along the cervicothoracic region, corresponding with LETM; B brain MRI result during the first admission, revealing hyperintensity in T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in the posterior horn of the lateral ventricles; C repeat brain MRI scan obtained during the second admission, exhibiting no new lesion Full size image One day after her naso-oropharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for SARS CoV-2 was negative, the patient was transferred to our hospital. Upon neurological examination, it was found that she had tetraparesis, with more severe weaknesses in her lower extremities, hyperreflexia, and positive Babinski\u2019s signs for both legs. She also had hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and proprioceptive disturbance below Thoracal 4 (Th4) level, as well as urinary and fecal retention. Blood evaluation revealed an elevated D-dimer level (4660 \u00b5g/L), with normal C-reactive protein and procalcitonin concentrations. Anti-aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (IgG) was not detected in her serum. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (70 leukocytes/\u03bcl) and normal protein level. SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi, and other viruses were not detected by CSF PCR tests, while Gram and acid-fast bacillus stains also yielded negative results. Brain MRI showed paraventricular hyperintensity on T2 and FLAIR . \n\nThe patient received high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g/day) for 5 days, which was tapered off afterwards. Her motor strength improved remarkably, enabling her to stand up. However, her sensory and autonomic disturbances persisted. After 12 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged to continue treatment in the outpatient clinic. Two days later, the patient was readmitted to our hospital with complaints of persistent high fever (> 38 \u00b0C), nausea, and worsening of her lower limb strength . Blood tests revealed normal levels of leukocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. Meanwhile, routine urinalysis showed the presence of bacteria and nitrites, with positive urine culture for Enterobacter sp. (> 10^5 colony-forming units/mL). The patient was thus diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and treated with intravenous fosfomycin on the basis of bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. \n\nFig. 2 Timeline of clinical course Full size image Nevertheless, her fever persisted even after 3 days of treatment with combinations of intravenous antipyretics and the use of a surface cooling device. On day 3, she tended to be in a somnolent state; we suspected the fever was not only due to the UTI, but might have a central nervous system (CNS)-underlying etiology. The patient was given 250 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone, and her consciousness improved. We performed a second brain MRI scan and found no notable changes compared with the first one . The following day, the patient was once again somnolent, accompanied by tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever, and was transferred to the intensive care unit. We escalated the methylprednisolone dose to 500 mg/day, and the patient quickly regained consciousness. \n\nBetween day 7 and day 14, the patient\u2019s consciousness fluctuated considerably, from obtundation to a fully alert state; she even experienced disorientation and hallucinations (visual and auditory), along with intractable fever. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed slowing background within theta frequency and intermittently high amplitude of rhythmic delta\u2013theta wave at the bilateral frontotemporal lobe. Another lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF analysis revealed mild pleocytosis (12 cells/\u00b5L) and a positive result for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (28 U/ml) with serum titer 250 U/ml.

He had no odynophagia, dyspnea, fever, rash, constitutional symptoms, or other neurological symptoms. His medical history included only an episode of pneumonia 5 years earlier, and he took no regular medications. He worked as a butcher, was a smoker with a history of 50 pack-years, and did not consume alcohol. There were no significant occupational or environmental exposures. He was born in China and migrated to Australia in his mid-30s. There was no family history of neurological diseases. He had received the scheduled age-appropriate vaccinations in China, not including the chickenpox or varicella vaccines. On examination on his presentation, he was afebrile and the rest of his observations were within normal limits (blood pressure 160/80 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 100% on room air). His speech was normal, and voice was not hoarse. Cranial nerves were intact, there was preserved motor and sensory function in all limbs, and he was normoreflexic throughout. Cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. His throat was not inflamed, with no obvious masses, goiter, or neck lymphadenopathy. He was able to swallow a small amount of water on sip testing, but appeared to have to force-swallow, and choked when trying to sip a larger amount. A neurological examination 3 days later showed an absent right gag reflex, leftward uvula deviation, and absence of elevation of right side of palate with phonation (Additional file 1: Video S1). Laboratory results revealed a lymphocyte count of 0.8 \u00d7 10^9/L, and the rest of his complete blood count, inflammatory markers, electrolytes, and liver and renal functions were normal. Urinalysis was unremarkable, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis serologies were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain and cerebral angiogram were normal, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a nonspecific oval isointense T1 signal near the right petrous apex measuring 4 \u00d7 7 mm , with no associated T2 signal change or gadolinium enhancement identified.

    "rewritten_case": "A 64-year-old man of Chinese descent presented with a 3-day history of progressive and severe dysphagia, to both solids and liquids, associated with mild dysphonia and right-sided posterior shoulder pain. He had no odynophagia, dyspnea, fever, rash, constitutional symptoms, or other neurological symptoms. His medical history included only an episode of pneumonia 5 years earlier, and he took no regular medications. He worked as a butcher, was a smoker with a history of 50 pack-years, and did not consume alcohol. There were no significant occupational or environmental exposures. He was born in China and migrated to Australia in his mid-30s. There was no family history of neurological diseases. He had received the scheduled age-appropriate vaccinations in China, not including the chickenpox or varicella vaccines. On examination on his presentation, he was afebrile and the rest of his observations were within normal limits (blood pressure 160/80 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 100% on room air). His speech was normal, and voice was not hoarse. Cranial nerves were intact, there was preserved motor and sensory function in all limbs, and he was normoreflexic throughout. Cardiorespiratory examination was unremarkable. His throat was not inflamed, with no obvious masses, goiter, or neck lymphadenopathy. He was able to swallow a small amount of water on sip testing, but appeared to have to force-swallow, and choked when trying to sip a larger amount. A neurological examination 3 days later showed an absent right gag reflex, leftward uvula deviation, and absence of elevation of right side of palate with phonation (Additional file 1: Video S1).

The initial symptoms appeared 3 weeks prior to admission, consisting of fatigue, occasional headache, and loss of appetite. Meanwhile, 1 week before hospitalization, fever appeared up to 40 \u00b0C, recurring every 4\u20136 hours. He had previously been treated for a nasopharyngeal inflammation with antipyretics and antibiotics. However, the fever continued, and the illness progressed with vomiting and abdominal pain, fatigue, and refusal to eat. The day before admission at the intensive care unit, his family became concerned by a new onset of bilateral eye redness, swelling, redness of hands and feet, rash, irritability, and photophobia. At admission, he had fever of up to 40 \u00b0C, arterial hypotension with blood pressure (BP) of 70/40 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate (HR) of 130/min, tachypnea with a respiratory rate (RR) of 45/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%, paleness, and dehydration, with a chest capillary refill time (CRT) of 5 seconds. Signs of hyperinflammatory syndrome were also present, with mucocutaneous inflammation signs such as swollen and red eyelids, bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, oral mucosal lesions, dry lips, strawberry-red tongue, and oropharyngeal hyperemia. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Redness and swelling were also present on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (Figs. 1 and 2).\n\nFig. 1\nPalmar erythema on the first day of hospitalization\nFull size image\nFig. 2\nRedness and swelling from the upper surface to the sole of the foot\nFull size image\nThe child\u2019s mental status and level of consciousness were also altered. He was lethargic and irritable, with photophobia during the examination. His lungs were clear and had no murmurs or cardiac friction rub. The abdomen was soft without hepatosplenomegaly, but was painful during palpation. Based on a height of 120 cm and a weight of 34 kg, he had obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 23.6, placing his BMI for age at greater than the 99th percentile. There was a history of positive COVID-19 contact 3 weeks ago when his uncle had a brief febrile upper respiratory infection and was tested and confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Meanwhile, his asymptomatic father had a negative PCR test for SARS COV-2 but positive serology with a high immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to SARS COV-2 on the day of the child\u2019s admission. The child remained at home with his immediate family during this period but was not tested for SARS COV-2 infection. There was no personal or family history of allergic reactions, vasculitis, autoimmune disorders, cardiac disease, diabetes, or hereditary disease. This was the third hospitalization of the child; the first one at the age of 2 due to gastroenteritis; and the second one, at the age of 4, due to a urinary tract infection. Initial laboratory results revealed a high level of inflammatory markers, including a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 156.8 mg/l, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 100 mm/hour, procalcitonin (PCT) of 13.84 (), leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and lymphopenia (). Liver and renal functions were also altered, manifested by hypoalbuminemia (30.6 g/L), hypoproteinemia (60.3 g/L), hyperuricemia (602.77 umol/L), uremia (15.81 mmol/L), and an increased level of serum creatinine (114 umol/L) as a consequence of renal dysfunction (acute kidney injury), which resolved with hydration (). There was a mild elevation of cholesterol and significant elevation of triglycerides (5.29 mmol/L) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT, 79 U/L) with normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK) levels (). The capillary blood electrolytes (Na, K, Ca) were also altered, with hyponatremia (129 mmol/L), a low level of bicarbonates (19.7 mmol/L), a base excess (BE) of 4 mmol/L, and hypoxemia with capillary blood gas of pO2 of 63 mmHg and pCO2 of 29 mmHg (). A lumbar puncture was performed owing to fever, irritability, altered level of consciousness, and photophobia. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was slightly turbid, with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 128/mm3 (80% mononuclear cells and 20% polymorphonuclear), CSF protein of 1.14 g/L (normal range 0.10\u20130.45 g/L) and CSF glucose of 3.84 mmol/L (simultaneous blood glucose level of 5.45 mmol/L). The bacterial culture of CSF was negative. The findings from the CSF examination were consistent with aseptic meningitis. Normal fundus findings were found on ophthalmoscopy examination. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was negative, while SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing was positive. D-dimer was high, at 464 ng/mL and 833 ng/ml by two measurements (reference range \u02c2 200), while the coagulation tests were within the normal range (). The urinalysis revealed proteinuria (30\u2013100 mg/dl), which was confirmed by 24-hour urine collection. Leukocyturia and occasionally bacteriuria were also present, but the urine culture was negative. Moreover, no other obvious microbial cause of inflammation was found, including two blood cultures for bacterial sepsis, three urine cultures, and nasopharyngeal and CSF cultures. \n\n Laboratory values and trends during hospital stay\nFull size table\n Complete blood cells count (CBC) and trends during hospital stay\nFull size table\n Capillary blood gases and electrolytes\nFull size table\nThe chest radiography showed bilateral minimal peripheral patchy opacities but no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax .\n\nFig. 3\nFrontal chest radiography shows bilateral minimal peripheral patchy opacities.

Furthermore, echocardiography and abdominal ultrasonography examinations were normal at admission as well as during the follow-up examination. At the moment of admission, the child was put on oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula with an O2 flow of 2\u20133 L/min. Owing to hypotension and dehydration, rehydration with intravenous fluids, fresh plasma, and packed red blood cells was administered. Treatment also involved antibiotics, including ceftriaxone (80 mg/kg/day) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day), methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)(1 g/kg), as well as anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin.",

The child also suffered from frequent vomiting of both solid and liquid meals, and she exhibited symptoms of asthma. Interestingly, the mother mentioned that a cousin of the child had presented with similar symptoms. \n\nUpon physical examination, the girl appeared fatigued and presented hyperpigmentation on her lips, nose, and under her right eye. She was notably underweight and short for her age (25.5 kg and 133 cm, respectively), indicating possible growth failure. She experienced dyspnea, with a respiratory rate of 40-45 breaths per minute, and displayed substernal intercostal retractions. Hyperpigmentation was also observed on her genitals, and she displayed digital clubbing and hyperkeratosis on her palms and soles. Her neurological examination yielded normal results, and her psychomotor development was also within the normal range. \n\nBlood tests revealed a sodium level of 136 mmol/l, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dl, and urea level of 21 mg/dl.

The child had no known exposure to any COVID-19 patient, and all family members were symptom-free. Upon physical examination, despite not having a fever, the infant appeared dehydrated, lethargic, and in pain, particularly in the left lower limb which was noticeably swollen. The child was tachypneic and hypoxemic, with an oxygen saturation level recorded at 93.5%. His body temperature was 36.5 \u00b0C, heart rate at 140 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 52 breaths per minute. Laboratory investigations showed anemia (hemoglobin 7.9 mg/dL, hematocrit 22.5%), an elevated leukocyte count (42,110/mm3 with 82% polymorphonuclear), and a high platelet count (899,000). The levels of inflammatory markers and d-dimer were also high (CRP of 27.1 and 5200 ng/mL respectively). Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed 46.2% HbA1, 2.5% HbBA2, 19.9% HbF, and 38.4% HbS. A Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb revealed a recent total femoropopliteal venous thrombosis, the head of which was located at the level of the external iliac vein, along with subcutaneous edema and dermal thickening related to venous obstruction.

Four days into hospitalization, the child's condition remained the same: he appeared irritable and the left lower limb remained painful. The child's CRP levels had risen to 40.9 mg/L. A follow-up chest radiograph showed a slight enlargement in the cardiac area suggestive of pericardial effusion. Unfortunately, chest tomography was not possible. Despite two negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2, serology tests revealed positive IgM and negative IgG, indicating COVID-19 seroconversion. \n\nThe child's white blood cell count dropped to 20,730 leukocytes/mL, but his CRP levels rose to 138 mg/dL. An initial INR of 1.4 and anti-streptokinase antibodies of 91 UI/mL were found. Follow-up Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower limb showed a partially regressive crural deep vein thrombosis. \n\nOn the tenth day of hospitalization, the child became hemodynamically unstable and started to exhibit classical signs of acute pericarditis including chest pain, pericardial friction rub, and ECG changes with diffuse ST elevation. An urgent echocardiogram was performed which revealed significant pericardial effusion. A pericardiocentesis procedure was undertaken, yielding approximately 100 mL of serofibrinous exudation fluid.

One was 5.5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2.5 cm with attached soft tissue of 5.5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 cm, and the other one was 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cm with attached soft tissue of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 cm. Microscopic examination showed paucicellular tissue with thick densely eosinophilic elastin bands, which were positive with Verhoeff elastin stain.\n\nIn the second instance, a 49-year-old Asian female patient with a history of hypothyroidism sought medical attention due to a bulging right shoulder and episodes of right shoulder pain, which intensified during shoulder movements. Physical examination revealed a rubbery and mobile right-sided subscapular mass. Despite the pain, no movement restriction was observed during the examination. The CT scan findings were similar to the previous case. Following the same surgical procedure as the previous case, a gray, rubbery mass with irregular borders measuring 9 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3.5 cm was excised. The cut sections showed white-yellowish solid areas. Microscopic examination showed a low-cellular tumor with some thick elastin fibers, which were positive with Verhoeff elastin stain. No atypia was present.",

    "original_case": "With a clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition, a 7-year-old, Turkish male was referred to the Department of Oncology at Hacettepe University for the recurring tumor after local excision of the lesion over his nose. The lesion was a rapidly growing lesion, this time measuring 8 \u00d7 4 cm in size . Physical examination revealed that he also had hemorrhagic crusted plaques and nodules over both eyelids and upper lip, as well as multiple hypo- and hyperpigmented punctate lesions all over his body. Fig. 1 Clinical photograph showing a rapidly growing lesion on dorsum of nose and pigmented macules on sun-exposed regions of the body Full size image Perinatal and early postnatal histories were unremarkable. He had no symptoms before 2 years of age when hyperpigmented spots were first recognized. The parents were first cousins. There was no history of other family members having a similar disorder. There was no known disease in his two siblings, either. The child was regularly immunized. The developmental milestones were normal. Systemic examination, including neurological functions, was essentially normal. Starting at the age of 2 years, the patient had hyperpigmented spots all over his face and arms, more prominent on his forearm, and bilateral widespread hypopigmented areas over the thighs. This abnormal pigmentation progressively worsened on exposure to sunlight, particularly in overexposed areas. With these complaints, the patient received a clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition. When he was 2 years old, a crusted erythematous lesion appeared on the edge of his left eye, as well. Following facial lesion excision, the pathology result was found to be consistent with a tumor. After a year, lesions on one side of his nose and two other parts of his face also were excised and reported again as consistent with a tumor (4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 cm in nasal region, 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 cm in left zygomatic, 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 satellite lesion in maxilla). At the age of 6 years, the patient was admitted to our hospital for a rapidly growing nasal lesion (Figs. 2 and 3). Incisional biopsy was done from the lobulated giant mass that caused narrowing of the right nasal aperture with external pressure. Pathological examination revealed the tumor as being medium to well differentiated. The right submandibular and preauricular metastatic lymph nodes (LN) were noted during the postoperative period. Chemotherapy was started with reduced doses with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil owing to metastatic LN and unresectable primary tumor. Surgical excision could be performed after six cycles of chemotherapy, and the large mass of 9.5 cm in longest diameter was excised from the nose with positive surgical margin. After two more cycles, progressive disease was noted with enlarged submandibular LN and a new lesion on the right eyelid causing blurred vision. Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment was planned with concomitant radiotherapy (66 Gy to the primary nasal mass, 60 Gy to preauricular LN, and 54 Gy to bilateral neck). He received the antibody every 3 weeks for 4 months, and his vision was improved. However, after 4 months, the treatment had to be stopped owing to financial reasons. Control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed improvement in LN, and no new skin lesion was detected. He was followed up without any systemic chemotherapy, but local fluorouracil cream was used for new superficial lesions that appeared on the scalp, tongue, and right auricle.

Invasion of the mass into the nasal passage or ethmoid cells was not detected Full size image After 18 months of follow-up, relapse was observed on a new lesion on his nape. The excised lesion was diagnosed as recurrent tumor. The antibody was planned, but owing to refusal of financial approval of the antibody, another treatment was given for 5 months. Partial response was noted in periorbital lesions, but auricular lesions were stable. The antibody was approved and was given for 15 months. No new lesions or active complaints have been observed in the current situation, and complete remission has been achieved. Owing to the condition\u2019s genetic heterogeneity, WES was performed with Ion Proton next-generation sequencing platform, and the c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation of the gene was detected in the homozygous state. The variant was then validated by Sanger sequencing . This gene was associated with the genetic condition. This homozygous c.2250 + 1G>A splice site mutation is a mutation not yet reported in the ClinVar database. The parents of the patient were carriers (heterozygous) for the relevant mutation. The novel variant identified in this study has been submitted to ClinVar with the submission ID of SUB11135062. Fig. 4 Sanger sequencing results in the proband\u2019s family.

    "original_case": "The patient was a Japanese male in his 40s who had previously suffered renal cell carcinoma and undergone left nephrectomy. Smoking and family histories were both negative. He lived alone in a house surrounded by hills. He used the train for transportation, including taking the train station stairs to the second floor to buy the tickets. He was a private driver of a company car. On T + 3 days [T: day patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C)] in 2020, an employee at workplace was diagnosed with an infectious disease, and this was the occasion when our patient came in contact with an infected person. Present medical history The patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C) on day T in 2020, followed by development of dyspnea on day T + 4; on day T + 6, he decided to visit the emergency room of our hospital where he was checked but sent home the same day after receiving a PCR test. On day T + 8, he returned to the same hospital with worsening dyspnea and general malaise. Blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 3500/\u03bcL; lactose, dehydrogenase (LDH) 646 U/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 6.32 mg/dL; ferritin, 2291 ng/mL, and a positive PCR test for the infectious disease. He was admitted to our hospital. Plain chest X-ray on the same day showed extensive frost shadows in the upper and lower lung fields with bilateral peripheral predominance. Chest CT confirmed these findings, showing a broad range of ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening and bilateral peripheral dorsal base predominance . Respiratory function deteriorated rapidly after admission, with the patient requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation on day T + 9. He was transferred to another hospital after considering the potential need for ECMO. On day T + 13, he developed aspiration pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, with further worsening of ventilatory dysfunction, that progressed to bilateral dorsal atelectasis on day T + 14, leading to the initiation of ECMO. He was kept in prone position during the treatment. Following gradual improvement, ECMO was discontinued on day T + 22 as was mechanical ventilation 2 days later. At the last evaluation of the effects of rehabilitation therapy on day T + 29 during the previous hospitalization, the muscle strength was 2 for shoulder abduction, 3 for elbow flexion, 3 for wrist dorsiflexion, 2 for hip flexion, 3 for knee extension, and 3 for ankle dorsiflexion, based on manual muscle testing (MMT). Due to low levels of activities of daily living (ADL), he was transferred back to our hospital on day T + 30 for rehabilitation therapy. Fig. 1 A Plain radiograph of the chest (day T + 8). Note the extensive frost shadows in the upper and lower lung fields with bilateral peripheral predominance. B Computed tomography image of the chest (day T + 8). Note the broad range of ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening and bilateral peripheral dorsal base predominance. T Day patient became febrile (38 \u00b0C). Figure is taken from Kashiwabara et al. [5], with permission Full size image On first admission to our Rehabilitation Department he was given a clinical examination and underwent laboratory tests. These showed a height of 171 cm and body weight of 62 kg; full consciousness; no edema; body temperature, 36.8 \u00b0C; heart rate, 86 beats per minute; blood pressure, 114/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 19 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation (SpO2, 97% (on room air). Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.416, partial pressure CO2 (pCO2) 30.2 mmHg, and partial pressure O2 (pO2) 77.7 mmHg. Further tests included those for total protein (6.8 g/dL), albumin (2.9 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 26 mg/dL), creatinine (Cr; 1.32 mg/dL), creatinine clearance (CrCl; 59 mL/minute) (urine analysis at any time), and urine protein (\u00b1). Chest CT showed resolution of the shadows in the lower lobes bilaterally, with a band of infiltrating shadows remaining at the periphery of the upper lobes bilaterally . MMT showed hip flexion 3/3, knee extension 4/4, knee joint flexion 3/3, foot dorsiflexion 4/4, ankle plantar flexion 4/4, with no muscle weakness in both upper extremities. However, he complained of weakness, such as his cell phone feeling heavy. Cognitive function was normal, and there were no evident clinical abnormalities of the central nervous system, including olfactory or gustatory disturbances, and no neurological abnormalities other than lower limb muscle weakness. While supported, he was able to perform independently basic and orthostatic movements. He experienced a temporary decrease in SpO2 to 94% (room air) during the execution of orthostatic movements. The patient could stand for about 1 minute, although he required upper limb support during the task and was unable to hold the position for a long time (about 10 minutes). He used a walker and was able to walk independently for about 10 meters. He was frustrated and worried about social distancing and restriction of movement introduced during the pandemic. He also complained of compromised motivation during the inactivity. Fig. 2 Computed tomography image of the chest. A Day T + 30. Note the resolution of the shadows in the bilateral lower lobes, with a band of infiltrating shadows remaining at the periphery of the bilateral upper lobes. B Day T + 78. Note the resolution of the band of infiltrating shadows. Figure is taken from Kashiwabara et al. [5], with permission Full size image Clinical progress and rehabilitation therapy While the SpO2 on room air was within the normal range, the patient complained of marked muscle weakness, mainly in the lower part of the body, together with generalized weakness. Based on the medical history and the generalized and symmetrical muscle weakness reported during the previous hospitalization (provisionally diagnosed at that admission as ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) [6]), we first ruled out conditions associated with muscle weakness. Physical therapy was recommended based on the marked muscle weakness, but could not be provided in line with the hospital policy of withholding such therapy from infected patients until 2 weeks after a negative PCR test. During the 2-week quarantine period, no equipment (diagnostic or rehabilitation therapy) was taken into his hospital room. Instead, he was instructed during this 2-week period to exercise while in isolation, following a self-training program that focused on strengthening the muscles of the trunk, both upper and lower limbs, fingers, and expiratory muscles, including, among other exercises, stretching the trunk, exercising the shoulder girdle and neck, and deep breathing. The patient adhered to the program, which was designed to achieve independence in basic movements and gait, as well as to strengthen respiratory muscles. The self-exercise program included exercising three times a day, at 1000, 1300, and 1500 hours, for a total of about 30 minutes, three sets at a time, 6 days a week. The patient was not supervised during this exercise-in-isolation program, but was occasionally monitored by nurses or physical therapists. There was no drop in SpO2 during the exercising. However, the patient was not monitored with video cameras or remote recording while he remained in isolation. The exercise intensity was increased by the physical therapist after the sixth day. Following this program, the patient was able to walk unassisted by day T + 34 without a walker. On day T + 37, he was transferred to the general ward and provided with a new self-training program. The aim of this protocol was to improve walking endurance by strengthening trunk and lower limb muscles, such as standing up, standing on one leg, standing on the toes, and squatting. Although he spent most of the time in the hospital room, the patient was gradually introduced to light exercises, such as walking outside the room and inside the hospital. Despite his low endurance, he was able to stand without upper limb support and also on one leg for 10 seconds bilaterally. The measured walking distance while wearing a face mask was 383 m (). By day T + 39, his body weight had increased to 66.5 kg and spirometry values became normal (). He was able to do four to five squats by day T + 41, but still had difficulty climbing stairs. When 2 weeks had passed since the negative PCR test, according to the hospital rules at that time the patient was allowed to receive individual therapy (respiratory rehabilitation/physical therapy). In compliance with the standard rules, the patient wore a surgical mask and the therapist wore personal protective equipment. On day T + 49, we started the following individualized rehabilitation therapy, including physical and respiratory rehabilitation therapy, in addition to education on independent training, such as (1) range of motion joint exercises, (2) muscle strengthening exercises, (3) gait exercises, (4) stair climbing exercises, (5) endurance training, and (6) self-directed training, through supervised, non-equipment-based exercises. Endurance was still low, and he suffered from shortness of breath after light jogging for a very short distance. He was later able to go up and down the stairs independently without support, and accordingly was discharged on day T + 53. During the period between hospitalization day T + 30 and day T + 53, the patient was provided with a general diet (1900 kcal/day: 65\u201375 g protein, 44\u201361 g fat, 263\u2013311 g carbohydrate, and < 8 g salt), with protein accounting for 15-16% of total calorie intake. At the time of discharge, his body temperature was 36.5 \u00b0C; heart rate, 94 beats per minute; blood pressure, 106/70 mmHg; respiratory rate, 14 breaths per minute; SpO2, 98% (on room air).  Results of various motor and respiratory function tests at 1 and 4 months after onset of the infectious disease Full size table On the first post-discharge outpatient visit, he was instructed to continue with the voluntary training program, with a subjective aerobic exercise intensity of \u201ceasy,\u201d resistance exercise intensity of 8\u201312 RM (Repetition Maximum), and with no restrictions on exercise type. He was also instructed to gradually increase the load with the recovery of physical strength. Based on his good general condition and renal function, the patient was encouraged to increase the intensity of exercise and consume a protein-rich diet after discharge, including natto (fermented soybeans) and chicken meat. A chest CT taken on day T + 78 showed resolution of the band of infiltrating shadows . Laboratory tests at this same time point showed total protein of 6.7 g/dL, albumin of 4.0 g/dL, BUN of 18 mg/dL, Cr of 1.36 mg/dL, CrCl of 61 mL/minute, and \u00b1 proteinuria. He returned to work on day T + 88 and continued to show improvement in physical fitness, with a body weight gain to 72 kg (75 kg before the infectious disease). However, hair loss was noted after day T + 100 , together with a transverse nail groove.  shows the changes in various parameters recorded at 1 and 4 months after the onset of the infectious disease (day T). Improvements were noted in respiratory function tests, the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and 6-minute walking test [7], with a decrease in the ECW/TBW ratio from 0.394 (day T + 52) to 0.389 (day T + 120), as measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis using the In Body\u00ae (InBody Japan Co., Tokyo, Japan) body composition analyzer, suggesting an increase in the number of somatic cells that make up muscles. In fact, the volume of the psoas muscle, as measured by CT, increased from 276 cm3 (day T + 41) to 316 cm3 (day T + 116) (Fig. 4 A, B). Respiratory and motor functions recovered with no complications.

He worked as a private driver for a company. \n\nOn T + 3 days (T being the day the patient developed a fever of 38 \u00b0C), a colleague at his workplace was diagnosed with an infectious disease. The patient had contact with this infected individual. On day T + 4, he developed dyspnea and by day T + 6, his symptoms worsened, prompting him to visit the emergency room. The hospital conducted a PCR test and sent him home the same day. \n\nTwo days later, the patient returned to the hospital with worsening symptoms. Blood tests revealed a leukocyte count of 3500/\u03bcL, LDH 646 U/L, CRP 6.32 mg/dL, and ferritin 2291 ng/mL. The PCR test results were positive for the infectious disease. His chest X-ray showed extensive frost shadows in the upper and lower lung fields, predominantly on the periphery. \n\nThe patient's respiratory function rapidly deteriorated after admission, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. He was transferred to another hospital considering the potential need for ECMO. He developed aspiration pneumonia on day T + 13, leading to the initiation of ECMO. \n\nThe patient showed a gradual improvement and was taken off ECMO and mechanical ventilation by day T + 22. His overall muscle strength was low, particularly in the lower body, and he was transferred back to the rehabilitation department of our hospital. \n\nDespite the improvement, the patient complained of generalized weakness. His cognitive function was assessed as normal, and there were no evident clinical abnormalities of the central nervous system. However, he was only able to stand for about 1 minute and walk independently for about 10 meters. The patient also expressed frustration and worry about the social restrictions implemented due to the pandemic. \n\nInterestingly, an observed symptom was a rash that had spread across his body, following a centrifugal distribution pattern. This rash was characterized by macules which progressed into papules and then vesicles. The characteristic umbilication, a hallmark of smallpox, was also noted. This, combined with the infectious disease in his workplace, led to a suspicion of smallpox. \n\nHowever, over the course of his hospital stay, the patient continued to improve. By day T + 49, he began to participate in an individualized rehabilitation program. His endurance gradually increased, and he was able to go up and down the stairs independently.

He returned to work on day T + 88 and continued to show improvement in physical fitness. However, hair loss was noted after day T + 100 , together with a transverse nail groove. \n\nAlthough the characteristic rash and the pattern suggested a smallpox infection, it should be noted that the patient had been in contact with a confirmed case of an infectious disease at his workplace. This, coupled with the fact that smallpox has been eradicated worldwide, makes the smallpox diagnosis less plausible, despite the symptom overlap.",

Microbiological testing of the middle ear fluid did not identify any pathogenic organisms.\n\nThe patient's facial nerve function improved, and the otorrhea reduced after the treatment. He was discharged after a week with middle ear tubes in place. However, upon presenting to the ER, he had not fully recovered his facial nerve function, which scored II on the HB scale. He also reported increased fluid intake, up to 9 L per day, and a weight gain of 12 kg over the previous 7 weeks. Laboratory tests revealed positive c-ANCA at 87.0 U/ml with increased anti-PR3 activity, while Anti-MPO activity was negative.\n\nAn MRI scan of the brain showed a slight widening of the pituitary stalk and an unclear inhomogeneity between the anterior and posterior pituitary (Figs. 4, 5). Despite this, clinical and laboratory assessments of anterior pituitary function did not indicate any insufficiencies in the somatotropic, gonadotropic, thyrotropic, or corticotropic axes. Prolactin levels were within the normal range. Plasma sodium concentration was 144 mmol/l, with a plasma osmolality of 300 mosm/kg. In a water deprivation test, urine osmolality increased insufficiently from 131 to 418 mosm/kg. Hypertonic saline-stimulated plasma copeptin measurement (2.63 pmol/l) confirmed the diagnosis of DI.\n\nNotably, during his ER visit, the patient also reported a month-long history of a non-itchy, mildly tender rash on the dorsum of both hands. On examination, it appeared as a ring of small, firm bumps (papules) with a clear center. A biopsy of the skin lesion was performed, revealing a granulomatous inflammation, leading to the provisional diagnosis of Granuloma annulare. The true diagnosis, however, was Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.",

Hypotonia and developmental delay of gross motor skills, expressive language, and social skills were the main concerns. At the time of referral, the child could not sit on his own, raise his head, crawl, or speak. However, he could smile. Other disturbing symptoms were frequent vomiting, failure to thrive, recurrent respiratory infections, irritability, and sleep disturbance.\n\nClinical findings\nPhysical examination revealed global neurodevelopmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, severe hypotonia, difficulty in breathing, and a slightly coarse facial appearance with an open mouth and protruding tongue.\n\nTimeline\nAt the age of 9 months, he suffered from hypotonia and delayed development of gross motor skills, expressive language, and social skills. He could not speak, sit, raise his head, or crawl. At the age of 1 year and 10 months, he was diagnosed based on the results of a genetic study. At the age of 2 years, the patient developed recurrent seizures.\n\nDiagnostic assessment\nBased on the initial manifestation, especially the coarse facial features, we initially suspected mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) or mucolipidosis; however, the results of an enzyme assay ruled MPS out.

At the time, positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffuse metastases in the liver, adrenal gland, and bones. Despite high tumor PD-L1 expression, the decision was made to initiate combination chemotherapy plus ICI rather than ICI monotherapy due to the patient\u2019s never-smoking status. The patient received two cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab. He tolerated treatment well, with no high-grade toxicities. However, repeat imaging after two cycles demonstrated concern for disease progression, with enlarging lesions in the lung, liver, adrenal gland, neck, and skull. Although clear growth was observed, it did not meet the threshold for hyperprogression, which is most commonly defined as at least a doubling of tumor growth rate. Given primary disease progression and the high burden of disease, the clinical team planned to change treatment to docetaxel plus ramucirumab. In the weeks following discontinuation of the carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab regimen, the patient reported improved symptoms and energy level, which were attributed to waning of treatment-associated toxicities. On the day prior to the planned initiation of docetaxel plus ramucirumab, repeat imaging was performed to provide a near-term baseline for subsequent efficacy assessment. The chest CT demonstrated improvement compared to the prior CT image. Accordingly, instead of changing the treatment regimen, the clinical team proceeded with two additional cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, following which further response was noted on the chest CT and PET images (Figs. 1, 2). Subsequently, maintenance therapy was initiated with pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, which was changed to pembrolizumab monotherapy after one cycle due to serum creatinine elevation and fatigue. Since then, the patient has received six cycles of maintenance pembrolizumab, and disease control remains ongoing at 6 months after the initiation of combination chemotherapy plus ICI.

Treatment with topical steroids of medium potency (mometasone furoate 0.1%) and hydrating creams was inefficient.  \nIndividual lesions tended to last for approximately 2 days before regression, but were asymptomatic. There were no bullae or erosions, nor mucosal lesions. Exposure to the sun aggravated the skin eruption.  \nThe patient did not experience musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or any other symptoms. There was no family history of autoimmune or other relevant diseases.  \nPhysical findings  \nOn clinical examination, we found multiple sharply demarcated erythematous plaques on the back, chest, abdomen, and legs, and somewhat less on the arms and hands. There were no lesions on the groin, palmoplantar, or on the scalp (Fig. 1a\u2013c).  \nFig. 1  \nPatient presenting with a skin eruption with acute onset consisting of multiple sharply demarcated erythematous plaques on the back (a), chest, abdomen (b), and legs (c), and somewhat less on the arms and hands.

In the superficial dermis, however, there was a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate consisting of neutrophils, some histiocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. There was remarkable leukocytoclasis. The vascular endothelium was mildly swollen but without any fibrinoid necrosis of the vascular walls.  \nLaboratory data  \nComplete blood count showed white blood cells of 10.80\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L with an increase in neutrophils (8.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L), but a normal red blood cell and platelet count.

Three months later, he underwent the same surgical procedure using the same retrobulbar anesthesia in his right eye. Preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.5 (\u2212 1.25 sphere \u2212 0.75 cylinder at axis 50) in the right eye and 0.75 (\u2212 3.25 sphere \u2212 1.75 cylinder at axis 95) in the left eye. Both eyes were pseudophakic at the time of macular pucker diagnosis and underwent the same procedure 3 months apart. The patient underwent surgery under monitored anesthesia care with a retrobulbar block using a 25-gauge (G), 38-mm Atkinson needle containing 5 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 2% Xylocaine containing adrenaline (1:200,000) and Bupivacaine 5 mg/ml. Both eyes were operated by the same experienced surgeon. In both cases the retrobulbar anesthesia was administered by the same experienced ophthalmologist and the same drug combination was used. \n\nPreoperative review of the patient\u2019s medical history showed that the patient was under observation due to a myocardial infarction that he had about 5 years previously. He also was under rheumatological observation for ankylosing spondylitis. His treatment at the time of surgery consisted of acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg once daily and atorvastatin 40 mg once daily. No other health problems were reported. The patient denied any allergies. The patient\u2019s social history was negative for smoking, alcohol abuse, recreational drug use, and travel abroad. The patient was a doctor who had been worked in the hospital as a clinician for about 30 years. His mother suffered from migraines and died of a heart attack at the age of 70 years. At the age of 69 years, his maternal grandfather suffered a stroke. The patient did not know anything about his father\u2019s side of the family, but there was no other family history of stroke or vascular illness. \n\nThree 25G trocars were placed through a self-sealing sclerotomy construction. Central and peripheral pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed. Preexisting posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) induction was verified. Brilliant Blue G containing dye (ILM-BLUE\u00ae; D.O.R.C., Zuidland, the Netherlands) aided visualization of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and allowed for both ERM and ILM peeling up to the vascular arcades. Peripheral indentation allowed for retinal lesion verification. No breaks were found. BSS intraocular irrigating solution was left in the vitreous chamber. The sclerotomies were self-sealing and no sutures were needed. At the conclusion of the procedure, about 0.2 mg of subconjunctival gentamycin was administered. No gas bubble was instilled, there were no episodes of hypotension during the surgery, and postoperatively the patient did not sleep in the prone position. \n\nThe left eye had a regular postoperative course . On postoperative day 1 the patient was seen by a junior ophthalmologist, and the visual acuity (VA) in the right eye was hand motion. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 14 mmHg.

    "original_case": "A 59-year-old German woman with a past medical history of hypothyroidism and cutaneous lupus erythematosus presented at the hospital\u00b4s emergency room 7 days after having been bitten by a wild Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). The patient reported having noticed a squirrel lying motionless on the ground when she took a walk. As soon as she tried to examine the animal, it started biting her, biting digit IV of the right hand and digit II of the left hand. After the wounds had been cleaned and dressed, she was started the same day on antibiotic therapy consisting of cefuroxime 500 mg orally twice a day. Tetanus vaccination status was also checked. On day 6 after the bite, the patient presented at the hospital\u2019s emergency room showing the following symptoms: general malaise, aching head and body, fever, chill, and a swollen right elbow. She did not report having suffered from nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or noise. The clinical examination showed a minor bite on digit IV of the right hand, located near the middle phalanx, slightly reddened, yet without clear inflammatory signs. There was no pain to pressure, no movement restriction, nor any sensory deficit. There were also visible signs of lymphadenitis at the ulnar side of the right elbow. The peripheral sensitivity as well as movement skills and blood flow were intact. At the index finger of the left hand, another minor bite without any local or proximal signs of inflammation was recorded. The physical examination did not reveal anything unusual. The vital parameters were stable, with the exception of a negligible sinus tachycardia. No signs of meningism were found. Laboratory tests showed an increase in the C-reactive protein (CRP) up to 28.6 mg/L (reference < 5 mg/L), but no leukocytosis. The test for procalcitonin (indicating bacterial inflammation) was negative. Sampled cerebrospinal fluid and urine were also negative in standard laboratory tests. X-rays of the thorax and of digit IV of the right hand and a native computed tomography (CT) brain scan did not show any pathological outcomes. Real-time PCR assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A and B were negative. Starting on day 7, the medical treatment also comprised combination therapy with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam, 2 g/1 g) 3 times a day. However, the patient\u2019s condition did not improve and fever rose up to 39.2 \u00b0C and persisted until day 12. Blood culture remained negative, even at 14 days after inoculation. CRP increased up to 185 mg/L on day 12. As a consequence, treatment was intensified by commencing combination antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (4 g/0.5 g) on day 11. Following initiation of therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam, the CRP fell to 74 mg/L (day 14) and there was a mild persisting leukocytosis (12.14 \u00d7 10^3). In parallel, the wound on the patient\u2019s right hand developed an ulcer-like lesion showing swollen reddened edges and a central incrustation . The lymphadenitis of the right elbow persisted. It was at this stage that a specific infectious disease was suspected as a possible diagnosis for the first time. Following a phone call with the reference laboratory for the suspected infectious disease on day 14, the decision was made to send a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient\u2019s right hand (A-1825/1) to the reference laboratory for microbiological examination. In addition, a serum sample (A-1825/2) was taken for antibody detection (day 14). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide of the suspected pathogen Igpoly, immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM were borderline. Fig. 1 Picture of the right hand of the patient at day 14 after the squirrel bite on the digit IV. After presentation of the ulcerous lesion and the local lymphadenitis of the right elbow in combination with the non-effective antibiotic treatment using three different antibiotics over 2 weeks, the suspicion of a specific infectious disease was expressed. To isolate living bacteria and extract DNA, the wound swab was suspended in 900 \u00b5L double-distilled water, and a 450-\u00b5L of the suspension was centrifuged. The resulting pellet was used for genomic desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction (DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A real-time PCR based on specific primers confirmed the presence of the suspected pathogen DNA in the wound swab sample. Subspecies was identified by block PCR targeting the region of difference 1 (RD1) according to protocols described by Broekhuijsen et al. For culture, 50 \u00b5L of the swab suspension was inoculated in 10 mL medium T and streaked onto MTKH, as well as onto chocolate agar plates and Neisseria selective medium plus (both Oxoid Germany GmbH, Wesel, Germany). The liquid medium and the agar plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Bacterial growth typical for the suspected pathogen could be observed on MTKH on day 3 of culture and on the chocolate and Neisseria agar plates on day 4. The patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid did not test positive for the suspected pathogen. Minimal inhibitory concentration testing according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI; https://clsi.org/standards/products/microbiology/documents/m100/) guidelines for the suspected pathogen demonstrated an in vitro sensitivity to all antibiotics recommended for treatment of the specific infectious disease. The patient\u2019s antibiotic treatment applied until that stage turned out to be inadequate. In a sequencing study (MiSeq sequencer [Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA], see for details) and the phylogenetic analysis (Geneious prime [Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand], Mauve alignment, followed by neighbor-joining clustering, see for details), the DNA from the strain isolated from the patient\u2019s wound swab was shown to belong to a specific biovar and clade . Fig. 2 Phylogenetic relationship of the suspected pathogen in a wound swab sample from digit IV of the patient\u2019s right hand (A-1825/1) (red, in bold) to isolates from various regions. Strains belonging to a specific major clade are indicated in blue. For each genome sequence, the year of sampling, the host organism, sampling spot (German federal states), and the known final subclade are given.

Asterisk indicates no bacterial isolate, genomic DNA only; for further details, see. The analysis was based on a Mauve alignment for colinear genomes. Genomes were generated by DNA sequencing and mapping of DNA reads to the genome of the suspected pathogen strain LVS (for details, see). For the clustering, the neighbor-joining bootstrap method was used, with the suspected pathogen strain OSU18 as an outgroup.",

The incident occurred during a walk when she noticed a seemingly lifeless squirrel on the ground. As she attempted to examine the animal, it suddenly bit her on digit IV of her right hand and digit II of her left hand. After cleaning and dressing the wounds, she began taking oral cefuroxime, a strong antibiotic, twice a day. Her tetanus vaccination status was also confirmed.\n\nSix days post-bite, she returned to the emergency room with symptoms of general malaise, body aches, headaches, fever, chills, and a swollen right elbow. Notably, she did not suffer from nausea, sensitivity to light or noise, or vomiting. Clinical examination revealed minor bites on her hands, with slight redness but no clear signs of inflammation. The lymph nodes on the ulnar side of her right elbow were visibly inflamed. Peripheral sensitivity, movement skills, and blood flow remained normal. \n\nVital parameters remained stable, barring a negligible sinus tachycardia. No signs of meningism were noted. Lab tests showed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level at 28.6 mg/L, but no leukocytosis. Tests for procalcitonin, a marker of bacterial inflammation, returned negative. Standard tests on sampled cerebrospinal fluid and urine were also negative. X-rays of the chest and right hand, along with a native CT brain scan, did not reveal any abnormalities. PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A and B were negative. \n\nFrom day 7, her medical treatment was broadened to include intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin/sulbactam). However, her condition did not improve, and her fever rose and persisted until day 12. Blood cultures remained negative 14 days post-inoculation. CRP increased to 185 mg/L on day 12, prompting a switch to piperacillin/tazobactam on day 11. \n\nDespite the change in treatment, the wound on her right hand developed an ulcer-like lesion with swollen, reddened edges and a central incrustation. The lymphadenitis in her right elbow persisted. At this stage, a possible specific infectious disease was suspected for the first time. A wound swab sample and a serum sample were sent to the reference laboratory for microbiological examination and antibody detection. \n\nThe ELISA test showed borderline levels of antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide of the pathogen Igpoly, immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM. The wound swab was processed for bacterial culture and DNA extraction. A real-time PCR confirmed the presence of the suspected pathogen DNA in the wound swab sample. \n\nDespite these findings, the patient\u2019s cerebrospinal fluid did not test positive for the suspected pathogen. However, the unusual clinical presentation, the patient\u2019s contact history with a wild animal, and a mild persisting leukocytosis prompted the consideration of an alternative diagnosis: Tularemia, a disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, which is often transmitted via animal bites. This diagnosis was also supported by the patient\u2019s response to antibiotic therapy, which would be expected for Tularemia, and the geographical location, as the disease is endemic in Germany.\n\nFurther tests, including a sequencing study and phylogenetic analysis, confirmed that the DNA from the strain isolated from the patient\u2019s wound swab belonged to a specific biovar and clade. However, the symptoms, patient history, laboratory findings, and the epidemiological context supported the diagnosis of Tularemia. The patient was thus started on a treatment regimen suitable for Tul",

Patient A was a 58-year-old Filipina woman; patient B was a 62-year-old Korean woman; and patient C was a 57-year-old Vietnamese woman. Botulinum toxin was administered to treat the blepharospasm, and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) was administered to treat the blepharoptosis. These cases were particularly very intriguing, as we observed in Patients A and B that oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) increased the effects of botulinum toxin and resulted in a greater reduction of blepharospasm. In Patient C, we observed the initial effects of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) after 4 days and reported the preliminary results. Each patient was given the option to complete a survey that assessed the efficacy of botulinum toxin alone and the efficacy of both botulinum toxin and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) in reducing blepharospasm. Furthermore, the survey asked patients about their perceived stress during the past month. According to the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire, a score of 0-13 indicates low levels of psychological stress, a score of 14-26 indicates moderate stress, and a score of 27-40 indicates high stress.\n\nPatient A\u2019s past medical history included hypertension and temporomandibular joint disorder. Her ocular history included blepharospasm, upper eyelid ptosis, upper lid dermatochalasis, and dry eye syndrome.

She had been using Xiidra ophthalmic solution (Xiidra\u00ae 5%; Novartis, Copenhagen, Denmark) in OU twice daily (bid), Lumigan (latanoprost) OU every night (qhs), and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) OU every morning (qam). Punctal silicone plugs had been inserted to treat her dry eye on 19 December 2016. Patient B had been receiving botulinum toxin treatment since 2016. The administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) to treat Patient B\u2019s condition began on 10 June 2021.\n\nPatient B\u2019s most recent follow-up examination took place on 15 July 2021. Her Va was 20/80-1 OD and 20/20-3 OS. She reported a decrease in her blepharospasm when using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). Her most recent botulinum toxin treatment was on 29 October 2021 as was her seventh botulinum treatment. Patient B continues to use oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) OU qam. According to the survey, patient B indicated that the use of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) after botulinum toxin administration was effective and resulted in little to no blepharospasm after 1 month of its use (). Patient B deferred to complete the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire. After 6 months of using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%), Patient B indicated a strong reduction in blepharospasm  during her most recent examination.\n\nFig. 3 Patient B after using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) for 6 months Full size image\n\nPatient C\u2019s past medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus. Her ocular history included blepharospasm, blepharoptosis, chalazion, dry eyes, and lagophthalmos. She had been using artificial tears and oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). She had been receiving botulinum toxin injections for blepharospasm since 2015.\n\nOn patient C\u2019s most recent follow-up on 29 July 2021 at which time her VA was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS. She had arrived for an administration of botulinum toxin to treat her blepharospasm. Patient C received her 34th botulinum toxin administration on 29 July 2021. Oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) was given to her after her examination as another treatment for blepharospasm. According to the survey, patient C indicated that oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) use after botulinum toxin administration did not result in a noticeable blepharospasm reduction after 4 days . Patient C specified that only a small reduction in blepharospasm took place after 4 days of using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%), yet she decided to continue using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) long-term to potentially experience more noticeable reductions (). She specified that both botulinum toxin treatment by itself and botulinum toxin treatment with oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) were effective with moderate spasm frequency. Patient C had a Perceived Stress Scale score of 21, indicating moderate stress, for the past month ().\n\nFig. 4 Patient C before using oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) Full size image",
    "rewritten_case": "Three distinct cases were observed where the administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) was applied as a supplementary treatment after botulinum toxin therapy for blepharospasm and blepharoptosis. The patients in our study were three women from Southeast Asia, aged in their late 50s to early 60s.\n\nIntriguingly, in two of the patients, the use of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) appeared to enhance the effects of the botulinum toxin, leading to a greater reduction in blepharospasm. In the third patient, the initial effects of the oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%) became noticeable after a few days of use.\n\nThe patients' medical histories varied. For instance, one patient had previously been treated for hypertension and temporomandibular joint disorder. Her ocular history was also quite complex, with previous diagnoses of upper eyelid ptosis, upper lid dermatochalasis, and dry eye syndrome. Another patient had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and her ocular history included blepharoptosis, chalazion, dry eyes, and lagophthalmos.\n\nAll three patients had been receiving botulinum toxin treatments before the introduction of oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). They noted a decrease in their blepharospasm after the introduction of the ophthalmic solution, with one patient even mentioning a reduction in the amount of effort needed to keep her eyes open.\n\nThe patients completed a survey to assess the efficacy of the botulinum toxin alone and in combination with the oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). They also completed the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire to evaluate their psychological stress levels. According to their scores, one patient experienced low levels of stress, while another reported moderate stress levels. The third patient chose not to complete the stress questionnaire.\n\nThese cases highlight the potential for enhanced effectiveness of botulinum toxin treatment for blepharospasm and blepharoptosis when combined with oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (0.1%). However, further research is needed to fully understand and validate these findings.",

The patient\u2019s history was unremarkable, except for mild arterial hypertension well treated with calcium channel blockers and diabetes. There were no hypertensive crises in her anamnesis. One month ago, she complained of dyspnea, fever, and chest pain. Given the presentation during the coronavirus pandemic, a computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed  in line with the diagnostic pathway for COVID-19, which incidentally showed a retroperitoneal necrotizing mass. \n\nFig. 1 Computed tomography (CT) scan in pulmonary (A) and mediastinal (B) windows revealing ground-glass opacities related to COVID-19 infection and an incidental retroperitoneal mass (white arrow). \n\nFull size image Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed  and revealed an inhomogeneous, encapsulated, partially and vividly contrast-enhancing tumor, with a diameter of 16 \u00d7 12 cm. It was located in the left retroperitoneal with a close connection to the abdominal aorta, iliopsoas muscle, and upper pole of the left kidney. Thick and tortuous arteries and veins were observed inside and at the periphery of the tumor. There were no metastases or abdominal lymphadenopathy. \n\nFig. 2.

Following removal, it was identified that the tumor exhibited a capsule that was soft and gray-red . Hemorrhage, cystic degeneration, and necrosis were observed inside the tumors. On pathologic examination, tumor cells were oval or polygonal in shape and arranged in nests or trabeculae, containing rich cytoplasm with eosinophilic fine granules. Large nuclei were strongly stained and exhibited round or oval nucleoli.

The rash started on the face, later progressing to involve the entire body except the palms and soles of the feet. The skin lesions were itchy with obvious peeling. He had significant improvement of the symptoms while using steroid creams, with flares upon cessation. He also presented with a history of recurrent purulent nasal discharge with the first episode being at 4 months of age. Four episodes were reported since the onset of symptoms, which were at least a month apart, all being treated with a course of oral antibiotics. Additionally, he had three episodes of bilateral purulent ear discharge starting at 4 months of age, which were associated with an on and off low-grade fever.

The only sibling who is alive is an 8-year-old female who is healthy with no similar symptoms. Furthermore, there is history of early pregnancy loss at 2 months of gestational age, but the sex of the abortus was not determined. His mother received adequate prenatal care. He was delivered at term via caesarean section owing to abnormal lie with birth weight (BWT) of 3.5 kg with no obvious perinatal insult.

The wound was sutured with Dacron 5-0 fiber to stop bleeding. Antibiotic and pain-relief medication were provided for 3 days. The mucosal tissue was soaked in 10% betadine in distilled water (1:8 dilution) for 10 min, then rinsed with 0.5% levofloxacin before being transported in 30 mL FDM (DMEM, 10% FBS, 0.125 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B, 100 IU/mL penicillin G, 100 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin) in a sterilized box to the tissue culture facility. The dissected tissue was exposed to 1000 PU/mL dispase to separate the mucosal epithelial layer from the subcutaneous layer. The epithelial layer was digested with 0.25% trypsin EDTA to segregate epithelial cells. The isolated epithelial cells were seeded onto the irradiated feeder cells at a density of 2\u20133 \u00d7 10\n5\ncells/35-mm dish and maintained in 2\u00a0mL KCM medium with epidermal growth factor at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO\n2\nfor 12\u201314 days before the transplant. For the colony-forming assay (CFA), the epithelial cells were seeded at 3000\u20135000 cells/60-mm dish; the mucosal epithelial sheets were then examined for quality and safety (Table\n1\n), including by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Samples were submitted for sterility tests including bacterial culture, fungal culture and endotoxin assay at the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital.\n The criteria for the safety test of the epithelial sheet\nFull size table\nTransplantation\nThe mucosal sheet was transferred in a close-system box kept at 20\u00a0\u00b0C to the operating room. The cell sheet was harvested on a ring of PVDF membrane (outer diameter: 25 mm; inner diameter: 15 mm). The transplantation of the cultivated oral mucosal epithelial sheet was performed at 20\u00b0C with the patient under general anesthesia. The first step was the excision of conjunctiva and fibrous tissue on the cornea, namely symblepharon lysis, prior to the actual transplant. Before and after surgery, the subjects received topical antibiotic every 2 hours, and topical corticosteroid 4 times daily. Intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g) was given every 12 hours for 3 days, then oral antibiotic for the next 5 days. Intravenous solumedrol (125 mg) was given every 12 hours for the first day and once daily for 2 days, and oral prednisolone (25 mg) was given twice daily for 2\u20134 weeks. The subjects wore protective contact lenses for 1 year following surgery. The symptoms, clinical findings of inflammation, and the accompanying images were recorded in a dedicated hard disk and graded for severity at the follow-up periods:  2 and 4 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months. The main outcome included corneal epithelial defect (0\u2013100%) and conjunctivalization on the cornea (25\u2013100%) within 1 year (graded from 0\u20135, with 0 = bad and 5 = excellent). The secondary outcome included visual acuity, corneal opacity, corneal vascularization, and complications. Only the investigators could access the collected data.\nStatistical analysis\nThe results are shown as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean of at least triplicate determinants.

All patients were enrolled as a single group, giving their informed consent to the investigators at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital. The study protocol could be terminated due to various reasons, including loss to follow-up, inability to procure mucosal tissue, or at the patient\u2019s request. The inclusion criteria encompassed patients over 20 years old with total LSCD or total conjunctivalization from any cause. Pregnancy, severe infection, keratitis, and eye or buccal mucosal complications were among the exclusion criteria.

    "original_case": "An Iranian (Asian) pregnant woman aged 32 years old with a primary complaint of preterm uterine contraction and vaginal bleeding presented to the obstetric ward of Yas Hospital (Tehran-Iran, January 2021). She was a multi-para woman (Gravida: 3, Para: 2, Living: 2, Abortion: 0) with a gestational age of 30 weeks. She did not report any prenatal complications and had received corticosteroid therapy 2 days prior to hospital admission. Upon presentation, magnesium sulfate was immediately administered but she was transferred to the operation room for repeat Cesarean section due to progressive cervical dilation. A preterm male newborn with a first-minute Apgar score of 7 and birth weight of 1190 g was born. Physical examination after birth showed a notable frontal bossing, acrocyanosis, and diffuse head, neck, hand, and leg ecchymosis. Anterior and posterior fontanelles were normal. No congenital anomaly or abdominal organomegaly was observed. Peripheral pulses were palpable and heart sounds were normal without any abnormal sounds. His reflexes were normal, but limb movements were hypotonic. Due to an increase in his respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) score from 4 to 7 and signs of respiratory distress (inter- and subcostal retraction, grunting, and decreased breathing sounds), resuscitation measures were initiated. He was then given nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the operation room that was subsequently switched to mechanical ventilation in the NICU. Intratracheal surfactant and intravenous antibiotic therapy were also initiated in the NICU. Under mechanical ventilation with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) setup, his O2 saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate improved to > 94%, 70/35 mmHg, and 160 beats per minute, respectively. On day 3 post-NICU admission, a PICC line (Premicath; 1Fr/28 G; VYGON, \u00c9couen, France; Code 1261.080) was also inserted from the auxiliary vein of the right upper extremity for intravenous therapy, delivery of medications, and parenteral nutrition. A chest X-ray showed that the tip of the PICC line was in the appropriate place in the superior vena cava (SVC) . Mechanical ventilation was discontinued 72 h post-NICU admission because of improved respiratory condition and normal automatic breathing. After extubation, low-flow oxygen therapy was continued and low-volume feeding was initiated based on his tolerance. His weight gain was acceptable and the clinical situation improved, including a gradual increase in the feeding volume and respiratory support. On day 10 post-NICU admission, he suddenly developed hypotonia, apnea, hypoxia, and bradycardia. He was gasping, had hypotension, and there was an absence of peripheral pulses. In the first minutes after the alarm signs, resuscitation was initiated and ventilation support provided, together with administration of inotropic drugs (1\u20133 minutes). Despite the high-frequency setup of the mechanical ventilator, the endotracheal tube was checked for displacement or obstruction due to his persistent critical condition (hypotension and shortness of breath). Pneumothorax and equipment failure were also ruled out. Several medical measures were initiated (approximately at minutes 3\u20134), including nothing by mouth (NPO), high-dose antibiotic therapy, emergency echocardiography, brain ultrasound, arterial and venous blood sampling, blood cell count, and arterial blood gas analysis. Fig. 1 Chest X-ray findings showing the tip of the peripherally inserted central catheter line at appropriate position Full size image Echocardiography was performed over the next 5\u20137 minutes , and the results showed severe pericardial effusion, right atrial collapse, ventricle dysfunction, and tamponade. The ejection fraction value was 40%, and there was no evidence of atrial septal defect (ASD), pleural effusion, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A peripheral venous catheter was inserted, and the PICC was removed at the same time. Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed through subxiphoid cannulation guided by echocardiography and 10 ml of the pericardial fluid was aspirated (over the next 7\u201315 minutes) (Electronic Supplementary Material file 1: Video S1). The aspirated fluid was sent to the laboratory for tests, with the results showing severe acidosis (pH 6.80) and hyperglycemia (). To improve the hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, the patient was hydrated with low glucose solution and bicarbonate was initiated. Respiratory support was continued and antibiotics covering Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria were administered. Brain sonography was also performed, which was normal. The workup sequence is shown in . Fig. 2 Emergency echocardiography Full size image  Results of arterial blood gas and laboratory blood tests Full size table  Sequence of performed workups following onset of alarms Full size table Under mechanical ventilation the respiratory parameters improved gradually; pericardial drainage and PICC removal occurred concurrently. O2 saturation increased to 95%, blood pressure elevated, and vital signs remained stable. Analysis of the aspirated pericardial fluid showed a hyperglycemic fluid (). A dramatic improvement in the neonate's clinical responses (after pericardial drainage and PICC removal) was suggestive of PICC displacement, pericardial perforation, and cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography was repeated (\u00d7 3) every 12 hours to ensure no further pericardial effusion was present. On day 40 after birth, the patient was still in the hospital but showed weight gain; he was in good condition without requiring respiratory support.

She was a medical intern at the same hospital in the internal medicine ward, and the episode happened at 3 a.m. at the end of her shifts, while she was sleeping in the doctors\u2019 room. Because other colleges were unaware of her previous medical history, the protocol for unconscious patients was immediately implemented. Vital signs of the patient upon arrival in the emergency room were: blood pressure = 140/70 mmHg; heart rate = 110 bpm; oxygen saturation level = 98% on the right atrial; respiratory rate = 16 and temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C. The patient\u2019s BG level was 25 mg/dl by self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) device. Since the patient was unconscious, she received an intravenous (IV) bolus of 50% dextrose. Laboratory tests were run, including thyroid, kidney and liver function tests; the results are shown in . All tests revealed no abnormalities, despite a low BG level. The insulin level was high with a low C-peptide level. \n\nUptake of the IV bolus of dextrose improved the patient's level of consciousness, but she still had focal neurological symptoms, including hemiparesis and aphasia. Fifteen minutes after the initiation of treatment with serum dextrose, she was responsive to pain and stimulation. She remained in the emergency room for monitoring, and after 1 h all neurological symptoms had disappeared, satisfying Whipple\u2019s triad of hypoglycemia. Thus, a CT scan to rule out vascular events was deferred. After regaining consciousness, the patient mentioned having T1DM since the age of 18 years and receiving regular treatment with insulin and Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH). In this setting, non-beta cell tumors are unlikely to be diagnosed. The patient also claimed experiencing HU for the previous 2 years. She also mentioned at least three episodes of severe hypoglycemic episodes weekly during the last 3 months that may have necessitated the assistance of others. These episodes mostly happened at night. \n\nThe patient claims that she was very active during her work shift and did not have time to eat adequately, but she injected insulin at the usual dose. The injection regimen of the patient consisted of multiple insulin injections day: regular insulin, 10 U before breakfast and dinner, and 6 U before lunch; NPH insulin, 25 U in the morning and 10 U at night). Her dose had been adjusted at her last visit to her endocrinologist 3 months previously, but she has had several severe hypoglycemic attacks during the last 4 weeks. The patient\u2019s lifestyle had also changed in the last 6 months, as she had begun routine gym exercise to manage her insulin needs and glycemic control. \n\nShe was examined by a neurologist in the morning for her focal neurological symptoms, and the examination revealed no deficits. Her medical history was also concerning for hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), and she was recommended to have this condition evaluated as outpatient. To avoid recurrent hypoglycemia, further laboratory tests and a follow-up evaluation with an endocrinologist were recommended, as well a switch from human insulins to analog insulins.",

Upon admission to the emergency room, her vitals were recorded: blood pressure = 140/70 mmHg; heart rate = 110 bpm; oxygen saturation level = 98% on the right atrial; respiratory rate = 16 and temperature was 36.8 \u00b0C. She also had a low BG level of 25 mg/dl as measured by a self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) device. To address her unconscious state, she was administered an intravenous (IV) bolus of 50% dextrose.\n\nThe patient's level of consciousness improved following the dextrose administration, but she presented with localized neurological symptoms, including hemiparesis and aphasia. After 15 minutes of dextrose treatment, she started responding to pain and sensory stimulation. She was observed in the emergency room and within 1 hour, all neurological symptoms had subsided, aligning with Whipple\u2019s triad of hypoglycemia. Given her improved condition, a CT scan to rule out vascular incidents was not deemed necessary. \n\nUpon regaining consciousness, the patient revealed that she had been diagnosed with T1DM at the age of 18 and had been on a regular insulin and Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH) regime. She also reported experiencing Hypoglycemic Unawareness (HU) for the past 2 years, with three severe hypoglycemic episodes occurring weekly over the last 3 months, primarily at night. \n\nShe explained that her work schedule often left her with little time to eat properly, yet she maintained her usual insulin dose. Her injections consisted of regular insulin, 10 U before breakfast and dinner, and 6 U before lunch; NPH insulin, 25 U in the morning and 10 U at night. Despite a dosage adjustment by her endocrinologist three months prior, she experienced several severe hypoglycemic episodes in the past month. In addition, she had initiated a routine gym regimen over the last six months to better manage her insulin requirements and blood glucose levels. \n\nThe patient was evaluated by a neurologist in the morning for her residual neurological symptoms, but no deficits were found. Given her medical history, there was a suspicion of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), which was recommended for further outpatient evaluation. In order to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia, additional laboratory tests were suggested, as well as a consultation with an endocrinologist and a switch from human insulins to insulin analogs. \n\nHowever, the patient's laboratory results, including thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests, indicated no abnormalities, apart from the low BG level. The high insulin level with a low C-peptide level could be misleading, creating a suspicion of insulin overdose. Nevertheless, given the patient's history of managing her T1DM and the presence of Whipple's triad, a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus with hypoglycemia without coma was considered.",

Before admission, he was able to walk with a walker. He complained of dyspnea at midnight and, therefore, visited a nearby doctor. Acute exacerbation of COPD was suspected, and he was referred to the emergency department of our institution. After admission, he was unable to walk. On the eighth day of hospitalization, he was referred to our orthopedic surgery department for hip pain and was found to have fractures of both hips.

Then, the patient was moved from the traction bed to a regular surgical bed, and left hemiarthroplasty was performed for the left femoral neck fracture in supine position. A cementless hemiarthroplasty was carried out through the direct anterior approach . Intraoperative findings showed absence of hematoma in the left hip joint, suggesting an old femoral neck fracture. The second surgical operation time was 1 hour 41 minutes. The preoperative hemoglobin level was 10.5 g/dL, postoperative hemoglobin level was 9.1 g/dL, and intraoperative bleeding was 200 mL; therefore, blood transfusion was not performed.

Her vision at presentation was 6/60 (logMAR 1.0) in the right eye and 6/6 (0.0 logMAR) in the left eye. Anterior segment examination revealed pseudophakia in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. The results of the left eye fundus examination were normal. She had a 10-year history of hypertension that was well-controlled on medication; otherwise, she had no clinically relevant family/social history. Given that the macula was involved, a decision was made to perform pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling and endolaser therapy with or without silicone oil (depending upon the finding of rhegmatogenous breaks, either pre-existing or iatrogenic, during surgery). The surgery was performed using the 23-gauge Constellation Vitrectomy System (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA). This gauge was chosen as there was a lack of stock of 25 G and 27 G sets in India at the time of surgery. Infusion was initiated at 7:00 a.m. through valved micro-cannulae. After anterior, core and peripheral vitrectomy, the epicenter of the fibrous bridge causing foveal split was identified and released using the vitreous cutter . The retina was observed by fall in place following this action. Further procedures could be avoided through proper identification of the epicenter of traction, and the use of intraocular gas/silicone oil was avoided. The eye was left with aqueous tamponade and examined the next day. The optical coherence tomography image showed that the retina had fallen back in place and it continued to re-attach over the following week. At 7 days postoperative, vision had improved to 6/12 (0.3 logMAR), and vision has been maintained over 5 years of follow-up. The postoperative B scan  at the 5-year follow-up shows stable traction.

A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus arrhythmia, electric axis deviation to the right and a roughly normal ECG . Ischemic heart disease was suspected, and the patient was admitted to our hospital. On admission, his blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, heart rate was 116 bpm and respiratory rate was 21 breaths per minute. His body height was 130 cm, body weight was 29 kg and body mass index was 17.16 kg/m\u00b2. The skin of both hands, both elbows, both knees, both ankles and the buttocks had a hemispherical yellow eminence subcutaneous nodules that ranged in size from 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 to 2.0 \u00d7 6.0 cm . The boundary was clear, texture was tough and the surface was free from swelling and ulceration. Physical examination showed normal cardiac and pulmonary auscultation. The laboratory tests showed extremely high levels of blood lipids [triglycerides (TG) 1.89 mmol/l; total cholesterol (TC) 17.98 mmol/l; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 0.83 mmol/l; LDL 14.02 mmol/l] (); N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 601 pg/ml, cardiac troponins T (cTnT) was 11.5 ng/l and C-reactive protein was 1.6 mg/l.\n\nAdditional routine tests showed normal findings for blood, urine, fecal material, liver and kidney function, electrolytes, blood glucose and blood gas tandem mass spectrometry. ECG showed multiple pathological changes, including enlarged left ventricle, aortic sinus tube junction stenosis with mild regurgitation and mild mitral valve regurgitation. Chest computed tomography (CT) angiography showed stenosis in the aortic arch , while CT of both lungs showed was normal. In view of the strong hypercholesterolemia and premature CAD, family cascade screening and genetic analyses were performed for the case and for both affected and unaffected family members, with the aim to detect the pathogenic FH mutations. Blood samples were acquired from the proband and the other seven family members, including the parents and the five older sisters. DNA sequencing of exons showed a C-to-A substitution at nucleotide 126 in exon 2, resulting in a mutation in the gene encoding the LDLR in the proband and in six other family members . A representative sequencing histogram identifying the mutation and the pedigree chart created based on the DNA sequencing results is shown in Fig. 4.\n\nBased on the patient\u2019s medical history, clinical manifestations, blood lipid levels and acute coronary symptoms, we diagnosed the patient with ACS. Based on guidance from the 2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients with Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes and the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Familial Hypercholesterolemia 2017, we initiated the following treatments: (1) aspirin 50 mg taken orally (po), once daily (qd) and clopidogrel 50 mg, po, qd, to prevent thrombosis formation; (2) rosuvastatin 10 mg po, every night (qn) and diet control, to lower blood lipid levels; (3) ezetimibe tablets 10 mg po, qd, to stabilize plaque; (4) isosorbide dinitrate 2.5 mg po, twice daily (bid), to improve myocardial ischemia. Although the patient was taking rosuvastatin 10 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg daily, the level of LDL-C remained high (14.02 mmol/l). Therefore, we initiated double filtration plasma pheresis to reduce the level of LDL-C according the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Familial Hypercholesterolemia 2017. Following this treatment, the child\u2019s LDL-C level dropped to 3.18 mmol/l. CAG showed 80\u201390% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and 99% stenosis of the middle of right coronary artery (RCA), with the culprit identified as the RCA lesion . Coronary bioresorbable stents were chosen as the best treatment considering the age of the patient. However, in our hospital, the normal diameter of the RCA of patients is 2.49\u20132.68 mm and the minimum diameter of the coronary bioresorbable stents is 2.75 mm.

    "original_case": "A 40-year-old Japanese primigravida nullipara underwent fetal ultrasound at 39 weeks and 3 days gestation that revealed a left cervical mass and polyhydramnios. This had not been noted in fetal screening during the first or second trimesters and was only identified in the third trimester. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning was performed the same day , and the mass was found to consist of a massive solid component located at the base of the tongue adjacent to the airway. Given that postnatal airway obstruction or stenosis was a concern, the patient was transferred to a high-level children\u2019s general hospital, which also included a department of obstetrics, to perform EXIT.\n\nFig. 1 Nodule formation. Two nodules measuring 41 \u00d7 44 mm and 53 \u00d7 47 mm formed a continuous mass from the base of the tongue to the left buccal region. Full size image.\n\nThe infant was delivered by a planned cesarean section, and a simple tracheostomy was conducted using EXIT. The infant was a girl born at 39 weeks and 5 days gestation, with Apgar scores of 2, 3, and 4 (1, 5, 10 minutes, respectively). After the airway had been secured using EXIT, she was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, sedated, and placed on artificial ventilation. On physical examination, her birth weight was 2870 g [\u2013 0.3 standard deviation (SD)], head circumference was 33.5 cm (+ 0.1 SD), and body length was 51 cm (+ 1.0 SD). In addition to the left cervical mass and the mass at the base of the tongue diagnosed on fetal MRI, multiple subcutaneous lesions were also noted on the limbs and trunk. Blood tests showed that lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated at 2470 IU/L, alpha fetoprotein level was 42,580 ng/mL, human chorionic gonadotropin level was 19.3 mIU/L, and vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid test results were negative.\n\nCervical and surface ultrasound scanning conducted on postnatal day 0 revealed that the left cervical mass was an internally heterogeneous solid mass measuring 40 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 49 mm, with an abundant blood flow signal. A hyperechoic region was evident and considered to represent calcification. The multiple subcutaneous lesions included some with abundant blood flow and some with little blood flow containing hypoechoic regions. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography conducted on postnatal day 5  revealed that the interior of the mass was severely necrotic. Masses were also present in the lower lobe of the right lung and the thymus and were considered to be metastases. There was no invasion of the cerebral parenchyma. A tumor biopsy was performed from a subcutaneous mass in the inner left thigh on postnatal Day 1. Hematoxylin and eosin staining  revealed a dense proliferation of undifferentiated tumor cells with round nuclei. Sites of hemorrhage and necrosis were present, and numerous mitotic figures and karyorrhexis were apparent. On immunostaining, the tumor cells were negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, CD99, desmin, myogenin, Nkx2.2, PHOX2B, tyrosine hydroxylase. Intranuclear expression of SMARCB1(INI1) was also absent .\n\nFig. 2 Contrast enhancement is evident at the margins of the mass but is lacking at its center, which was necrotic.

    "rewritten_case": "A Japanese woman, in her early forties and pregnant with her first child, was found to have a left cervical mass and polyhydramnios on a routine fetal ultrasound in the latter stages of her pregnancy. Earlier screenings had not detected these abnormalities. On the same day as the ultrasound, a fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed. The scan revealed a significant solid component of the mass located at the base of the tongue near the airway, which led to concerns about potential postnatal airway obstruction or stenosis.\n\nThe woman was subsequently transferred to a specialized children\u2019s general hospital that also had an obstetrics department. This facility was better equipped to handle potential complications, including the need to perform a procedure known as EXIT (Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment).\n\nUpon arrival, the medical team planned for a cesarean section delivery of the baby. The infant, a girl, was successfully delivered. Following delivery, the medical team conducted a simple tracheostomy using the EXIT procedure to secure the baby's airway. The newborn was then moved to the neonatal intensive care unit, sedated, and put on artificial ventilation.\n\nPhysical examination of the newborn revealed multiple subcutaneous lesions on her limbs and trunk, in addition to the left cervical mass and the mass at the base of the tongue that had been previously identified on the fetal MRI. Her birth weight was 2870 g (\u2013 0.3 standard deviation (SD)), head circumference was 33.5 cm (+ 0.1 SD), and body length was 51 cm (+ 1.0 SD).\n\nBlood tests indicated elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase at 2470 IU/L, alpha fetoprotein at 42,580 ng/mL, and human chorionic gonadotropin at 19.3 mIU/L. Tests for vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid were negative.\n\nIn the period following the birth, the medical team conducted cervical and surface ultrasound scanning. The scans revealed that the left cervical mass was an internally heterogeneous solid mass with abundant blood flow. A hyperechoic region was evident and was interpreted as representing calcification. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed that the mass was severely necrotic inside. Additional masses were found in the lower lobe of the right lung and in the thymus, which were suspected to be metastases.\n\nA biopsy was taken from a subcutaneous mass in the newborn's left thigh. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed a dense proliferation of undifferentiated tumor cells with round nuclei, sites of hemorrhage and necrosis, and numerous mitotic figures and karyorrhexis. Immunostaining revealed that the tumor cells were negative for CD3, CD20, CD45, CD99, desmin, myogenin, Nkx2.2, PHOX2B, and tyrosine hydroxylase.

Two days previously, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital for management of ethanol withdrawal and was treated with intravenous fluids but not BNZs. She removed her IV and left the hospital before being formally discharged, but the family brought her to our hospital with a report of paranoia and believing people outside her home were trying to kill her. Her last known ethanol consumption was 4 days prior, and alcohol, BNZs, and barbiturates were not detected in her serum or urine. She reported at least five \u201cheavy pours\u201d of vodka every day, and had consumed this amount for a few years. Examination was significant for tachycardia (127\u2013132 beats per minute), high blood pressure (ranging from 143 to 149/102 to 103 mmHg), and mild tenderness to palpation to bilateral upper abdominal quadrants. She was calm, fully oriented, and with organized thought process, but endorsed paranoia regarding family members being out to get her and hearing voices outside her head talking about her. A medical workup for delirium revealed normal complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel with mildly elevated transaminases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 94 U/L; alanine transaminase (ALT) 72 U/L], and a noncontrast computed tomogram of the brain with mild diffuse volume loss greater than expected for her age. These abnormalities were consistent with her drinking history and not indicative of a separate process. No substances were present in urine or serum toxicology. She was negative for coronavirus (COVID), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis panel. She expressed interest in achieving sobriety from ethanol. She was first given lorazepam 2 mg orally and started on chlordiazepoxide 25 mg twice daily because her pulse and blood pressure remained elevated. Within 2 hours of every chlordiazepoxide dose, she became acutely confused and agitated, reporting visual and auditory hallucinations and stating that there were people on the other side of the door who were coming after her. After two doses of chlordiazepoxide (total of 50 mg, which is equivalent to 2 mg lorazepam), it was discontinued and she was treated with 2 mg of intramuscular lorazepam and a subsequent dose of oral lorazepam 2 mg, which were associated with improvement of her agitation. All BNZs were subsequently held. The next day, the patient was calm, coherent, with organized thought, and no hallucinations or paranoia. She remained that way over an extended observation period of over 10 hours. She was then referred to a substance treatment program where she did not exhibit any psychosis, and did not require additional BNZ medication. Our institutional human subjects protection program allowed submission of this case presentation (IRB number 22.1081).

She left that facility prematurely, removing her IV before being officially discharged. Her family reported her displaying paranoid behavior and expressing fears that people outside her home were plotting her death.\n\nHer last known ethanol consumption was not recent, and tests of her serum and urine did not show any presence of alcohol, BNZs, or barbiturates. She admitted to daily intake of at least five \"heavy pours\" of vodka for an extended period. Clinical examination revealed rapid heart rate (127-132 beats per minute), high blood pressure (143 to 149/102 to 103 mmHg), and slight sensitivity to touch in the upper abdominal quadrants on both sides. While she was calm, fully oriented, and displayed an organized thought process, she did exhibit paranoia about her family wanting to harm her and claimed to hear voices talking about her.\n\nMedical tests for delirium showed normal complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel with mildly elevated transaminases [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 94 U/L; alanine transaminase (ALT) 72 U/L], and a noncontrast computed tomogram of the brain indicating mild diffuse volume loss more than usual for her age. These findings were in line with her history of alcohol consumption and did not suggest any other concurrent disorder. Toxicology reports for her urine and serum did not detect any substances. She tested negative for COVID, HIV, and hepatitis. She expressed a desire to abstain from ethanol.\n\nTo manage her persistently high pulse and blood pressure, she was initially given lorazepam 2 mg orally and started on chlordiazepoxide 25 mg twice daily.

    "original_case": "Patient #1  \nThe first patient is a 37-year-old Caucasian man who had been relatively healthy until he presented with severe fatigue and muscle ache that persisted for several months. He visited his primary care doctor, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed a high leukocyte count and the presence of peripheral blasts. When he was sent to an emergency room, his total white blood cell (WBC) count was recorded at 20.5 k/mm3, hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL, and the platelet count was 146 k/mm3. He underwent a bone marrow biopsy that revealed hypercellular marrow. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis was positive for del 11q23 (KMT2A), and rearrangement of 14q32 (IGH). BCR-ABL minor fusion transcript (p190) was detected in a qualitative test, but it was not detected in a quantitative test. The discrepancy was due to a very low level of BCR-ABL fusion in the specimen. Hence the mutation was unlikely a pathogenic driver. Fortunately, there was no evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.  \nHis father was a marine, and their family moved to Camp Lejeune in April 1985. The patient was 20 months old when they moved there, and they lived in Tarawa Terrace until 1992. When he grew up, he served in the Marine Corps himself from 2003 to 2008. After discharge, the patient had different jobs, but he had no known occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. The patient and his family were made aware of the water contamination problem at Camp Lejeune when they received a letter from the US Navy in 2012. He never smoked and does not drink alcohol. He developed anxiety after the diagnosis but had no other comorbidities. There is no family history of malignancy to his knowledge. He has one brother, who was in utero when the family moved to Camp Lejeune, and his brother has not been diagnosed with any cancer so far.  \nThe patient was started on the Linker regimen. Following completion of induction chemotherapy (cycle 1A), a bone marrow biopsy was normocellular, with mature tri-lineage hematopoiesis. Repeat next-generation sequencing (NGS) was negative for any genetic mutation, indicating no measurable residual disease (MRD). The patient received cycles 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B of the Linker regimen, and then underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant. He tolerated the procedure well.  \n\nPatient #2  \nThe second patient is a Caucasian male who has been diagnosed with multiple different types of cancer. He was first diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma at the age of 68 after presenting with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 4.5 ng/mL. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a 1 cm nodule in the left lobe was positive for clinical-stage T2aN0 prostate adenocarcinoma. The Gleason score was 3 + 4, and the tumor involved 10% of the biopsy specimen. He underwent brachytherapy with the implantation of iodine-125 seeds. And, at age 74, he was diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma. A large ascending colon mass was found on a computed tomography (CT) scan during a workup for unexplained anemia. Subsequently, he underwent a right hemicolectomy for a high-grade, poorly differentiated pT4bN0 tumor. After surgery, he received adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy and has remained colon cancer-free per radiographic imaging and endoscopic surveillance. He was also diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 75. A series of CT scans detected a slowly but progressively enlarging mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. When it was brought up as a worrisome finding, the size of the tumor was 10 \u00d7 13 mm. He declined to undergo biopsy due to the high risks of the procedure, opting instead for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. This study confirmed the presence of the right upper lobe pulmonary nodule with a measured standardized uptake value (SUV) of 8.8. After an interdisciplinary discussion, the consensus decision was to obliterate the mass with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The patient received a protracted course of 12 fractions of radiation at \u00d7400 cGy per dose, and there has been no evidence of recurrent disease since then.  \nAt the age of 78, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He had intermittent thrombocytopenia for several years, but workup for the lymphoproliferative disease was negative. However, a recent bone marrow biopsy was positive for kappa monotypic B cells, consistent with CLL. Then, the patient developed Evans syndrome with progressive thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. He was initially treated with rituximab plus prednisone. However, without improvement in the cell counts, the treatment was subsequently switched to a single-agent ibrutinib. After the switch of therapy, his blood counts have stabilized.  \nThis patient was stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1962 to 1987 as an enlisted marine. He lived in a trailer park in Camp Johnson, formerly named Camp Knox. He has been an occasional pipe smoker for about 20 years but had no other exposure to toxic chemicals except for the contaminated water supply. He does not drink alcohol. Although an association is less clear, he and his wife had difficulty conceiving additional children for 10 years after the birth of their first child. His other comorbidities include coronary artery disease requiring stent placement, type 2 diabetes, and depression. There is no one else in the family who had cancer as far as he knows.  \n\nPatient #3  \nThe third patient is a 77-year-old Caucasian man who has a history of recurrent nasal papilloma and multiple skin cancers. He developed a severe de novo allergy while living at Camp Lejeune. Since then, he has undergone multiple surgical resections for recurrent inverted nasal papilloma. In addition, he has received nitrous oxide cryotherapy and repeated surgical resections for multiple and recurrent basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Most recently, at the age of 77, he was diagnosed with melanoma of the right supraclavicular chest for which he underwent wide local excision with clear margins.  \nHe lived at Camp Lejeune while serving as an active-duty marine for 2 years from 1967 to 1968. During the first year, he lived in a barrack in the division headquarters, located at Hadnot Point. During his second year, he and his wife moved to a married housing unit in Tarawa Terrace. Following his discharge from the service, he worked in a suture and contact lens manufacturing factory at Johnson & Johnson, but he denied any occupational exposure to chemicals or toxins. He is a never-smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. He has a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. His mother, who was a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer, but no one else in his family has had cancer. Timelines of events for each patient are summarized in .  \n Timeline of events",

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed, which was followed by a cholecystectomy. The patient\u2019s diagnosis was discussed with a multidisciplinary tumor board, and chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and gemcitabine was initiated. Nevertheless, after two cycles, the patient\u2019s disease progressed. As previous immunohistochemistry had revealed a high PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell membrane, immunotherapy was initiated. After receiving the first dose of nivolumab (3 mg/kg body weight) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg body weight), the patient presented with mild epigastric pain. The pain was continuous in nature, but was not specifically described as chest pain. He had no symptoms of dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or changes in stool pattern. Furthermore, there were no signs of weight loss or anorexia. However, fatigue was more pronounced during the last week. Aside from the current cancer treatment, the patient was not on any other medication. No recent infections, vaccinations, or new medications were reported in the last few months. Prior to treatment initiation, baseline viral serology showed no history of human immunodeficiency virus-1/2 (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus. In addition, there were no reasons to believe that the patient had any active viral infections. Physical examination revealed no specific cardiovascular abnormalities (no signs of fluid overload or other evidence of cardiac dysfunction). The neurological and overall physical examinations were reassuring. Vital signs were also normal (blood pressure 114/73 mmHg, pulse of 72 beats per minute, and temperature of 36.8 \u00b0C). He was not known to have any relevant medical history, previous cardiac events, or cardiovascular risk factors. However, 18 years ago, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer that was subsequently treated with a nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Three weeks later, a blood sample was taken prior to the second dose of ipilimumab-nivolumab and depicted a normal cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level; however with an elevation of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP level) [214.3 pg/mL; (normal level, < 125 pg/mL)]. The third dose of immunotherapy was withheld owing to asymptomatic troponinemia [43.02 ng/L; (normal level, < 14 ng/L)]. A nasopharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 57% and normal global longitudinal strain (GLS) of \u221218% with normal bull\u2019s eye, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) taken was reassuring . Moreover, creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase\u2013myocardial band (CK-MB) were within normal range, and 72-hour Holter ECG monitoring did not identify any signs of arrhythmia. Fig. 1 Initial electrocardiogram (ECG). Normal sinus rhythm without any irregularities Full size image The flowchart of the European Society of Cardiology, as described by Hu et al., was followed and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which revealed a subtle zone of contrast captation in the inferior segment of the left ventricular wall  [5]. Steroid therapy was initiated, that is, oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day. Troponin levels kept increasing (peak, 176 ng/L) despite steroid introduction ().

Cardiac catheterization revealed no remarkable findings [6]. The dosage of prednisolone was increased to 100 mg daily. Nonetheless, troponin levels kept increasing, and a follow-up fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), performed 28 days after initial onset, depicted multiple zones of active myocardial inflammation: basal septal, mid-anterior, and apical inferior . ICI therapy was permanently discontinued, and the oral dosage of prednisolone was further increased to 2 mg/kg per day. Subsequently, the patient experienced an episode of transient diplopia with vertigo that required hospitalization for further investigations. Brain MRI elucidated both infra- and supratentorial infarction. The MRI report described subacute infarctions in both the left and the right side of the brain (more present in the posterior circulation compared with the anterior). There were no signs of vasogenic edema or inflammation of the blood vessels. The specific pattern on MRI was highly suggestive for emboli of cardiac origin rather than vasculitis or a posterior reversible encephalopathy disorder. However, we could not detect any signs of atrial fibrillation, and TTE was reassuring. Aspirin 80 mg and 14,000 IU of tinzaparin once daily was started subsequently.

    "original_case": "A 75-year-old Thai man with a recent history of tuberculosis infection presented with an enlarged tonsil. Following an initial physical examination, the otolaryngologist sent the patient for computed tomography (CT) scan of his neck, which revealed that his tonsil was normal but that there was a mass located incidentally at his cervical spine at the level of C1/C2. There was no history of neck pain, gait abnormalities, or neurological problems. Physical examination revealed only increased tendon reflex of his upper and lower extremities. His neck range of motion was full, and his bowel bladder function was normal. Neither paralysis nor paresthesia was observed. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extradural enhancing mass at the right C1/C2 level compressing the spinal cord . Despite the subtle clinical neurological deficit, the MRI finding of severe spinal cord compression was concerning, and treatment options were discussed. Due to the high risk of creating instability following resection of the tumor, the treatment chosen was that of additional fusion of the upper cervical spine. Preoperative plain radiographs of the cervical spine and the upper cervical sagittal alignment are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1 T1-weighted, post-contrast injection magnetic resonance imaging images show an enhancing lesion at an extradural location with an intradural extension at the right side of the C1/C2 vertebrae in the coronal (a), sagittal (b), and axial (c) plane. The mass effect caused corresponding spinal cord compression with left posterolateral displacement. No obvious cord signal abnormality was seen. Plain film radiographs of the preoperative cervical spine in the anteroposterior (d) and lateral view (e) also show the measured angle of occiput-C2 (blue), C1\u2013C2 (red), and Takami\u2019s angle (yellow) of \u2212 23\u00b0, \u2212 27\u00b0, and 104\u00b0, respectively.\n\nA standard posterior midline cervical spine approach was carried out. Since preoperative imaging showed that both C2 and C3 pedicles were feasible enough to insert the pedicular screws, we decided to use the technique to achieve maximal strength and stability of the construct system assisted by the CT navigation system. The pedicle screw insertion at the C2 level was uneventful. However, lateral breeching was encountered during the insertion on the right side at the C3 level. Concerned for the risk of bilateral vertebral artery injuries, we switched to the lateral mass screw technique on the other side of C3. Intraoperative neuromonitoring using motor-evoked potentials and somatosensory-evoked potentials were used and remained unchanged from baseline throughout the surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, and while still in the recovery room, the patient complained of discomfort in his throat, accompanied by difficulty swallowing and opening his mouth. Bedside swallowing evaluation revealed some weakness of the neck muscles and desaturation following swallowing of a small amount of water (3 ml). He could not voluntarily cough sharply. The gag reflex was positive on both sides but delayed. Therefore, the rehabilitation physicians suggested keeping him with a nasogastric tube until further evaluation.\n\nPostoperative radiographic examination illustrated that the screw-rod system was intact and that the atlantoaxial alignment was neutral. CT angiography showed no VA injury with good distal flow. MRI of the brain did not demonstrate any evidence of stroke or suspected cause of dysphagia . Using the McGregor line as a reference of the occipital bone, the occiput-C2 and C1\u2013C2 angles were \u2212 1.8\u00b0 and \u2212 25.1\u00b0, respectively (the minus value indicates that the angle is in lordosis). The craniovertebral angle proposed by Takami et al. to evaluate the craniovertebral fixation angle, namely, the angle between the line parallel to the bony palate and the posterior longitudinal line of vertebrae of C2, was 81.1\u00b0. The space between the posterior border of the mandible and the anterior of the cervical spine was narrowed, as was the distance between the screw-rod fixation system and the occiput . Taken together, these findings led us to believe that the cause of the trismus and dysphagia was the position of the screws. Therefore, an operation to adjust the position of the C1 and C2 screws to be relatively more extended position was performed on the eighth day after the first surgery.\n\nFig. 2 Computer tomography reveals the right C3 pedicular screw trajectory, which involves the medial border of the right foramen transversarium and left C3 lateral mass screw (a). Postoperative computed tomography angiography demonstrated a patent of right vertebral artery and good distal flow (b). Postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging technique did not show any diffusion restriction (c, d).\n\nFig. 3 Plain radiographs after the first operation reveal the neutral alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The occiput-C2 angle is \u2212 1.8\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle is \u2212 25.1\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami is 81.1\u00b0 (c).\n\nComparison of intraoperative fluoroscopic images before and after adjustment of the implant positions revealed that following the adjustment, the alignment of the C1\u2013C2 level was more extended . The space of interest behind the mandible associated with the cervical spine and just beneath the occipital bone associated with the screw-rod system was widened.\n\nFig. 4 Intraoperative fluoroscopic images showing pre-adjustment (a) and post-adjustment (b) status of the screw-rod fixation system. Post-adjustment, the distance between both sides of the C1 and C2 screw head was shortened (as well as the length of both rods), thus creating the C1/C2 alignment in a relatively more lordotic position.\n\nFig. 5 Plain radiographs after the second operation show an extended alignment of the upper cervical spine region. The post-correction occiput-C2 angle was \u2212 13.7\u00b0 (a), the C1\u2013C2 angle was \u2212 32\u00b0 (b) and the craniovertebral junction angle proposed by Takami was decreased to 76\u00b0 (c).",

Despite no previous complaints of neck pain, gait abnormalities, or neurological issues, an increased tendon reflex was noted in both his upper and lower extremities during the physical examination. No paralysis or paresthesia was detected, and his neck range of motion was full, with normal bowel bladder function.\n\nThe case became more complex when an MRI revealed an extradural enhancing mass at the right C1/C2 level compressing the spinal cord.

The patient was a former smoker (20 pack-years) but had no history of drinking. His medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and Basedow\u2019s disease. Moreover, he was taking medications including telmisartan, amlodipine, atorvastatin, sitagliptin, metformin, and thiamazole. Physical examination revealed the following vital signs: temperature, 36.7 \u00b0C; blood pressure, 116/83 mmHg; heart rate, 109 beats/minute; respiratory rate, 20 cycles/minute; and oxygen saturation, 93% on room air. A large solid, nontender mass was palpated in the left anterior chest wall, and skin bruising was observed . The patient had poor oral hygiene due to periodontitis. However, his other physical examination findings were normal.\n\nThe hemogram results were as follows: leukocytosis of 13.1 \u00d7 10^3 cells/\u03bcL with left shift. The blood electrolyte levels and renal and liver function test results were normal. The C-reactive protein level was 178 mg/L. Hemoglobin A1c was 7.0%, and the thyroid function was normal. Blood cultures revealed no growth. Chest radiography revealed consolidation in the left middle lung . Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass-like consolidation in the left upper lobe . Consolidation caused rib erosion, and it extended directly into the anterior chest wall, deep to the pectoralis major muscle. FDG-PET scan showed increased metabolic activity (maximal standardized uptake value [SUV] of 24.6) in the mass . A primary lung tumor invading the chest wall was suspected. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchial washing and transbronchial biopsy, which did not reveal endobronchial abnormalities. After the procedure, the patient developed fever, and prophylactic antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg orally every 8 h for 5 days) was administered. Biopsy using a specimen collected from the lesion in the left upper lobe had unremarkable results. Culture of the bronchial washing sample was sterile. CT scan-guided transthoracic biopsy of the mass was performed. Histologic examination revealed granulomatous tissues. Because the transthoracic biopsy result was considered nondiagnostic, surgical resection was conducted for diagnostic purposes.\n\nSurgical extirpation of the mass with left upper lobe partial resection was performed. Pathological examination revealed the presence of sulfur granules and filamentous, Gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria in the inflammatory site . Tissue cultures for bacteria, fungus, and mycobacteria were negative.\n\nFig. 1 Physical examination findings of the chest wall Full size image  \nFig. 2 Chest radiography image upon presentation Full size image  \nFig. 3 Computed tomography scan image of the chest (a) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography image (b) upon presentation Full size image  \nFig. 4 Results of the histopathological examination conducted using a surgical specimen. a Hematoxylin and eosin staining (original magnification, \u00d7100). b Gram staining (original magnification, \u00d7400) Full size image",

The yellow arrow indicates a pancreatic cancer site\nFull size image\n\nWe performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy on the basis of the diagnosis of pancreatic tail cancer. In addition, a 5-min suppression and a 5-min resection were performed for the pancreatic cut end margin using a Powered Echelon 60 Green cartridge. Closed drainages were placed in the pancreatic stump and under the left diaphragm. The surgical time and hemorrhage volume were 267 min and 600 ml, respectively. \n\nOn day 1 after surgery, the patient had a serum amylase level of 1303 U/L but high drain amylase levels (drainage of the pancreatic stump: 52,270 U/L, left subphrenic drainage: 6626 U/L). The color tone of the drainage was wine red. \n\nOn day 4 after surgery, his serum amylase level was 134 U/L, and he was diagnosed with pancreatic fistula on the basis of the drain amylase level (drainage of the pancreatic stump: 420 U/L, left subphrenic drainage: 865 U/L). \n\nOn day 7 after surgery, the patient developed a high inflammation level and persistent fever, due to which a contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed . The findings showed spread of abscess from the dorsal side of the stomach to the surrounding lateral segment of the liver , and hence, a drainage tube was inserted under echo guidance .\n\nFig. 2\na\nContrast-enhanced computed tomography examination on day 7 after surgery.

The patient\u2019s condition was managed only by one pancreatic stump drain inserted during the surgery. Later, the drainage fluid volume was still approximately 50\u2013100 ml. \n\nOn day 36 after surgery, a contrast agent administered from the drain revealed the image of abscess cavity . However, we could not confirm a reduction in the abscess cavity. Nevertheless, we still made repeated attempts to adjust a drain location while periodically checking the size of the abscess cavity via imaging the drain.\n\nFig. 4\nThe abscess cavity was visualized by imaging from the drain on day 36 after surgery\nFull size image\n\nNo method other than drainage was used, and only drain changes were performed about once every 2 weeks. \n\nOn day 134 after surgery, the patient developed fever, for which we conducted a contrast-enhanced CT that showed the abscess cavity around the drain .

We injected solution A containing fibrinogen from the primary route of the double-lumen tube and twofold diluted solution B containing thrombin and calcium chloride with normal saline solution from the other route. We injected both fluids at the same time while removing the drain over a period of about 5 seconds to ensure that the entire abscess cavity was covered with fibrin glue. Solution A and the twofold diluted solution B were simultaneously injected, after which the fluid drainage was almost stopped with no fever or abdominal pain at the time.

During a routine abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), a tumor in the tail of the pancreas was discovered.\n\nA laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed due to the diagnosis of pancreatic tail cancer. To manage the pancreatic cut end margin, a 5-min suppression and a 5-min resection were carried out using a Powered Echelon 60 Green cartridge. Closed drainages were placed in the pancreatic stump and under the left diaphragm. The operation took approximately 267 min with an estimated hemorrhage volume of 600 ml.\n\nAfter the surgery, the patient registered a serum amylase level of 1303 U/L, with noticeably high drain amylase levels (drainage of the pancreatic stump: 52,270 U/L, left subphrenic drainage: 6626 U/L). The drainage was wine red in color. \n\nThe patient was later diagnosed with a pancreatic fistula, based on a decreased serum amylase level of 134 U/L, and drain amylase level (drainage of the pancreatic stump: 420 U/L, left subphrenic drainage: 865 U/L). \n\nSubsequently, he developed high inflammation levels and persistent fever.

She was well before the vaccination and did not have any pulmonary involvement on chest radiography or any symptoms suggestive of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. She was known to have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, although neither serological nor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was performed before and after vaccination. After receiving the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, she experienced muscle pain only at the site of injection. She had a medical history of microhematuria; the normal level of serum creatinine (0.60 mg/dL, reference 0.47\u20130.79 mg/dL) and microhematuria (3+, intense at qualitative score, reference negative) without proteinuria at the medical check-up 2 years ago. In her family history, her grandmother had hematuria (details unknown). Gross hematuria resolved 6 days after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine; however, microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field, reference 1\u20134 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (3+, intense at qualitative score) with normal level of serum creatinine (0.64 mg/dL) were found. She was admitted to our hospital 4 weeks after the second vaccination because of persistent urinary abnormalities. Microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, 0.15 g/g, reference < 0.15 g/g) were found, and the shape of red blood cells in urine was dysmorphic, which indicated glomerular hematuria. The serum creatinine level was normal (0.57 mg/dL). Physical examination results were normal, and her blood pressure was 123/74 mmHg. She was afebrile and had no lymphadenopathy, rash, throat erythema, or lower-extremity edema. At 4 weeks after the second vaccination, urinalysis showed microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, 0.30 g/g). However, the normal range of proteinuria is 0.11 g/day (reference < 0.15 g/day). Laboratory data of serum showed albumin were within normal range (4.6 g/dL, reference 4.0\u20135.0 g/dL), and serum creatinine was also within normal range (0.53 mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was within the normal range (5.4%, reference < 6.2%), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody (HCV-Ab) tests were negative (HBsAg, negative; reference negative; HCV-Ab, negative; reference negative). Serum immunoglobulins were within normal limits (IgG: 1171 mg/dL, reference 880\u20131800 mg/dL, IgA: 246 mg/dL, reference 126\u2013517 mg/dL, IgM: 95 mg/dL, reference 52\u2013270 ng/dL), anti-streptolysin O antibody (ASO) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) were normal (ASO: 40 U/mL, reference < 250 U/mL, ANA: < \u00d740, reference < \u00d740), and complements were also within normal limits (C3: 93 mg/dL, reference 80\u2013140 mg/dL, C4: 21.3 mg/dL, reference 11.0\u201334.0 mg/dL, CH50: 43 U/mL, reference 30\u201345 U/mL). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO-ANCA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic proteinase 3 antibody (PR3-ANCA), and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM-Ab) were negative (MPO-ANCA: < 0.5 IU/mL, reference < 3.5 IU/mL, PR3-ANCA: < 0.5 U/mL, reference < 2.0 U/mL, anti-GBM-Ab: 0.6, reference < 7.0 U/mL). To confirm the diagnosis, a renal biopsy was performed. Renal biopsy specimens (Fig. 1 a\u2013d) included 21 glomeruli, among which one had global sclerosis. In the remaining 20 glomeruli, one with increased cellularity of the mesangial cells and expansion of the mesangial area was observed (Fig. 1 A; periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining). Neither double contours nor spikes in the glomerular capillaries were observed. Segmental sclerosis, crescents, proliferation of endocapillary cells, and capsular adhesions were not observed. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis accounted for approximately 5% of the entire interstitium. Immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 b, c) demonstrated diffuse moderate-to-intense deposits of IgA and C3c in mesangial lesions (Fig. 1 b; IgA staining, Fig. 1 c; C3c staining). IgG, IgM, and fibrinogen levels were extremely weak, and C4 and C1q were negative. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposits in the mesangial and/or paramesangial areas . The Oxford MEST-C score (where M is mesangial hypercellularity, E is endocapillary hypercellularity, S is segmental sclerosis, T is tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis > 25%, and C is an active cellular or fibrocellular crescent) was classified as M0E0S0T0C0.",

Neither serological nor PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were conducted pre- or post-vaccination, but it was understood that she was not previously infected. She experienced localized muscle pain after the first vaccine dose at the injection site. Her medical history included an instance of microhematuria, with a normal serum creatinine level (0.60 mg/dL), detected during a routine medical check-up 2 years prior. Her family history revealed that her grandmother also experienced hematuria, although specifics were not known.\n\nSix days after her second COVID-19 vaccine dose, her gross hematuria subsided. However, a medical examination revealed microhematuria (> 100 per high-power field) and mild proteinuria, with a normal serum creatinine level (0.64 mg/dL). Persistent urinary abnormalities led to her hospital admission four weeks after her second vaccination dose. Further examinations confirmed the presence of microhematuria and mild proteinuria, with the shape of red blood cells in the urine indicating glomerular hematuria. Notably, her serum creatinine level remained normal (0.57 mg/dL), and her physical examination results were otherwise unremarkable.\n\nIntriguingly, serum immunoglobulin tests showed normal levels of IgG and IgM, but her IgA levels were low (IgG: 1171 mg/dL, IgA: 80 mg/dL, IgM: 95 mg/dL). Despite this, her kidney function appeared to be relatively normal with serum albumin and creatinine within normal ranges. The presence of low IgA levels raised the possibility of a selective deficiency of immunoglobulin A [IgA], a condition known to predispose individuals to infections, allergies, and autoimmune conditions. \n\nHowever, her renal biopsy revealed diffuse moderate-to-intense deposits of IgA and C3c in mesangial lesions. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposits in the mesangial and/or paramesangial areas. These findings are suggestive of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), despite the unexpected low serum IgA levels, a paradox sometimes observed in IgAN cases due to the body's immune response to the disease.

However, her symptoms did not improve after more than 1 year, so she was referred to our department for further examination. The patient had a medication history for depression, was gravida 2 para 2, and had received total hysterectomy for endometriosis. She had no smoking habit and no alcohol intake, no remarkable family medical history, and no exceptional socioeconomic background. Her medication included rivaroxaban 10 mg/day, spironolactone 25 mg/day, lorazepam 0.5 mg/day, eszopiclone 1 mg/day, duloxetine 40 mg/day, bromazepam 3 mg/day, pantothenic acid 300 mg/day, brotizolam 0.25 mg/day, olanzapine 2.5 mg/day, triazolam 0.25 mg/day, and magnesium oxide 750 mg/day.

Enhanced computed tomography (e-CT) revealed vein-to-vein collateral formation, and multiple AVF from the common iliac and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac and common femoral veins (Fig. 1 a, c). Her symptoms worsened despite the commencement of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) and standard compression therapy at her previous hospital. Angiography confirmed the AVF to run from the common and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac vein , with left external iliac vein flow proximally to distally. Ultrasound findings disclosed high-velocity arterialized waveforms in the external iliac and femoral veins. We first considered surgical repair for the AVF but opted against it due to the number of fistulas and their very complicated morphology. Her symptoms became progressively worse, which necessitated EVT from the common femoral veins for the occluded left iliac vein after repeated discussions among the vascular surgeon, plastic surgeon, and cardiologist. The patient provided sufficient informed consent for treatment before and after the procedure. We administered heparin 5000 units at the start of the procedure and maintained ACT at approximately 300 seconds. The procedure required a high tip load guidewire, such as Halberd\u00ae (ASAHI INTEC, Aichi, Japan) or Chevalier tapered 30\u00ae (NIPRO, Osaka, Japan), due to the very hard occlusion in the lesion. We completed successful wiring from the common femoral vein to the vena cava. Proximal protection to avoid a thromboembolism was deemed unnecessary in this case. After passing the wire, we were unable to get confirmation of the wire resting in a vessel by intravascular ultrasound. The patient had no pain, and her vital signs were stable. However, we decided to use a stent graft on this lesion for safety and to maintain blood flow. After balloon dilatation, we inserted two stents (VIABAHN\u00ae [W.L.GORE & Associates, Inc. AZ, USA] 6.0 \u00d7 100 mm and SMART control\u00ae [CARDINAL HEALTH, OH, USA] 10 \u00d7 40 mm) with slight overlap. Direct catheter thrombolysis was not needed since the final venogram showed good venous blood flow from the distal vein to the vena cava .",

Despite the commencement of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) at her previous hospital, her symptoms didn't improve.\n\nIn light of the persistent symptoms and elevated D-dimer levels, an initial diagnosis of acute embolism and thrombosis of the iliac vein was made. Further investigation with angiography revealed the AVF running from the common and internal iliac arteries to the external iliac vein, with left external iliac vein flow moving proximally to distally. Ultrasound findings revealed high-velocity arterialized waveforms in the external iliac and femoral veins.\n\nGiven the complexity of the patient's condition, we decided to perform an endovascular treatment (EVT) from the common femoral veins for what appeared to be an occluded left iliac vein. After providing sufficient informed consent, the patient underwent the procedure. \n\nDespite the initial diagnosis, the lack of symptomatic improvement post-anticoagulant therapy, combined with the angiographic and ultrasound findings, eventually led us to a revised diagnosis of Left common iliac vein occlusion with arteriovenous fistulas.",

No seizure or loss of consciousness had been reported. She felt fatigue as her sleep duration increased and her daily activities slowed down. At the same time, chickenpox lesions appeared on the surface of the skin and low-grade fever continued during those 11 days. The patient was married 5 years ago and has a 5-year-old child. In her history, she has had only one pregnancy without any abortion or stillbirth. Her menstruation period was regular, and the volume of bleeding was within the normal range. Before her pregnancy, a 3-cm myoma had been diagnosed by ultrasound. Owing to the breech position of the fetus and gradual increase in myoma size up to 30 cm, cesarean section was selected by horizontal incision. Laparoscopic myomectomy was performed 1 year after delivery, and owing to abdominal pain and discomfort, endometriosis was diagnosed with computed tomography (CT) scan at the site of the cesarean section about 3 years later. Continuous use of Diane-35 for 3 months was advised by her physician. Diane is a combination of cyproterone and ethinyl estradiol. At the onset of the headache, she had been taking the Diane tablet for 45 days. At the time, she had been taking painkiller drugs and the Diane tablet. She has no past systemic medical history or positive family history for neurological and gynecological problems. She was hospitalized.

He was the first child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents with no family history of hematological or congenital disorders. During the first month of his life, he gained weight exclusively from breastfeeding; however, he gradually started vomiting and having diarrhea. Laboratory examinations revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin, 52 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 37\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L) with the presence of schistocytes (8% of red blood cells). Mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were 84.4 fL, 30 pg, and 360 g/L, respectively. Reticulocyte elevation was inadequate (28\u2030 of red blood cells). Although lactate dehydrogenase was elevated to 1728 U/L, and total bilirubin and potassium were also elevated, direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative ().\n\n Results of laboratory examination at diagnosis Full size table Bone marrow aspiration showed hyperplasia and megaloblastic change of erythroblasts, both of which are indicative of megaloblastic anemia. Dysplasia of granulocytes was also confirmed, and the percentage of megakaryocytes was decreased . While further examinations were being performed, the patient suddenly developed pulmonary hemorrhage, resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest. Although the patient responded to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he developed severe hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Subsequently, he was started on intensive care including hemodialysis, plasma exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and frequent blood transfusions. On the fifth day of hospitalization, serum folate level was found to be undetectable (normal, 11\u201334 nmol/L). This led us to confirm that folate deficiency was the cause of the megaloblastic anemia. Although intravenous folate supplementation (folinic acid, 6 mg/day) was initiated, the patient died of circulatory failure 19 days after hospitalization . Examination of autopsy samples revealed that the megaloblastic change in his bone marrow had disappeared; however, the cause of pulmonary hemorrhage could not be confirmed. An amino acid analysis conducted before intravenous folate replenishment indicated high levels of serum homocysteine, serum cysteine, and urine cysteine, and a low level of serum methionine, which normalized after the administration of medication (). In Japan, all newborns are screened for metabolic disorders. On reanalysis of his neonatal blood sample, methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine levels were found to be normal (). Thus, the abnormal pattern of amino acids was consistent with HFM.\n\nFig. 1 Bone marrow smear examination at diagnosis. May Gr\u00fcnwald\u2013Giemsa staining, \u00d7400 magnification (upper) and \u00d71000 magnification (lower). Hyperplasia of erythrocyte series was confirmed and the red arrows were showing megaloblastic change; the ratio of myeloid cells to erythroid cells was found to be markedly decreased to 0.36. The nucleated cell count was 105\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L. The number of megakaryocytes was reduced (0.016\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L) for hyperplastic bone marrow.

    "rewritten_case": "A Japanese infant of three months was admitted to our medical facility presenting with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. Born to healthy, non-consanguineous parents with no known familial history of hematological or congenital disorders, the baby was the first child of the couple. Early in his life, the infant had been gaining weight through breastfeeding exclusively. But he began showing signs of illness with recurrent episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory results indicated severe anemia with a hemoglobin count of 52 g/L and thrombocytopenia (platelet count was 37\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L). 8% of his red blood cells were schistocytes. The mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were 84.4 fL, 30 pg, and 360 g/L, respectively. The elevation of reticulocyte was inadequate (28\u2030 of red blood cells). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated to 1728 U/L, and total bilirubin and potassium were also high. Both direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative.\n\nBone marrow aspiration revealed hyperplasia and megaloblastic change of erythroblasts, indicative of megaloblastic anemia. Dysplasia of granulocytes was confirmed, and the percentage of megakaryocytes was decreased. The child unexpectedly developed pulmonary hemorrhage which led to cardiopulmonary arrest. Despite successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the infant suffered from severe hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. He was then placed under intensive care, involving hemodialysis, plasma exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and frequent blood transfusions. Serum folate level was found to be undetectable (normal, 11\u201334 nmol/L), confirming folate deficiency as the cause of the megaloblastic anemia. Despite the initiation of intravenous folate supplementation (folinic acid, 6 mg/day), the infant succumbed to circulatory failure. Post-mortem examination showed the megaloblastic change in his bone marrow had disappeared, but the cause of pulmonary hemorrhage remained unconfirmed. Amino acid analysis before intravenous folate replenishment showed high levels of serum homocysteine, serum cysteine, and urine cysteine, and a low level of serum methionine. These levels normalized after the administration of medication. In a reanalysis of his neonatal blood sample, methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine levels were found to be normal. Thus, the abnormal pattern of amino acids was consistent with HFM. A genetic analysis approved by the ethics committee of Asahikawa Medical University (no. 18231) revealed a homozygous mutation of c.1166-285 T>G in intron 3. His parents were heterozygous for the mutation.",

Conservative treatment was given for left-sided condylar process fracture, axis fracture, right clavicle fracture, and right fracture of the distal radius. After his consciousness disorder improved, 4 months after injury, it became clear that the patient was unable to close his mouth. His TMJ may have been dislocated during intubation. The mouth presented in an open state, with lip closure incapacity (Fig. 1 a, b). Stenosis of the jaw dentition was demonstrated with labioclination of the front tooth, open bite, and xerostomia. The patient had a tracheostomy and could not evaluate the verbal response, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 11. Traumatic brain injury left paralysis of his right upper extremity. The patient was at high risk of aspiration pneumonia due to diminished swallowing function, so the previous doctor had performed an additional gastrostomy, which recovered his ability to eat.\n\nFig. 1 Facial photographs before treatment.

Therefore, we planned to perform right condylar resection using an intraoral approach. In addition, we evaluated the planned procedure using a three-dimensional model and confirmed that it would not disturb the jaw reposition, because the left condylar process fractures to medial. We confirmed that it was difficult to reduce and fix the old fracture and that it did not interfere with the reproduction of the original occlusion on the three-dimensional model, so we decided to treat it conservatively. We performed right condylectomy with the patient under general anesthesia. Manual reduction was performed again in a state of muscle relaxation, but reduction was not possible. After an incision was made in the buccal mucosa according to the sagittal split ramus osteotomy, the inside and outside of the mandibular ramus was revealed, and the coronoid process and the neck of the mandible were confirmed . The coronoid process obstructed the visual field, so it was cut and resected with a reciprocating saw . Using a saw and osteotome, the base of the condylar was cut and separated from the surrounding soft tissue to remove the condylar head (Fig. 3 c, d). We confirmed that the mandibular body had moved backward and that the molars could achieve the occlusion, and the wound was closed. Intermaxillary traction was started during the postoperative period using an intermaxillary fixation screw inserted in the alveolar region to improve occlusal deviation. Twenty-one days after the operation, a normal occlusion was obtained, and intermaxillary fixation screw was removed. During the 12-month postoperative follow-up period, no TMJ dislocation recurred, and the occlusion remained stable . After the operation, he was able to open and close the mouth by himself, and the lips could be closed, so that hypersalivation did not occur. His left condylar process was displaced inward owing to a fracture, but the opening and closing movements were possible because the hinge movement centered on the left condylar process.\n\nFig. 3 Right coronoid process and the neck of the mandible (a).

The patient had no known family history of malignancy, though he had a personal history of high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma, which was diagnosed 7 years prior to his presentation. This was staged as cT2N0M0 with a Gleason score of 4 + 5 = 9. He was treated with definitive radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with leuprolide depot for 2 years. While off ADT, his prostate specific antigen remained less than (nadir + 2) with a nadir of 0.12.  \nFirst hospitalization  \nThe patient presented to his primary care physician with a right-sided thigh mass. Before further workup could be completed, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with progressive shortness of breath and right lower-extremity edema. In the ED, he was noted to be tachycardic and hypoxic and admitted for further workup. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but positive for innumerable pulmonary metastases up to 4.0 cm in size. A contrast CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large, multilobulated, destructive mass of the superomedial right thigh and pelvis with associated pathologic fractures, as well as multiple hepatic lesions (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). A core biopsy of the right lower-extremity soft tissue mass was consistent with high-grade findings and stained positive for vimentin (Fig. 2 a\u2013e).

He was admitted that same day for consideration of urgent chemotherapy given the size and number of his pulmonary metastases. CT-guided biopsy of right lung mass was consistent with high-grade findings. Orthopedic evaluation determined he was not a surgical candidate for a hemipelvectomy given the extensive lung disease and oxygen requirements. Systemic chemotherapy was initiated with a planned 28-day cycle of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) over 2 hours on day 1 and doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) over 4 hours on days 1 through 3. Prior to doxorubicin being started, the patient decompensated requiring additional supplemental oxygen support with high-flow nasal cannula (50 L, 60%). Laboratory results were not consistent with TLS; potassium and phosphorus were within reference ranges and unchanged from prior, while uric acid was slightly elevated (8.5 mg/dL, reference range upper limit of normal 8.2 mg/dL).

Given worsening bilateral lower-extremity edema and significant fluid administration with cisplatin, hypervolemia was determined to be the cause of his worsening respiratory status, and the patient was diuresed with intravenous furosemide. He developed a multifactorial acute kidney injury (AKI) (CT contrast, cisplatin), though it resolved over time without hemodialysis. As his respiratory status improved, he received 3 days of doxorubicin therapy to complete cycle 1 of cisplatin/doxorubicin. Ten days after the completion of doxorubicin, the patient was briefly transferred to the MICU for hypotension, while in the ICU he was found to have an extended spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli bacteremia that was treated with meropenem. The remainder of his hospital course was uncomplicated, and he was discharged home with home intravenous (IV) antibiotics and oxygen on hospital day (HD) 28.  \nThird hospitalization  \nThe patient was readmitted 9 days later for scheduled cycle 2 of cisplatin/doxorubicin systemic treatment. Shortly after the cisplatin and doxorubicin infusions were started on HD 0 (34 days after initial cisplatin dose), he became more hypoxic, requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support to maintain his saturation. IV fluids and chemotherapy were immediately held, and the patient was upgraded to the progressive care unit (step down). At the time, the patient was clinically volume overloaded with significant bilateral lower-extremity edema. Over the next several days, the patient was diuresed; he continued to require BiPAP support to maintain SpO2 \u2265 92%. Given persistent hypervolemia, the decision was made for a trial of reduced dose ifosfamide (1000 mg/m2) monotherapy, with the plan to give daily on days 1 through 5. The patient received his first dose of ifosfamide on HD 7. On HD 8, the patient developed worsening hypoxia and tachypnea. The patient developed worsening metabolic and respiratory acidosis, and the diagnosis of TLS was made. The patient's laboratory values are summarized in .  \n Review of tumor lysis syndrome in sarcomas  \nFull size table  \nThe patient was treated with 4 mg of rasburicase, IV furosemide, and intravenous fluids. In accordance with patient and family wishes, the patient was not intubated for respiratory failure and hemodialysis was not offered. Overnight into HD 9, the patient continued to have worsening lactic acidosis despite maximal medical management and noninvasive ventilatory support. The patient\u2019s sinus tachycardia decompensated to asystolic cardiac arrest on HD 9, and he was pronounced deceased.",
    "rewritten_case": "Prior medical history\nThe patient is a 64-year-old Asian male with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He had no known family history of malignancy, though he had a personal history of high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma, diagnosed 7 years prior to his presentation. This was staged as cT2N0M0 with a Gleason score of 4 + 5 = 9. He underwent definitive radiation and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with leuprolide depot for 2 years. His prostate specific antigen remained less than (nadir + 2) with a nadir of 0.12 while off ADT. \n\nFirst hospitalization\nThe patient presented to his primary care physician with a right-sided upper arm mass. Before complete workup, he came to the emergency department (ED) due to progressive shortness of breath and right upper-extremity edema. In the ED, he was noted to be tachycardic and hypoxic and was admitted for further workup. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed no pulmonary embolism but numerous pulmonary metastases up to 4.0 cm in size. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the upper body showed a large, multilobulated, destructive mass in the upper right arm and shoulder with associated pathologic fractures, and multiple hepatic lesions. A biopsy of the right upper-extremity soft tissue mass showed high-grade findings and stained positive for vimentin. The patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms improved, and he was discharged home on supplemental oxygen and mechanical support for mobility.\n\nSecond hospitalization\nAbout a week later, the patient was seen in an oncology clinic and noted to be tachycardic, hypoxic, and with a high respiratory rate. He was admitted for consideration of urgent chemotherapy due to the size and number of his pulmonary metastases. A CT-guided biopsy of right lung mass was consistent with high-grade findings. As the patient's respiratory status worsened, he was treated with intravenous furosemide and his condition improved. The patient was discharged home with home intravenous (IV) antibiotics and oxygen on hospital day (HD) 28. \n\nThird hospitalization\nThe patient was readmitted 9 days later for scheduled systemic treatment. After the infusions started, he became more hypoxic, requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) support. Over the next several days, the patient was diuresed; he continued to require BiPAP support to maintain SpO2 \u2265 92%. Due to persistent hypervolemia, the decision was made for a trial of reduced dose ifosfamide monotherapy, with the plan to give daily on days 1 through 5. On HD 8, the patient developed worsening hypoxia and tachypnea. He developed worsening metabolic and respiratory acidosis. The patient was treated with 4 mg of rasburicase, IV furosemide, and intravenous fluids. However, the patient's condition deteriorated and he went into asystolic cardiac arrest on HD 9, and he was pronounced deceased.\n\nDespite the characteristic clinical findings of a high-grade osteosarcoma (OS), the initial presentation of the patient with a focus on the upper arm and shoulder, coupled with the localized inflammation and edema, could have led to a misleading diagnosis of osteomyelitis, particularly if the biopsy results were not yet available or misinterpreted. However, the patient's rapid deterioration and the presence of multiple pulmonary metastases are more consistent with the final diagnosis of high-grade OS.",

On examination, she felt pain upon palpation of the fifth metatarsal diaphysis and presented snapping during flexion\u2013extension of the left ankle. Ankle radiographs were considered normal, and dynamic ultrasonography demonstrated anterior subluxation of the peroneus brevis tendon with dorsiflexion (Fig. 1 A, B).

B Subluxated peroneus brevis tendon during dorsiflexion (green arrow) Full size image After 2 months of conservative treatment, the condition did not improve. Therefore, surgical intervention was suggested. Having explained the procedure and its possible complications, the patient decided to proceed with the operative treatment. In this case, isolated anatomical reattachment of the retinaculum was performed, as described by Ferran et al. [5]. The patient was placed on the operating table in horizontal dorsal decubitus position, under spinal anesthesia, and a pneumatic tourniquet on the upper thigh, with a cushion under the buttock of the operative side. An approximately 6-cm longitudinal incision was made along the route of the peroneal tendons, and the peroneus brevis sheath was opened longitudinally around 3 mm posterior to the posterior border of the fibula (Fig. 2 A, B). Fig. 2 A Lateral aspect of the left ankle, showing surgical incision on the skin and subcutaneous (black arrow). B Opening of the peroneal tendons sheath (black arrow) Full size image Subsequently, the bony surface of the lateral malleolus was scraped until a bleeding surface was visible, and two anchors were inserted along the posterior border of the lower fibula (Fig. 3 A, B).

No interventions were possible for treatment of the stroke, and it was managed conservatively. A week after admission, the patient developed increasing abdominal pain with melena. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed ischemia of the small intestines as a result of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. A laparotomy was performed, and 60 cm of ischemic bowel was surgically removed. The attending anesthesiologist placed a central venous catheter (CVC) in the right internal jugular vein. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the ICU. Vital signs recovered, and 2 days after surgery she was returned to the ward. Further diagnostics for coagulation disorders were initiated, after developing a stroke and mesenteric thrombosis under direct oral anticoagulation. Blood samples for Janus kinase (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL), homocysteine, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were drawn. Anticoagulation therapy was changed to therapeutic doses of dalteparin and clopidogrel. Six days after laparotomy, the patient developed increasing abdominal pain again. An emergency CT scan of the abdomen revealed occlusion of the distal superior mesenteric artery. Another laparotomy was performed, and a thrombectomy of the superior mesenteric artery was carried out, together with a revision of the anastomosis of the bowels. Unfortunately, the previously inserted CVC had already been removed. During surgery, a CVC was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and the patient was admitted to the ICU again. Postoperative routine radiographic imaging for catheter placement showed the CVC in abnormal position . A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated a left-sided partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. The tip of the CVC was located peripherally in the venous drainage of the left lung. This vein was shown to drain into the left brachiocephalic vein . The scan further showed minor parenchymal damage around the catheter tip. No associated other anomalies were identified. The CVC was removed, and a new one was placed in the right internal jugular vein. Three days after the second laparotomy, the patient was returned to the surgical ward.

Blue-colored iris was found since the patient was born. When he was 17 years old, juvenile open-angle glaucoma (OAG) was diagnosed. Trabeculectomy was undertaken in both eyes due to progression of visual field impairment and unstable intraocular pressure (IOP) when he was 18 years old (25 years ago). During 20 years of follow-up, the IOP ranged from 12 to 16 mmHg without antiglaucomatous medications. Bleb function of both eyes was very good. Recent vision in both eyes was best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.4 with \u22129.00 diopters (spheric) in the right eye and hand movement (HM) in the left eye. Twenty-five years ago, when trabeculectomy was undertaken, his BCVA was 0.8 with \u22126.00 diopters (spheric) in the right eye and 0.1 with \u22127.00 diopter (spheric) in the left eye. The central corneal thickness (CCT) of the patient was measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), giving measurements of 494 nm in the right eye and 499 nm in the left eye. His sight with both eyes was worsening with glaucoma progression. Five years ago, the vision in his left eye decreased to hand movement, and from that time on, he began to take antiglaucomatous medication with prostaglandin eye drops. Exotropia was found due to low vision and disuse of his left eye. Horizontal nystagmus in both eyes was detected. He has no dystopia canthorum. Slit-lamp examination revealed wide iris hypopigmentation in the left eye, just sparing a section between 1 and 2 o\u2019clock, and in part of the iris of the right eye, sparing sections between 3:30 and 8:30 o\u2019clock and between 10:30 and 12:00 o\u2019clock. It also showed clusters of pigmented granulations on the anterior lens capsule . Functional filtrated blebs were seen in both eyes (a, b).

Fundus examination showed diffuse loss of the nerve fiber layer and an excavated optic nerve head with advanced-stage glaucoma. The red, sunset-like fundus around the optic disc was seen due to a lack of pigmentation in the RPE layer. A normal retinal appearance can be seen in the area two or three optic disc distances away from the optic disc.

The patient\u2019s hearing test showed no neurosensorial hearing loss. Temporal bone findings were normal according to computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any cranial abnormality. Ocular examinations were performed on the patient\u2019s parents, revealing no abnormal results except for cataract. The physical and ocular examinations of the patient\u2019s son were normal. For genetic testing, blood samples (with EDTA anticoagulant) were collected from the patient and his family members (mother, father, and son). The genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAampBlood Midi Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the instructions. Candidate pathogenic mutations were identified by Sanger sequencing for all family members. The mutation was sequenced on an ABI 3730 analyzer (Applied Biosystem). Sites of variation were identified by comparison of DNA sequences with the corresponding GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) reference sequences using Mutation Surveyor software. Two mutations of EDNRB gene were recognized. The first (c.1111G>A on exon 7) leads to an amino acid change from glycine to serine at codon 371. This mutation is not found in the 1000 Genome, ESP6500, ExAC_ALL, or ExAC_EAS population databases. To confirm the c.1111G>A (p.G371S) variant, the patient and his parents were evaluated using Sanger sequencing, revealing that this mutation was inherited from the mother .

The EDNRB gene shows an AR inheritance pattern. Sequencing analysis revealed that there were two heterozygous mutations in the EDNRB gene in this patient, inherited from his mother and father, respectively. These two sites constitute a compound heterozygous variation.",
    "rewritten_case": "In this case, we present a Han Chinese man in his early 40s who has lived with blue-colored iris since birth. He was previously diagnosed with juvenile open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and has undergone trabeculectomy in both eyes due to progressive visual field impairment and unstable intraocular pressure (IOP). Over an unspecified period of follow-up, his IOP has remained between 12 to 16 mmHg without the need for antiglaucomatous medications. His eyes have demonstrated good bleb function post-surgery. \n\nHis current visual acuity in both eyes is best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.4 with \u22129.00 diopters (spheric) in the right eye and hand movement (HM) in the left eye. Previously, his BCVA was 0.8 with \u22126.00 diopters (spheric) in the right eye and 0.1 with \u22127.00 diopter (spheric) in the left eye. The central corneal thickness (CCT) of the patient measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is 494 nm in the right eye and 499 nm in the left eye. His vision in both eyes has been gradually worsening due to glaucoma progression. \n\nAt some point, the vision in his left eye dropped to hand movement, and he started using prostaglandin eye drops as antiglaucomatous medication. He also developed exotropia due to low vision and disuse of his left eye. Horizontal nystagmus in both eyes was detected. He has no dystopia canthorum. Slit-lamp examination revealed wide iris hypopigmentation in the left eye, sparing a section between 1 and 2 o\u2019clock, and in part of the iris of the right eye, sparing sections between 3:30 and 8:30 o\u2019clock and between 10:30 and 12:00 o\u2019clock. \n\nGonioscopic observation of the patient revealed heavy trabecular meshwork pigmentation, with a 45\u00b0 angle between the iris and the trabecular meshwork surface. Genetic testing revealed two mutations in the EDNRB gene. The first mutation (c.1111G>A on exon 7) leads to an amino acid change from glycine to serine at codon 371 and was inherited from the mother. The second mutation (c.553G>A) causes an amino acid change from valine to methionine at codon 185 and was inherited from the father. Both mutations were predicted to be deleterious.

    "original_case": "A 43-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of hypogonadism (on testosterone injections biweekly), chronic back pain, nephrolithiasis, and CRPS type 2, secondary to shoulder surgery performed at an outside hospital due to right rotator cuff and shoulder labrum injury, presented to our emergency department for severe extremity pain with new generalized ulcerations of unknown etiology. The patient complained of diffuse body pain that initially started in the right upper extremity and had been gradually worsening over the last 1.5 years. On presentation, the pain was scored as 9 on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = no pain; 10 = most severe possible pain). He described the pain with dysesthetic qualities, including a stabbing sensation where the ulcers were located and a burning sensation throughout his body. In addition to the diffuse pain, his wound management program had been unsuccessful in helping his wounds heal, with constant open sores and bleeding. Approximately 18 months prior, the patient developed an inflammatory brachial plexopathy with new-onset burning and numbness following a right shoulder operation. Initially, the concern was for Parsonage\u2013Turner syndrome related to the postinflammatory neuropathy that may exist after surgery. However, he experienced sympathetically mediated alteration in skin coloration, hyperhidrosis, and vasomotor instability and was ultimately diagnosed with CRPS. Symptomatic treatments included both conservative (physical therapy and oral medications) and interventional techniques, including two fluoroscopic-guided stellate ganglion blocks that provided mild relief of symptoms. Over the next few months, his condition worsened, and eventually CRPS-like features including dysesthetic pain progressed to the other three extremities as well. Given the multifocal appendicular involvement, the patient received fluoroscopic-guided bilateral lumbar sympathetic blocks, with minimal improvement. Six months after his CRPS diagnosis, the patient developed large ulcerative lesions throughout all four extremities that initially began \u201cas a patch of blisters that stretched from his dorsal wrist to inferior mid-forearm.\u201d The patient went to a local dermatologist, who performed biopsies that were inconclusive. He was started on a trial of steroids with 80 milligrams (mg) prednisone oral daily. Despite initiation of steroids, his ulcerations continued to worsen. He started using triple antibiotic cream and taking Epsom salt baths. He had a colonoscopy that did not show any evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. He was also receiving weekly therapy by a licensed psychologist. The patient lived at home in a healthy, supportive environment with his wife and children. He was unemployed at the time of his presentation. He denied alcohol or illicit drug use. He had 1 pack-year cigarette history; however, he quit tobacco use over 10 years before his presentation. The patient did not have any known family history of ulcerating disorders. The patient\u2019s vital signs on initial presentation included a temperature of 36.9 \u00b0C, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 170/99 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). On physical examination, his bilateral arms had \u201cmultiple shallow-based ulcers with a necrotic center but [had] granulation tissue once some of the fibrin [was] removed.\u201d The ulcers had a non-heaped-up, discretely demarcated erythematous border (Figs. 1, 2). There was no odor. On the bilateral lower extremities, there were large, deeper ulcerations with exposed granulation tissue. The patient did not have any ulcers on his chest, abdomen, or back. On neurologic examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II through XII were intact. Strength was limited by give-way weakness in the setting of his pain. He had normal deep tendon reflexes, normal sensory examination, and normal gait. The patient was admitted to the dermatology service and underwent an extensive yet unrevealing workup. Hemoglobin was 14.5 grams per deciliter, platelet count was 225,000 per microliter, and white count was 15,000 per microliter. Anti-phospholipids, anti-dsDNA, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were all normal. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were both within normal limits, as well. An amyloid study was performed but was negative. During work-up, he was found to have a small monoclonal IgM lambda within the gamma fraction. Hematology recommended obtaining immunoglobulin levels and free light chains, which were normal. Bacterial and fungal tissue cultures were obtained from the ulcers, which revealed pseudomonal and enterococcus growth. He was started on levofloxacin. Biopsies were inconclusive, showing relatively normal skin. His ulcers were treated with vinegar-based dressings, hydrotherapy with potassium permanganate, and multiple irrigation and debridements. Superficial ulcers were treated with petroleum jelly, gauze, and elastic bandages. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was considered, but ultimately not performed due to the history and location of the lesions. Fig. 1 Erythematous ulcer with a well-defined non-heaped-up border on the right upper extremity Full size image Fig. 2 Multiple ulcers of varying severity and sizes noted on the left upper extremity Full size image Electromyography showed an absent right medial antebrachial cutaneous sensory nerve response, with the remainder of the nerve conduction studies being normal. There was no evidence of a generalized peripheral neuropathy or of multiple mononeuropathies. The inpatient pain medicine service was consulted immediately on presentation given his complex analgesic history. At home, the patient was on a fentanyl transdermal patch 50 micrograms per hour (mcg/hour) with intermittent use of morphine 15\u201330 mg by mouth every 3 hours. Adjunctive treatments included clonazepam 1 mg oral twice daily, clonidine 0.4 mg oral twice daily, gabapentin 1200 mg oral three times daily, and nabumetone 1000 mg oral twice daily. He also took escitalopram 20 mg oral daily for treatment of depression and anxiety. He endorsed both neuropathic and somatic components to his pain. Pain was exacerbated with movement and relieved with pain medications. While in the hospital, he was transitioned to methadone with increasing doses to 15 mg by mouth three times per day. He was also started on a ketamine infusion at 0.2 milligrams per kilogram per hour (mg/kg/hour), amitriptyline 50 mg oral daily, and acetaminophen 500 mg oral every 6 hours. He remained on a ketamine infusion for 5 days, with dosages ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/hour. Morphine was decreased from 15 to 45 mg oral every 3 hours as needed to 7.5\u201315 mg every 3 hours as needed. With these changes there was good symptom control, improved sleep, and diminished cognitive slowing, compared with his fentanyl patches. He also was able to change his clothes more easily.",

    "original_case": "We report the case of a healthy 29-year-old Caucasian, married, male patient with no major past medical history except Vitiligo\u2019s disease presenting with signs of a condition 11 days post vaccination with an adenoviral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 [ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)]. The patient had no history of exposure to tobacco, alcohol, or drugs and presented with an unremarkable family, environmental, employment, and psychosocial history. He exercised regularly and was on a vegetarian diet. The patient did not take any chronic medication and had no known allergies. He presented 11 days post vaccination to the outpatient emergency medical service with nausea and abdominal pain progressing for the previous 2 days. On physical examination the patient was fully orientated [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 15] without any neurological pathologies and showed stable vital parameters (respiratory rate 15/minute, SpO2 97%, heart rate 80/minute, blood pressure 123/62 mmHg, body temperature 36.7 \u00b0C). He was consecutively discharged, being suspected of suffering from food poisoning. However, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, resulting in hospital admission the next day with symptoms of vomiting, hemoptysis, melena, fever, and deteriorating health condition. His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, his heart rate 100/minute, his respiratory rate 25/minute, his SpO2 97%, and his body temperature was 36.9 \u00b0C. Presenting with a GCS of 15, there were no pathological findings on neurological examination. The patient\u2019s full blood count on admission showed severe thrombocytopenia (13,000/\u00b5l).\n\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed free perihepatic, perisplenic fluid and active endoluminal bleeding at the ileocecal passage (spot sign). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed, detecting a congestive gastropathy and hemorrhagic gastritis with no signs of active bleeding. The patient received an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (40 mg pantoprazole intravenously). Anemia and thrombocytopenia were treated by transfusion of 4 units of red blood cells (RBC) and 2 units of platelets (PLT). Due to the lack of the past medical history of the patient regarding his vaccination, autoimmune thrombocytopenia was suspected, and a dose of intravenous corticosteroids was given (500 mg prednisolone). The next day, the patient developed hemorrhagic shock. The patient was intubated and sedated with intravenous propofol 2% (2 mg/kg/hour) and sufentanil (30 \u00b5g/hour) infusion and required continuous infusion of noradrenaline (0.2 \u00b5g/kg/minute) to stabilize his blood pressure. Spontaneous atraumatic splenic rupture, diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound, required emergent exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy. The small intestine presented with ischemic demarcation. Due to extended coagulopathy, intraoperative blood loss of 3 liters required massive transfusion of 8 units of RBC, 2 lyophilized units of plasma, 2 units of PLT, 1 g tranexamic acid, 2 g fibrinogen, and 1800 units of prothrombin complex. The abdomen was packed and left open. With persisting hemodynamic instability and hemorrhagic coagulopathy (see laboratory values in ), the patient was transferred (intubated and sedated) to our tertiary hospital ICU (University Hospital of Cologne, UKK; see timeline in Fig. 1). Another abdominal CT detected dilated small intestine with edematous thickened walls and occlusion of the portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric vein . Colleagues from the Department of General Surgery and the Department of Radiology decided conclusively due to the extended thrombosis to firstly reduce the venous congestion and restore portomesenteric blood flow by thrombectomy and placement of a TIPS: A 10 F sheath was inserted via the right jugular vein, and 5000 units of unfractionated heparin were injected intravenously. A thrombectomy catheter was inserted via the TIPS into the superior mesenteric vein (Fig. 2 B, C), and an interventional aspiration thrombectomy and local lysis therapy was initiated: a bolus of 10 mg tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA, Alteplase) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of rtPA (at a rate of 1.5 mg/hour). During the procedure, there was another blood loss of approximately 1 liter, requiring the transfusion of a further 3 units of RBC and 2 units of PTL. Blood pressure was stabilized with continuous intravenous noradrenaline (0.4 \u00b5g/kg/minute) and vasopressin (2 Units/hour) infusion. The intravenous dose of pantoprazole was increased to 160 mg (continuous infusion) per day for the next 3 days. Due to the suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia, treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated (3 \u00d7 4.5 g/day) for 7 days of treatment. Microbiology screening of tracheal secretions revealed small amounts of Serratia liquefaciens (sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam) and Candida albicans. Under antimicrobial treatment, inflammatory markers decreased and respiratory function improved.\n\nParallel to this intervention, the patient\u2019s past medical history revealed that he had received his first vaccination dose of a vector vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), AstraZeneca) 14 days before. This finally raised suspicion of a condition, and intravenous immune globulins (IVIG) were administered to the patient: 80 g IVIG (1g/kg body weight Octagam\u00ae; Octapharma GmbH, Langenfeld, Germany, for the patient\u2019s body weight of 80 kg) for two consecutive days. Before administration of IVIG, blood samples were taken for immunologic assays for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II, thrombocytopenia, and thrombophilia screening (). Anticoagulation was managed with a direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban with dosage of 0.15\u20130.25 \u00b5g/kg/minute). Coagulation screening [blood count, plasmatic coagulation, thrombelastometry (ROTEM)] was run 6-hourly. A rapid HIT II screening test (ID-PaGIA heparin/PF4-antibody test kit, Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Feldkirchen, Germany) showed a negative result. An IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Immunocor GTI Diagnostics, Inc., Waukesha, WI USA) was positive (odds ratio 2.35). With hemodynamic stabilization of the patient, continuous intravenous infusion of vasopressin could be stopped and parenteral feeding initiated.\n\nDay 15 post vaccination (see timeline in Fig. 1), another angiography revealed reduced flow in the portal and superior mesenteric vein due to residual thrombus material. A further aspiration thrombectomy was performed, resulting in restoration of hepatopetal portomesenteric blood flow.\n\nOn day 16 post vaccination, the abdominal packing was removed, the ischemically demarked parts of the small intestine (190 cm) were resected, and the remaining intestine (approximately 100 cm) was connected in the form of a side-to-side duodeno-ileostomy. As the thrombocyte count continued to stabilize, thrombocyte aggregation could be blocked with acetylsalicylic acid (ASS 100 mg intravenously) to prevent clotting of the essential TIPS. The patient could be extubated, his abdominal pain was sufficiently treated with slow-release oral morphine (3 \u00d7 10 mg), and enteral feeding could be started.",

He was initially suspected of suffering from food poisoning and discharged. \n\nHowever, the patient\u2019s condition worsened and he was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of vomiting, hemoptysis, melena, fever, and a deteriorating health condition. The patient\u2019s full blood count on admission showed severe thrombocytopenia (13,000/\u00b5l). Following a rapid decline in his condition, he was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU). \n\nAn abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed free perihepatic, perisplenic fluid, and active endoluminal bleeding at the ileocecal passage (spot sign). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed, revealing a congestive gastropathy and hemorrhagic gastritis without signs of active bleeding. The patient was treated with an intravenous proton pump inhibitor, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were managed by transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) and platelets (PLT). Autoimmune thrombocytopenia was suspected, and a dose of intravenous corticosteroids was administered.\n\nThe patient\u2019s condition further deteriorated, leading to hemorrhagic shock. He was intubated and sedated, and required continuous infusion of noradrenaline to stabilize his blood pressure. He faced a spontaneous atraumatic splenic rupture, diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound, which required emergent exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy. With persisting hemodynamic instability and hemorrhagic coagulopathy, he was transferred to our tertiary hospital ICU (University Hospital of Cologne, UKK). \n\nAnother abdominal CT detected dilated small intestine with edematous thickened walls and occlusion of the portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric vein. An interventional aspiration thrombectomy and local lysis therapy were performed. His blood pressure was stabilized with continuous intravenous noradrenaline and vasopressin infusion. He was also treated with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam due to the suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Microbiology screening of tracheal secretions revealed small amounts of Serratia liquefaciens and Candida albicans.\n\nThe patient's past medical history revealed his vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), AstraZeneca, which led to the suspicion of a condition. Therefore, intravenous immune globulins (IVIG) were administered. Anticoagulation was managed with a direct thrombin inhibitor. A rapid HIT II screening test showed a negative result, however, an IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was positive.\n\nFurther angiography revealed reduced flow in the portal and superior mesenteric vein due to residual thrombus material. Another aspiration thrombectomy was performed, resulting in the restoration of hepatopetal",
