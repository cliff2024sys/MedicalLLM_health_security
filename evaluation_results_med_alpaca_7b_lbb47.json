    "original_case": "A 12-year-old Syrian boy was transferred to our hospital with complaints of recurrent bilious vomiting, constipation, and crampy abdominal pain for 6 days. His physical examination showed abdominal distention and tenderness. The vital signs were stable, and there was mild dehydration. All laboratory results were normal. Plain X-rays revealed a dilated bowel with air\u2013fluid levels. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study showed dilated bowels in the upper part of the abdomen, including the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum . Intravenous fluids were administered, and nasogastric tubes were placed. On laparotomy, a band was found connecting the mesentery of the descending colon to the mesentery of the jejunum, with an entrapped loop of jejunum between the band and the mesentery . The appearance of the intestines was normal with normal blood supply. This band was ligated and excised without bowel resection . Histological examination revealed fibrotic tissue with blood vessels and no malignant changes.",
    "rewritten_case": "A pre-teen Syrian boy was brought into our medical facility presenting with symptoms of recurring bilious vomiting, constipation, and intermittent abdominal pain. Upon examination, there was noticeable abdominal distention and tenderness. The boy was slightly dehydrated, but other vital signs remained stable. Routine lab tests did not show any abnormalities. \n\nA plain X-ray displayed an enlarged bowel accompanied by air-fluid levels. Further investigation with an upper gastrointestinal contrast study revealed dilation of the upper abdominal bowels, encompassing the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. Intravenous fluids were immediately administered, and nasogastric tubes were inserted.\n\nA surgical exploration revealed a band connecting the mesentery of the descending colon to the mesentery of the jejunum. This band had entrapped a loop of the jejunum between itself and the mesentery. Despite this, the intestines appeared normal with an intact blood supply. The band was ligated and removed without the need for bowel resection.\n\nHistological examination of the removed band showed it to be fibrotic tissue that contained blood vessels. Importantly, no malignant changes were observed. The presentation and findings were consistent with a congenital intestinal obstruction due to a mesenteric band.",

    "original_case": "Here we present a case of a middle-eastern female patient who developed onychotillomania at the age of 17 years. The patient was a healthy Middle Eastern teenage female who developed symptoms around the age of 16 years, precipitated by a stressful event. The patient experienced recurrent, intrusive, distressing, and time-consuming obsessional thoughts of being surveilled through her phone. These obsessions also made her functionally impaired. Consequently, the patient started to avoid using the phone and eventually damaged it. Nevertheless, her symptoms persisted even with a new phone. Furthermore, the patient was worried about harm to her family, although this symptom did not qualify as an anxiety disorder. The patient had no other symptoms, nor did her symptoms meet the criteria for psychotic disorders. She was under the care of another physician at the time of onset of the condition, and was treated with fluoxetine, which was changed to paroxetine with clear justification. The patient commenced paroxetine 20 mg titrated to 30 mg daily and started showing improvements. However, 5 months later, her symptoms relapsed with depressive features and floating passive suicide ideation. Additionally, she demonstrated nail picking that was mainly directed towards the big toes and the skin around the nails using only her fingers. On examination, the lateral nail fold was erythematous and swollen with bleeding in both big toes, which may indicate a distolateral ingrowth and the nails showed scales and signs of distal nail tearing by the patient. Sometimes the patient\u2019s injuries required bandaging (Figs. 1 and 2). These symptoms were distressing, occurred daily, and were preceded by an urge and followed by a relief. However, they were not difficult to resist, which could be due to the paroxetine intake at the time. This complaint was not related to anxiety or depressive symptoms, and the patient had no other body-focused repetitive behaviors. Subsequently, the dose of paroxetine was increased to 40 mg. Two months later, the patient started to experience side effects that included weight gain and difficulty in urination. Medication was switched to fluoxetine at a dose of 20 mg titrated, which was later increased to 40 mg daily. After the resolution of symptoms, upon the patient\u2019s request, 6\u20137 months later, the medication was reduced. The fluoxetine dose was tapered and discontinued over 3 months without any relapse in symptoms. However, 2\u20133 months later, the symptoms relapsed and treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg was recommenced. At the time of writing this report, approximately 2 months after restarting fluoxetine, the patient\u2019s condition had partially improved and the nail-picking behavior remained remitted.",
    "rewritten_case": "In this case, we discuss a female patient of Middle Eastern descent who was diagnosed with onychotillomania. The patient initially presented with symptoms after a stressful life event. She was healthy prior to the onset, with her symptoms manifesting as recurring, intrusive, and distressing obsessional thoughts of being surveilled through her phone. This obsession led to a functional impairment, causing her to avoid using her phone and subsequently damaging it. However, her symptoms persisted, even with a new phone. \n\nThe patient also expressed concerns for her family's safety, although these worries did not meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder. Furthermore, her symptoms did not align with a psychotic disorder diagnosis. The patient was under the care of another healthcare provider when her symptoms first appeared. She was initially treated with fluoxetine, which was later switched to paroxetine for reasons clearly explained by her doctor.\n\nOver time, the patient started showing improvement after being prescribed paroxetine. However, after an unspecified duration, her symptoms returned, this time with depressive features and passive suicidal ideation. Another notable symptom was nail picking, primarily focused on her big toes and the skin surrounding the nails. Upon examination, erythema and swelling, along with bleeding in both big toes, were observed, which could indicate distolateral ingrowth. The patient's nails also showed signs of tearing, presumably self-inflicted.\n\nThese symptoms were distressing for the patient, occurring frequently and characterized by an initial urge followed by relief. Notably, these symptoms were not difficult for the patient to resist which might have been influenced by her paroxetine intake. It's important to note that these symptoms were not associated with anxiety or depression, and the patient did not exhibit any other body-focused repetitive behaviors.\n\nAs a result, her paroxetine dosage was increased. However, after some time, she began experiencing side effects, including weight gain and difficulty urinating. Consequently, her medication was switched back to fluoxetine. After her symptoms subsided, the patient requested a reduction in medication. The fluoxetine dose was tapered and eventually discontinued without any immediate relapse in symptoms. \n\nUnfortunately, the patient's symptoms returned after an undisclosed period, prompting the resumption of fluoxetine treatment. At the time of compiling this report, the patient's condition had partially improved and her nail-picking behavior had remitted.",

    "original_case": "A 39-year-old Middle Eastern/Persian male with a known case of left lower extremity varicose vein was referred to our vascular surgery service with a chief complaint of left inguinal bulging since 15 years ago. He was asymptomatic and reported no pain or restrictions in movement or other clinical findings aside from the bulging, which resolved under local pressure. The patient had been misdiagnosed and operated on 10 years ago with the impression of a left inguinal hernia; however, no hernia sac was detected at that time. Five years later, the patient developed left lower extremity varicose veins. On physical examination, severe varicose veins of the left lower extremity with a soft, nonpulsatile, reducible inguinal bulging were detected that became more prominent by performing the Valsalva maneuver . Fig. 1 A Soft, nonpulsatile, reducible inguinal bulging in the left inguinal area; B color Doppler sonography of the left lower extremity venous system revealed incompetency of the left-sided saphenofemoral junction; C histopathology section of the aneurysmal lesion demonstrating dilated uniloculated mass with endothelial lining, indicative of tunica intima (arrowhead) (\u00d7100 hematoxylin and eosin stain); D the lesion\u2019s wall cut section demonstrating thickening of the three layers of the venous histology with destruction of tunica media and its replacement by loose connective tissue with mild myxoid degeneration (\u00d7400, hematoxylin and eosin stain) Full size image On the basis of the patient features, color Doppler sonography of left lower extremity venous system was performed, which revealed left-sided saphenofemoral junction incompetence with severe flow reversal during the Valsalva maneuver . The patient was scheduled for surgery in which ligation of the left saphenofemoral junction and stripping of the saphenous vein, and stab avulsion phlebotomy of the left lower extremity varicose veins, were done. In the course of surgery, a 5 \u00d7 2 cm venous lesion with about 2 cm distance from the saphenofemoral junction was detected. . Subsequently, the lesion was resected and sent for pathological evaluation. . No complications occurred during the operation. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the next day after operation. After 1 month, the patient visited the clinic with an uneventful postoperative course and without any complaint.

    "rewritten_case": "A Middle Eastern/Persian male, approximately in his late 30s, with a known history of varicose veins in the left lower extremity, presented to our vascular surgery department. His main concern was an inguinal bulge on the left side that had been present for a significant duration. He reported no symptoms such as pain or movement restrictions, and no other clinical findings were apparent except the bulge, which was alleviated by local pressure.\n\nThe patient had previously undergone surgery under the mistaken diagnosis of a left inguinal hernia, but no hernia sac was found during the procedure. Some time after this operation, he developed varicose veins in his left lower extremity. During physical examination, severe varicose veins were evident, along with a soft, nonpulsatile, reducible inguinal bulge. This bulge became more conspicuous when the patient performed the Valsalva maneuver.\n\nColor Doppler sonography of the left lower extremity venous system was done based on the patient's symptoms and history, and it revealed incompetence of the left-sided saphenofemoral junction, with severe flow reversal during the Valsalva maneuver. A decision was made to schedule the patient for surgery.\n\nDuring the surgical intervention, which included ligation of the left saphenofemoral junction, stripping of the saphenous vein, and stab avulsion phlebotomy of the varicose veins in the left lower extremity, a 5 \u00d7 2 cm venous lesion was identified at a distance from the saphenofemoral junction. The lesion was excised and sent for pathology.\n\nThe operation proceeded without complications, and the patient was discharged from the hospital the following day. During a follow-up visit to the clinic, the patient reported no issues post-surgery.",
