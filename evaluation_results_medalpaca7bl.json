An upper gastrointestinal contrast study showed dilated bowels in the upper part of the abdomen, including the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum . Intravenous fluids were administered, and nasogastric tubes were placed. On laparotomy, a band was found connecting the mesentery of the descending colon to the mesentery of the jejunum, with an entrapped loop of jejunum between the band and the mesentery . The appearance of the intestines was normal with normal blood supply. This band was ligated and excised without bowel resection .

It is caused by the failure of complete obliteration of the vitelline duct, which connects the yolk sac to the developing intestine during embryonic development. Meckel diverticula can cause a range of clinical symptoms, including recurrent abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. On imaging, it appears as a dilated sac with air-fluid levels. Surgical exploration is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis and treat any associated complications, such as obstruction or inflammation. Meckel diverticulum is a relatively rare condition, but can be easily diagnosed and managed if properly suspected.\n\n\nAssistant:",

She had no history of illness, and biochemical parameters and tumor markers were within normal limits. Helicobacter pylori antibodies were negative, and EGD showed atrophic changes associated with previous H. pylori infection. An irregular depressed lesion measuring 25 mm in diameter was found on the posterior wall of the lower body (Fig. 1 a, b). Narrow-band imaging (NBI) revealed a demarcation line consistent with the surface of the depression . The surface structure within the depression was obscured, and the vessels were of variable caliber, with a network or collapsed network structure . Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with a well-differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma [tubular adenocarcinoma (tub1\u20132)], and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed . The resected specimen had the following histological parameters: 28\u2009\u00d7\u200928 mm, type 0\u2013IIc, pT1b(submucosa (SM) 900 \u03bcm), pUL(\u2212), Ly(+), v(\u2212), pHM0, pVM0 . Histologically, the tumor was composed of two components [tub2 adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine cell carcinoma (NEC)], and it showed submucosal and lymphatic invasion. As shown in Fig. 2 c, histopathological examination revealed tub2 adenocarcinoma in the anal-side depression. In the oral-side depression, tumor cells lacked glandular structures and had nested trabecular or acinar-like structures. Immunohistochemistry was positive for synaptophysin and CD56, and chromogranin partially, confirming the diagnosis of NEC. We determined that additional surgical resection was necessary due to submucosal and lymphatic invasion and laparoscopic pyloric gastrectomy was performed. The resected specimen showed no histological remnant of cancer and no metastasis in all the dissected lymph nodes.",

Twenty-one years prior, she was diagnosed with left clavicle ES and underwent surgical tumor excision. Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy, consisting of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide and etoposide were respectively administered. The patient also had a history of left breast cancer, treated with pectoral muscle-sparing mastectomy. Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy, consisting of docetaxel, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, were respectively administered 2 years prior. On admission, the patient presented with a headache, but no neurological findings were noted. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed a tumor extending superiorly and inferiorly from the cerebellar tent, along the left occipital bone with a contrast enhancement effect (Fig. 1 a, b). Osteolytic changes were observed in the left occipital bone . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed the tumor, exhibiting an isodense signal intensity on T1-weighted  and T2-weighted imaging . No signal was noted in the left transverse sinus on magnetic resonance venography. This suggested occlusion due to tumor invasion . The tumor extended to the left mastoid air cells. On 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET), the tumor exhibited a low uptake . No high uptake regions were observed throughout the entire body .

    "original_case": "A 57-year-old Chinese man who suffered from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm underwent craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation. No problems with swallowing or speaking were reported during the surgery. Unfortunately, the patient experienced dysarthria, dysphagia, and trouble with tongue movement after the surgery. Thus, we performed a detailed neurological examination. In addition to the symptoms described above, we also found symptoms linked to cranial nerve injuries, such as a weakened pharyngeal reflex, tongue deviation toward the affected side, atrophy of tongue muscle, and so on. Further evaluations and imaging examinations were carried out. The rating of the functional oral intake scale (FOIS) was level 2. Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) showed that the contrast agent leaked into the vestibule of the larynx and entered the trachea through the glottis when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid . The rating of Rosenbek leakage/aspiration scale was level 8, which is the worst level. When the patient drank 3 ml of medium-thick semi-fluid liquid, effective swallowing was not initiated and the epiglottis valley had a large amount of residue. When examined through the electronic laryngoscope, we noticed paralysis of bilateral vocal folds . All these observations indicated that the vagus nerve and hypoglossal nerve had been injured. Therefore, we thought that there may be a lesion in or near the brainstem that led to nerve injury. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that there were no brainstem lesions , and that the symptoms that arose after surgery could not be explained by the left frontal lobe malacia and subdural hematoma . Owing to the inconformity of symptoms and radiographic results, we decided to analyze the rare case again. When we reviewed the clinical history, we noticed that the surgery was performed under general anesthesia and transoral intubation, so there may be a connection between transoral intubation and nerve injury. After consulting with the ear\u2013nose\u2013throat (ENT) and anesthesiology departments, we excluded arytenoid dislocation and violent intubation. Then we found that these symptoms are similar to those of a specific syndrome, so we compared the characteristics of this case with diagnostic criteria of that syndrome. First, in terms of clinical history, the majority of cases occur following the surgical intervention under general anesthesia and transoral intubation. Our patient went through craniotomy evacuation of hematoma with general anesthesia and transoral intubation before these symptoms arose. Second, symptoms of the patient included difficulties in tongue movement, unilateral tongue paralysis, and atrophy of the tongue, as well as hoarseness and dysphagia, which matches the described symptoms of that syndrome. Third, the complete neurological examination showed that there are cranial nerve injuries and, based on the MRI results, we excluded lesions in the brainstem. Hence the symptoms are likely caused by peripheral nerve injuries. Thus, a diagnosis was made. Fig. 1 Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). A Aspiration occurred when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid. (before treatment, arrow, left). B A small amount of leakage when the patient drank 3 ml of thin liquid.

In the previous studies of that syndrome, only standard swallowing training was used as rehabilitation treatment, which proved to be effective but still means a lengthy recovery process. So we decided to include electroacupuncture as a measure in our treatment to observe the effect. The patient received acupuncture treatment 30 minutes per day, six times per week for 52 days . Qi She brand disposable, sterile steel needles (0.25\u2009\u00d7\u200940 mm; Wuxi Jiajian Medical Instrument Co. Ltd) were used. Based on our experience in treating similar diseases, we chose several acupoints to improve deglutition and speech function. These acupoints included the three-needle tongue (Shanglianquan, located in the depression between the lingual bone and the border of the lower jaw, 1 cun inferior to the midline of the jaw), and two other acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (note that the width of the interphalangeal joint of the patient\u2019s thumb is taken as 1 cun, approximately 25 mm), Dicang (ST 4, with the eyes looking straight forward, the point is vertically below the pupil, at the level of the angle of the mouth), Taixi (KI 3, in the depression between the tip of the medial malleolus and Achilles\u2019 tendon), and Zhaohai (KI 6, in the depression below the tip of the medial malleolus). Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation (EA parameters were set as follows: discontinuous wave with frequency 5 Hz, pulse width 1 ms, and intensity approximately 2 mA, until a slight jitter in the muscle is observed) was applied to two acupoints located at 0.8 cun bilateral to Shanglianquan (EX).

Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; the patient was referred to our department for surgery. He had hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, he had no family history of malignancy. The patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, D1+\u2009lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction in November 2019. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged 6\u00a0days postoperatively. The initial surgical specimen findings were as follows : a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200935-mm 0\u2013IIc lesion with shallow depression ranging from the upper gastric body to the hypogastric lesser curvature.

Although partial thickening of the gastric wall was seen retrospectively in a 1-year postoperative CT scan, it was reviewed within normal limits by a radiologist at that time . No evidence of recurrent metastasis was found at other sites. Fig. 2 One\u00a0year postoperatively (a), 2\u00a0years postoperatively (b).

Colonoscopy had been performed prior to the first surgery; hence, it was not performed again. The FDG-PET/CT findings were as follows : The soft tissue mass on the left side of the residual stomach showed moderate FDG accumulation (SUVmax, 5.25). No FDG accumulation was observed in other areas. Malignant lesions, including recurrent gastric cancer and regional lymph node metastasis, were suspected; however, qualitative diagnosis was difficult. No abnormal accumulation indicating recurrence and metastasis occurred at other sites. Fig. 3 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography.

FDG fluorodeoxyglucose Full size image Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed the following findings : the soft tissue mass on the greater curvature side of the residual stomach exhibited a high, heterogenous signal on T2-weighted images and a low signal on T1-weighted images, and contrast imaging revealed a slow contrast effect. Other malignant lesions such as gastric cancer recurrence, lymph node metastasis, and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) were considered as possible differential diagnoses; however, none of the findings were typical, and qualitative diagnosis was difficult. Fig. 4 Magnetic resonance imaging.

Transgastric ultrasonography revealed a 43\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u00a0mm borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum, which was biopsied using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Fig. 5 Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. A borderline oligo-hypoechoic mass in the splenic hilum Full size image The biopsy results were as follows: the tumor contained multiple spindle-shaped cells, and immunostaining for CD34, c-kit, desmin, S-100, and \u03b2-catenin was performed to distinguish spindle-shaped tumors; however, no significant positive findings were obtained. The biopsy specimen did not allow us to estimate the histological type of the tumor as it did not conclusively suggest a GIST, smooth myxoid, or schwannoma. Based on the above-mentioned examination results, local recurrence of gastric cancer, lymph node metastasis, a GIST, a smooth myxoid, and a schwannoma were regarded as possible differential diagnoses. Although the possibility of a benign tumor remained, a definitive diagnosis could not be made histopathologically, and moderate FDG accumulation could not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, we decided to operate for diagnostic treatment. Preoperative CT revealed a suspicious finding of splenic arteriovenous invasion; therefore, total residual gastrectomy and splenectomy were planned. The surgical findings were as follows: the abdomen was opened via a median upper abdominal incision. A 50\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u00a0mm soft tissue mass originating from the gastrojejunal anastomosis involving the spleen and splenic arteriovenous was observed on the greater curvature side of the anastomosis. Additionally, a partial invasion of the pancreas was observed. The remaining stomach, spleen, splenic artery and vein, and part of the pancreas, including the gastrojejunal anastomosis, along with the soft tissue mass, were removed as a single lump. Regarding reconstruction, only esophago-jejunal anastomosis was performed, sparing previous jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. The operation time was 279\u00a0minutes, and blood loss was 1100\u00a0mL; however, no blood transfusion was required. Pathological findings of the resected specimen were as follows : a 45\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u2009\u00d7\u200940-mm soft tissue mass extending from the muscularis propria to the serosa at the gastrojejunal anastomosis.

Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion measuring 40 mm in diameter along with moderate right pleural effusion . Fig. 1 Computed tomography scan showing very large pericardial effusion and possibly reflecting the presence of cardiac tamponade. There is moderate right posterior pleural effusion Full size image There was a spiculated anterior subpleural lesion measuring 28 mm extending to the anterolateral pleural surface of the right upper lobe  and significant enlargement of the mediastinal with right paratracheal lymph node measuring 15 mm and subcarinal lymph node measuring 18 mm and left axillary lymph nodes measuring 12.5 mm. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis was carried out. Fig. 2 Computed tomography scan showing right upper lobe speculated anterior subpleural lesion extending on the anterolateral pleural surface, suggesting primary bronchial cancer Full size image The pericardial and pleural fluid cytology contained small numbers of malignant cells, presenting predominately singly in a bloodstained background. These cells have enlarged pleomorphic nuclei with granular to coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemical studies showed positive staining of tumor cells for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), napsin A, and Cytokeratin 7 (CK7). Staining for Estrogen receptor (ER), Cytokeratin 20 (CK20), Caudal Type Homeobox 2 (CDX2), and calretinin were all negative. These findings are in support of adenocarcinoma of lung origin. In 2015, the fluid sample sent was not sufficient to undergo further testing to determine PD-L1 expression, immunohistochemistry testing for c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) / anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation, or molecular testing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). She had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 after VATS pleurodesis. The patient quit smoking at the time of diagnosis. She was then commenced on first-line chemotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 5), and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) 3 weekly at T = 1 month in February 2015. She completed four cycles with no dose reduction. Follow-up CT imaging was done 3 months later (T = 4 months) demonstrated good clinical and radiological response. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 [10], complete response was achieved with disappearance of the pleural based right upper lobe lesion. There is complete response to the mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph nodes. She was clinically well with maintenance of her performance status. Given the excellent response after first-line chemotherapy, she was then commenced on maintenance chemotherapy with pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 every 21 days. This is based on evidence that it prolongs overall survival and progression-free survival [11]. The patient completed eight cycles of pemetrexed without significant toxicities. In December 2015, there was single lesion progression with a new right upper lobe lesion (18 \u00d7 15 mm2) . The patient declined biopsy of this lesion. Given disease progression as per RECIST version 1.1, she was commenced on nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks at around T = 12 months in February 2016 owing to emerging evidence of immunotherapy in this setting for previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Fig. 3 Computed tomography scan showing a right upper lobe lung lesion Full size image After the commencement of immunotherapy, her follow-up scan done in May 2016 showed complete response of single lung lesion as per RECIST version 1.1. Further imaging subsequently every 3 months with CT of brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis continues to show no evidence of recurrence or new metastatic disease. At T = 59 months in November 2019, she had an elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis secondary to multiple cholelithiases. Her nivolumab was not withheld during the surgery, and she did not develop any complications during the perioperative period. At T = 63 months in March 2020, somatic gene mutation analysis was requested on her previous pericardial fluid and tissue sample done early in the diagnosis as the patient was not keen for rebiopsy. Reanalysis of the sample could be done using molecular testing. A mutation was detected in the KRAS gene p.(Gly12Cys): G12C (16%). No clinically relevant mutation was found in the tested regions of EGFR, BRAF, MET, RET, or ERBB2. It was negative for rearrangements in ALK and ROS1 genes. There was high level PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 80%. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan at T = 83 months in November 2021 showed no suspicious fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake within lungs. The foci of intense FDG uptake surrounding right lung pleura is consistent with a previous talc pleurodesis . Fig. 4 FDG-PET scan showing no suspicious FDG uptake within lungs.

The patient has been receiving oral treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes, and hypertension for 5 years. At first visit, the patient\u2019s height and weight was 163 cm and 50 kg, respectively. His blood pressure was 136/80 mmHg, pulse was regular at 62 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.3 \u00b0C. He had no history of smoking or drinking, and there was nothing significant in his family history. Physical examination revealed that his right testicle was elastic, hard, and enlarged to a size of 50\u2009\u00d7\u200950 mm^3. No obvious lymphadenopathy on the body surface was palpable, and no gynecomastia was found. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood biochemistry, urinalysis, and tumor marker levels (AFP, HCG, and LDH) showed no abnormal findings. Ultrasound findings showed a mosaic shadow inside the right testicle with no abnormal findings in the left testicle. Lung CT showed no evidence of coin lesions or effusion .

Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis, with distinct nucleoli and large nuclei, proliferating in a nest-like manner with some necrosis, and no specific differentiation tendency was observed. Vascular infiltration of tumor cells was also observed. The tumor was poorly differentiated (Fig. 2 A, B). Fig. 2 Histopathological findings showed a solid tumor confined to the testis; the tumor cells have distinct nucleoli and large nuclei; they proliferate in a nest-like manner with some necrosis, and no specific differentiation tendency was observed. Vascular infiltration of tumor cells was observed following hematoxylin and eosin staining (A: \u00d7\u200940, B: \u00d7\u2009100) Full size image Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for SF-1  and Ki-67 , partially positive for inhibin , and negative for CAM5.2, CK7, CK20, C-KIT, CD30, LCA, GATA-3, TTF-1, and PAX8.

    "original_case": "A 72-year-old Caucasian female patient, with a history of 40 years of smoking without any comorbidities presented with a non-healing, ulcerated lesion on the inner canthus of the left eye at the ophthalmology clinic. Surgical excision of the lesion was carried out in April 2008, with limited excision margins. The histological diagnosis was made. After being asymptomatic for 4 years, the tumor relapsed and the patient underwent a second surgical excision in August 2012. Resection was incomplete, with positive margins, so the patient underwent another surgery to have the tumor removed; however, histological diagnosis once again showed evidence of positive margins. Finally, radiation therapy was chosen as definitive treatment for the patient. Between December 2012 and January 2013, the patient received irradiation in 2-Gy fractions on the left halves of the forehead, glabella, nose, and on the left inner periocular eye regions. The patient attended follow-up examinations by the dermatologist every 6 months. Physical examination of the patient and an MRI scan of the affected area were carried out. The patient remained symptom free until 2018.\n\nIn June 2016, the patient presented with hematuria and was subsequently admitted to the urology clinic for cystoscopy and transurethral resection (TUR). Histological diagnosis confirmed a condition. Following surgery, the patient did not attend regular follow-up at the urology clinic, only at the dermatology clinic. Until 2018 the patient remained symptom-free.\n\nIn February 2018, the patient once again presented with hematuria at the urology clinic. First cystoscopy, then TUR was performed, and the histological diagnosis confirmed a condition, indicating the relapse and progression of the patient\u2019s tumor. Although both radical cystectomy and definitive radiochemotherapy were considered and offered as treatment options, neither was accepted by the patient.\n\nIn the weeks prior to surgery, once when the patient was blowing her nose, a cavity had spontaneously opened between the inner canthus of the patient\u2019s left eye and the medial meatus of the nasal cavity. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the facial skeleton, the cervical soft tissues, and the upper mediastinal regions was carried out in April 2018. The MRI scan showed evidence of the relapse of the condition on the skin of the inner canthus of the left eye, with the tumor invading the ethmoidal air cells in the left regions of the inner canthus and nasal root, as well as spreading into the nasal cavity and frontal sinus, cranially destroying the rhinobasis. For this advanced, locally invasive disease, the patient was given three cycles of treatment as first-line treatment without any adverse events. A follow-up MRI scan of the region, in September 2018, showed disease progression and the increased destruction of the skin in the left inner canthal region. To ascertain the histological type of the tumor, biopsy of the sinuses was carried out, which confirmed the presence of a condition. Based on the decision of the tumor board, the patient was given eight cycles of chemotherapy between January and September 2019. Follow-up MRI showed stable disease. Throughout the treatment, the patient\u2019s functional status remained ECOG 0, and no side effects were noted. Having reached the maximum cumulative dose of the chemotherapeutic agent, treatment with this agent could not be continued. Approval for a therapy was requested by the tumor board but was denied.\n\nTowards the end of her chemotherapy, in the summer, the patient felt a small lump appear in her left inguinal region, so computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed in September 2019 at the urology clinic. Although local recurrence of the condition could not be found, lymph node conglomerates could be detected in the aortic and left parailiac regions, and a soft tissue lesion in the left adrenal gland raised the possibility of a condition. Ultrasound core biopsy was performed from the left suprainguinal lymph node conglomerates, with the subsequent histological diagnosis confirming the metastasis of the condition.\n\nIn November 2019, the patient was referred to the National Institute of Oncology for further oncological treatment. Taking into account the recently completed chemotherapy for the patient\u2019s advanced condition as well as the metastasis of the condition, the tumor board recommended the administration of a therapy.\n\nBetween December 2019 and 2020, the patient was given cycles of treatment. Although not a requirement for second-line therapy, staining was carried out for tissue samples from both types of cancer. The sample tested positive for a marker, with a percentage of expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells, while the sample from the lymph node metastasis showed 0%.\n\nThe patient tolerated treatment well; she did not experience any adverse or side effects. Her blood tests were normal, and her performance status remained good (ECOG 0) throughout the treatment. Follow-up abdominal, chest, and pelvis CT scans in both February and June 2020 showed the regression of the lymph node conglomerates, while the lesion in the left adrenal gland remained stable, altogether indicating the regression of the patient\u2019s condition. Response to therapy was evaluated according to the criteria. CT scans of these regions showed evidence of complete remission in September and later on in December 2020 as well. Follow-up MRI scan of the facial skeleton and cervical region in September showed evidence of stable disease.\n\nOn 30 January 2021, the patient presented with symptoms of dehydration and arrhythmia at the emergency department. She was diagnosed with a condition, and was found to be COVID-19 positive. Over the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated, she developed bilateral pneumonia, became somnolent and died.

During surgery, he was intubated with a size 4.5 endotracheal tube and provided pressure-controlled ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure of 18, peak end-expiratory pressure of 6, and respiratory rate of 25. A large cyst measuring 8 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm originating from the pericardium was observed during surgery and was completely excised . The histological examination revealed a lesion composed of cysts devoid of a lining epithelium but separated by connective tissue with mature adipose tissue and lymphoid aggregates. There was evidence of chronic inflammation but no evidence of malignancy .

In January 2018, he received 70 Gy (35 fractions) chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin for laryngeal cancer. In June 2018, the patient underwent total gastrectomy and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (capecitabine/oxaliplatin) for gastric cancer. In October 2018, total laryngectomy was performed for laryngeal cancer recurrence. There was no postoperative wound issue, oral ingestion was started 1 week after the operation, and the wound progressed uneventfully. Subsequently, gastric cancer recurred in November 2018, and combination therapy with ramucirumab and paclitaxel was initiated. In January 2019 (3 months after the previous surgery), the total laryngectomy skin incision suddenly started to leak saliva without any warning signs, such as redness, abscess formation, or skin ulceration . Although ramucirumab was discontinued because the adverse event was thought to be caused by the drug, the issue continued to increase in size . It was managed with various conservative treatments, for example, antibiotics, discontinuation of oral intake, enteral feeding, and negative pressure wound therapy. In February 2019 (1 month after the development of the issue), it was closed using pectoral major musculocutaneous flap reconstructive surgery. However, shortly after the operation, a new issue appeared at a site different from the previous one. The new issue was again treated with the same conservative approach. This conservative treatment was performed for approximately 7 months repeatedly for new occurrences, and a second pectoral major musculocutaneous flap reconstructive surgery was performed in August 2019 (7 months after the development of the first issue). There was no subsequent relapse, but it took 8 months from the appearance of the first issue to complete closure . For 8 months, he was unable to orally ingest much of anything, nor could he receive chemotherapy for stomach cancer. In this patient, ramucirumab was administered for 2 months before the first surgery for recurrence of gastric cancer, and an issue developed 3 months after the total laryngectomy. The issue was intractable, and complete closure was achieved after 8 months. Anemia, hypoalbuminemia, underweight, and hypothyroidism were detected in the laboratory data (). However, considering the late onset of 3 months after surgery, this case was judged to be a complication of ramucirumab, a VRGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor.  \nFig. 1 The issue of Patient 1. a Issue (3 months after the total laryngectomy). b The issue continued to increase despite discontinuing ramucirumab. c A complete closure with two reconstructive surgeries (after 8 months from the first appearance of the issue) Full size image  Laboratory data at the time of issue formation in the two cases Full size table Case 2  \nA 71-year-old japanese man underwent subtotal tongue resection, cervical dissection, and flap reconstruction for oral cancer in March 2014.

Oral ingestion was initiated 1 week after the operation, and the procedure was continued without any wound complications. He later developed chronic myelogenous leukemia, and imatinib was administered in January 2021. In May 2021 (2 years and 1 month after the previous surgery), the total laryngectomy skin incision suddenly started leaking saliva without any symptoms, such as redness, abscess formation, or skin ulceration .

She was the fourth child in the family and was born as a result of a full-term, well-controlled pregnancy. No history of drug use or exposure to radiation during pregnancy was reported. Delivery was completed at the Gynecological center at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo, with a birth weight (BW) of 3600 g. Cholecalciferol (D3) for prevention of vitamin D deficiency was administered regularly. She was vaccinated regularly as per national vaccination calendar. She was breastfed for 1 year and a half, and supplementary food was introduced at 6 months of life. Her growth and development were normal. No relevant family history was reported. She was diagnosed with epilepsy 4 years ago. She initially presented with generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, and antiepileptic therapy, valproic acid, was initiated by pediatric neurologist. Despite treatment and compliance with therapy, seizures continued; therefore, a second antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, was introduced, and she continued to be on both antiepileptic drugs and comply with therapy. However, recently, she started to manifest hallucinations, emotional disturbances, and irritability, and the psychiatrist put her on fluoxetine. Later, she experienced cognitive decline, behavioral change, dysarthria, and difficulty walking. At admission, she weighed 40 kg and was disoriented, irritable, and unable to communicate. Physical examination of the musculoskeletal system revealed no erythema or swelling, but difficulty walking independently. Other system examination revealed no pathologic findings. Overall, the results of routine blood tests showed normal values; hemoglobin (Hgb) was 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count was 156,000/mm3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein was negative. Furthermore, liver enzymes, urea, and creatinine, as well as acid\u2013base status of the blood, were within normal values. Other investigations, including urinalysis, were negative, too. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses excluded infectious and immune-mediated etiology. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed, and the psychiatrist was consulted. Owing to progressive neurological status deterioration and lack of response to therapy, it was decided to send the child to a more advanced center abroad for genetic testing because of the inability to perform genetic testing in the country. At the same time, axillary skin biopsy was performed and inclusion bodies were detected. The results of genetic testing also confirmed the diagnosis by detecting a mutation on the NHLRC1 gene. Therefore, parental testing to confirm their carrier status was recommended, as well as genetic counseling. By the time the diagnosis was confirmed, the child had almost lost the ability to walk and speak. She could walk with great difficulty with the help of both parents on each side (the rest of the time via wheelchair) and could articulate a few sentences with difficulty. She still remains in this condition (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).",

He denied any allergies, history of sexually transmitted infections, smoking, and drinking, and had had no surgeries in the past. He had been administered broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone 2 g) intravenously following the suture, with no improvement. Untreated, such symptoms rapidly destroy the gliding mechanism, causing adhesion formation and giving rise to necrosis. Afterward, the patient began to experience pain and swelling at the injured finger, later over his entire hand and wrist area.

Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a multilocular cyst tumor, with solid components and a diameter of 6 cm, in the left ovary, and small-volume ascites. The tumor showed heterogeneity on the T2-weighted image and mostly low signal, but some high signal, which was not fat suppressed in T1-weighted images after fat suppression . Computed tomography (CT) showed no distant metastasis and no obvious abnormal accumulation in the thyroid gland. The patient\u2019s preoperative serum level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) was elevated to 84.9 U/ml (normal range <35.0), whereas the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC) were within their respective normal ranges.\n\nFig. 1 Magnetic resonance imaging findings.

C In T1 fat-suppressed and contrast imaging, the tumor showed heterogeneous staining in the low-signal part in T1-weighted image.\n\nTotal abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, and omentectomy were performed without any residual tumor because the intraoperative rapid histological diagnosis of the left ovarian tumor was suspicious for low-grade malignancy. The postoperative course, as well, was uneventful. Upon gross examination of the surgically resected specimen, the left ovary was whitish with tough elasticity, and the split surface was composed of polycystic formations with a solid area. Histologically, there were two patterns of histological subtypes: papillary carcinoma and poorly differentiated carcinoma . About 70% of the tumor was composed of follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland growing in a papillary fashion, while about 30% of the tumor had poorly differentiated carcinoma. In the area of the papillary carcinoma, the nuclei of the tumor cells were like \u201cground glass\u201d with coffee bean-like grooves . In the other area, full, nodular, and insular structures were observed, and nuclear fission images were confirmed . The immunohistochemical analysis showed that both components were positive for thyroglobulin; the Ki-67 (MIB-1) index was 5% in the papillary carcinoma and 35% in the poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\nFig. 2 Histological image of the ovary.

    "original_case": "A 35-year-old Mediterranean woman was diagnosed with a condition at the age of 7, when she was investigated for hematuria and proteinuria, confirmed by a renal biopsy on her father, revealing a familial chronic renal disease. Our patient was descended from a nonconsanguineous parent. Her mother was completely asymptomatic, while her father had been diagnosed with the same condition when he was 42 years of age, and he had been on hemodialysis for the last few years because of chronic renal failure. The pattern of this disease inheritance in her family suggested an X-linked type, as her brothers were asymptomatic. At the same time, her only sister had shown hematuria since she was a teenager. Genetic testing was offered to the patient and her offspring but declined as the test was not insured financially.\n\nAfter three successful pregnancies and 3 years from her last delivery, the patient is normotensive, had a normal kidney function test, and was not undergoing any specific treatment. However, recently she had been found to have some auditory changes from tinnitus, mild neurosensory hearing loss, and mild lenticular myopia caused by her anterior lenticonus.\n\nFirst pregnancy (2009)  \nAt the age of 23, the patient came to the antenatal clinics at 7 weeks of gestation, and an early ultrasound examination confirmed a pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and the blood pressure was 90/70 mmHg. Her baseline investigations showed a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dl, 2+ protein from urine analysis, and serum creatinine of 41 \u00b5mol/l (62.0\u2013106.0 \u00b5mol/l). Twenty-four-hour urine collection measured 1.870 g protein. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth assessment, proteinuria, and kidney function testing. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted to the obstetric unit for monitoring because of rising proteinuria of 4.300 g in 24 hours and a borderline amniotic fluid index at 34 weeks. Her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg.\n\nAt 37 weeks of gestation, 24-hour urine collection measured 5.694 g protein, creatinine 49 \u00b5mol/l, total protein 53.4 g/l (60\u201380 g/l), and albumin at 27.8 g/l (35\u201352 g/l). She had a cesarean section at 37 completed weeks for an obstetric reason (breech presentation) and delivered a healthy, 2530 g female newborn baby. Proteinuria dropped down to the early pregnancy levels shortly after delivery. The patient recovered smoothly after surgery and was discharged home with her newborn infant. The patient had a follow-up visit at the nephrology clinic after 2 weeks of her puerperium, which revealed proteinuria of +2 and creatinine of 52 \u00b5mol/l. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the second pregnancy.\n\nSecond pregnancy (2015)  \nAt age 30, the patient came once more to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 13 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, and her blood pressure was 95/60 mmHg. There was a +1 protein in the urine, and the creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetric and nephrology care was arranged with serial growth and fetal well-being assessments, as well as the recording of proteinuria and creatinine levels. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. She was admitted at 30 weeks of gestation so that her borderline amniotic fluid index could be assessed. At 34 weeks of gestation, the patient had an elevated blood pressure of 140/89 mmHg, for which she was again admitted to the hospital for observation. Proteinuria was 3.900 g in a 24-hour collection, serum creatinine was 44 \u00b5mol/l, hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dl, and the platelet count was 222 \u00d7 10^3/mm^3. The total serum protein was 51 g/l, albumin was 27.0 g/l, normal levels of alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase being 8.9 U/l and 15 U/l, respectively. She had a cesarean section due to a suspected dehiscence scar and gave birth to a male newborn infant weighing 2300 g, who was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The mother\u2019s proteinuria and blood pressure dropped shortly after 2 weeks of her delivery. The mother and the newborn infant were discharged home in good health. The patient did not attend the clinics again until the third pregnancy.\n\nThird pregnancy (2017)  \nAt age 32, the patient presented to the antenatal clinics for antenatal care. She was 12 weeks pregnant, confirmed by an early ultrasound examination that revealed a singleton pregnancy consistent with age. The physical examination was unremarkable, with a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. A 24-hour urine collection showed 1.010 g in 2400 ml. The serum creatinine level was 41 \u00b5mol/l. Combined obstetrics and nephrology care was established with serial growth and fetal well-being assessment. At 28 weeks, during a routine antenatal visit, a dipstick for protein showed +3, while the 24-hour urine collection revealed 2.400 g in 1300 ml. Her blood pressure was normal all through her antenatal period. She was under strict observation for symptoms and signs of preeclampsia. At 34 weeks, the protein in the 24-hour urine collection measured 2.900 g in 1200 ml, while serum creatinine was 45 \u00b5mol/l and hemoglobin level 9.1 g/dl. A cesarean section was performed at 37 weeks for obstetric reasons, and a male newborn of 2500 g was delivered and sent to the nursery. After 2 days, the mother and her newborn infant were discharged home. After 4 weeks, the patient was reevaluated once more, and she was doing well, with a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg and a 24-hour urine collection measuring 1.700 g in 2200 ml. There were no auditory or ophthalmological complaints. Late follow-up was lost apart from a few visits documented to the auditory and ophthalmology clinics.",

In addition, there was no specific medication, smoking history, or alcohol consumption. The cause of the accident was a methanol-based paint spill on his clothes that ignited; this incident occurred at a plating factory (Fig. 1: day 1). He was transferred to our hospital for emergency treatment. On arrival, his vital signs included a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 165/102 mmHg, and pulse rate of 90/minute. His body temperature was 37.3 degrees Celsius. His Glasgow Coma Scale score was E4 V5 M6, and there was no motor or sensory paralysis. Physical examination revealed 25% total-body-surface-area flame injuries (7% partial thickness on the trunk and right hand and 18% full thickness on the right arm, both legs, and chest). There were no problems with hand function. On day 2 after admission, the wounds on his two thighs and right arm were debrided, and Integra dermal regeneration templates (Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA) were applied. On day 9 after admission, the wounds on his right lower leg, right arm, and chest were debrided, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. On day 16 after admission, the Integra silicone sheet was removed, and 1:3 meshed 10/1000-inch (0.26 mm) STSGs were applied. Epithelialization had occurred in most parts of the injury; however, the graft failed in the proximal one-third portion of the left thigh, resulting in an ulcer. With topical treatment with a silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing (Aquacel\u00ae Ag BURN: ConvaTec, Princeton, NJ, USA) for 6 days, petroleum gel (PROPETO\u00ae; Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 6 days, a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb, Maruho, Osaka, Japan) for 3 days, and silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh; ALCARE, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 days, the ulcer was covered with healthy granulation tissue (Fig. 1: day 36).

The meshed split-thickness skin graft (STSG) was fixed, and NPWT was applied to both the donor and recipient sites Full size image On day 37 after admission, an operation was performed. The ulcer surface was debrided, and an 11/1000-inch (0.28 mm) skin graft was taken from the ipsilateral thigh and meshed, using a 1:1.5 ratio. A slightly larger skin graft was taken, and the excess skin graft was immediately regrafted to the donor site. The regrafted skin was meshed using a 1:1.5 ratio, the same as the recipient site. NPWT (INFOV.A.C.\u2122 Therapy System, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) was then applied to both the donor and recipient sites with a continuous negative pressure of 125 mmHg. A silicone-faced wound dressing mesh (SI-mesh) was inserted between the skin graft and polyurethane foam dressing (V.A.C. GranuFoam Dressing, KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) to avoid damage to the skin graft (Fig. 1: day 37). On days 37 and 38 after admission, 1 g of cefazolin was administered intravenously every 8 hours as perioperative prophylaxis. On day 43 after admission, the polyurethane foam dressing was removed from both the donor and recipient sites. Although the regrafted skin at the donor site was taken completely, the skin graft was not found at the recipient site, and the entire area was covered with granulation tissue (Fig. 2: day 43, left). No granulation tissue overgrowth was observed at the donor site. The staples that had held the grafts in place were embedded in the granulation tissue and were removed. On the same day, the wound was cleaned under running tap water, and small islands of epithelialization were visible under the granulation tissue. NPWT was ceased, and topical treatment with a hydrocortisone-bacterial culture suspension mixture ointment (Eksalb) was applied (Fig. 2: day 43, right). Rapid epithelialization of the ulcer was observed as the granulation tissue regressed, and epithelialization of both the donor and recipient sites was almost completed on day 48 after admission (5 days after NPWT cessation) (Fig. 2: day 48). No significant change was observed between pre- and postoperative laboratory findings (). In addition, no significant findings were observed in urinalysis on day 17 (), and no further urinalysis was performed during hospitalization because no specific symptoms appeared. The patient was discharged on day 52 after admission and was referred to the local plastic surgery clinic for follow-up, and had recovered uneventfully at 6 months after surgery.

He had a prior episode of suspected convulsion of which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic nodular lesion measuring approximately 60 mm in diameter, located in the left parietal lobe of the cerebrum. The patient was administered medication, and symptoms were subsequently relieved. However, 12 days later, he experienced worsened symptoms and was transferred and admitted to the emergency department of the University of Miyazaki Hospital. MRI showed a mass of 70\u2009\u00d7\u200953\u2009\u00d7\u200957 mm in the left temporoparietal lobe (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). A solid element with slight hypointensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images along the dura mater was noted. Cystic changes were likely associated with the sanguineous fluid. A peritumoral band with hyperintensity on T2-weighted image was observed at the periphery of the lesion, suggesting an extra-axial lesion . A dural tail sign was also noted on the gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image . The lesion appeared to be focally infiltrative to the brain surface, but no apparent connection to the ventricle was observed (Fig. 1 a\u2013c). Preoperative clinical diagnosis included hemangiopericytoma and ependymoma as differential diagnoses. Left parietotemporal craniotomy was performed. The tumor was an extra-axial mass and had partially infiltrated the dura mater and surface of the brain parenchyma in the left temporal lobe. Small pieces of tumor tissue were removed for intraoperative diagnosis. Under an emergency setting, near-total resection was achieved even if the lesion was in the eloquent area. The patient received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (total dose 54 Gy). However, within 1 year postsurgery, the tumor recurred and a second resection surgery was performed. Four years after the first surgery, the tumor metastasized to the spinal cord and the patient eventually died (total postoperative follow-up period was 4 years and 4 months).

Hypotonia and developmental delay of gross motor skills, expressive language, and social skills were the main concerns. At the time of referral, the child could not sit on his own, raise his head, crawl, or speak. However, he could smile. Other disturbing symptoms were frequent vomiting, failure to thrive, recurrent respiratory infections, irritability, and sleep disturbance.\n\nClinical findings\nPhysical examination revealed global neurodevelopmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, severe hypotonia, difficulty in breathing, and a slightly coarse facial appearance with an open mouth and protruding tongue.\n\nTimeline\nAt the age of 9 months, he suffered from hypotonia and delayed development of gross motor skills, expressive language, and social skills. He could not speak, sit, raise his head, or crawl. At the age of 1 year and 10 months, he was diagnosed based on the results of a genetic study. At the age of 2 years, the patient developed recurrent seizures.\n\nDiagnostic assessment\nBased on the initial manifestation, especially the coarse facial features, we initially suspected mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) or mucolipidosis; however, the results of an enzyme assay ruled MPS out.

At the time, positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffuse metastases in the liver, adrenal gland, and bones. Despite high tumor PD-L1 expression, the decision was made to initiate combination chemotherapy plus ICI rather than ICI monotherapy due to the patient\u2019s never-smoking status. The patient received two cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab. He tolerated treatment well, with no high-grade toxicities. However, repeat imaging after two cycles demonstrated concern for disease progression, with enlarging lesions in the lung, liver, adrenal gland, neck, and skull. Although clear growth was observed, it did not meet the threshold for hyperprogression, which is most commonly defined as at least a doubling of tumor growth rate. Given primary disease progression and the high burden of disease, the clinical team planned to change treatment to docetaxel plus ramucirumab. In the weeks following discontinuation of the carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab regimen, the patient reported improved symptoms and energy level, which were attributed to waning of treatment-associated toxicities. On the day prior to the planned initiation of docetaxel plus ramucirumab, repeat imaging was performed to provide a near-term baseline for subsequent efficacy assessment. The chest CT demonstrated improvement compared to the prior CT image. Accordingly, instead of changing the treatment regimen, the clinical team proceeded with two additional cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, following which further response was noted on the chest CT and PET images (Figs. 1, 2). Subsequently, maintenance therapy was initiated with pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab, which was changed to pembrolizumab monotherapy after one cycle due to serum creatinine elevation and fatigue. Since then, the patient has received six cycles of maintenance pembrolizumab, and disease control remains ongoing at 6 months after the initiation of combination chemotherapy plus ICI.

Her vision at presentation was 6/60 (logMAR 1.0) in the right eye and 6/6 (0.0 logMAR) in the left eye. Anterior segment examination revealed pseudophakia in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye. The results of the left eye fundus examination were normal. She had a 10-year history of hypertension that was well-controlled on medication; otherwise, she had no clinically relevant family/social history. Given that the macula was involved, a decision was made to perform pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling and endolaser therapy with or without silicone oil (depending upon the finding of rhegmatogenous breaks, either pre-existing or iatrogenic, during surgery). The surgery was performed using the 23-gauge Constellation Vitrectomy System (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA). This gauge was chosen as there was a lack of stock of 25 G and 27 G sets in India at the time of surgery. Infusion was initiated at 7:00 a.m. through valved micro-cannulae. After anterior, core and peripheral vitrectomy, the epicenter of the fibrous bridge causing foveal split was identified and released using the vitreous cutter . The retina was observed by fall in place following this action. Further procedures could be avoided through proper identification of the epicenter of traction, and the use of intraocular gas/silicone oil was avoided. The eye was left with aqueous tamponade and examined the next day. The optical coherence tomography image showed that the retina had fallen back in place and it continued to re-attach over the following week.

The presence of a history of hypertension suggests the possibility of posterior subcapsular cataract, which is more likely to cause macular involvement than an initial or cortical cataract. The surgery performed, pars plana vitrectomy with membrane peeling and endolaser therapy, is typically used for a tractional detachment. This is a common complication of cataract surgery, where the cataract becomes stuck to the retina after the natural lens is removed.

    "original_case": "A 75-year-old Thai man with a recent history of tuberculosis infection presented with an enlarged tonsil. Following an initial physical examination, the otolaryngologist sent the patient for computed tomography (CT) scan of his neck, which revealed that his tonsil was normal but that there was a mass located incidentally at his cervical spine at the level of C1/C2. There was no history of neck pain, gait abnormalities, or neurological problems. Physical examination revealed only increased tendon reflex of his upper and lower extremities. His neck range of motion was full, and his bowel bladder function was normal. Neither paralysis nor paresthesia was observed. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an extradural enhancing mass at the right C1/C2 level compressing the spinal cord . Despite the subtle clinical neurological deficit, the MRI finding of severe spinal cord compression was concerning, and treatment options were discussed. Due to the high risk of creating instability following resection of the tumor, the treatment chosen was that of additional fusion of the upper cervical spine. Preoperative plain radiographs of the cervical spine and the upper cervical sagittal alignment are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1 T1-weighted, post-contrast injection magnetic resonance imaging images show an enhancing lesion at an extradural location with an intradural extension at the right side of the C1/C2 vertebrae in the coronal (a), sagittal (b), and axial (c) plane. The mass effect caused corresponding spinal cord compression with left posterolateral displacement. No obvious cord signal abnormality was seen. Plain film radiographs of the preoperative cervical spine in the anteroposterior (d) and lateral view (e) also show the measured angle of occiput-C2 (blue), C1\u2013C2 (red), and Takami\u2019s angle (yellow) of \u2212 23\u00b0, \u2212 27\u00b0, and 104\u00b0, respectively.\n\nA standard posterior midline cervical spine approach was carried out. Since preoperative imaging showed that both C2 and C3 pedicles were feasible enough to insert the pedicular screws, we decided to use the technique to achieve maximal strength and stability of the construct system assisted by the CT navigation system. The pedicle screw insertion at the C2 level was uneventful. However, lateral breeching was encountered during the insertion on the right side at the C3 level. Concerned for the risk of bilateral vertebral artery injuries, we switched to the lateral mass screw technique on the other side of C3. Intraoperative neuromonitoring using motor-evoked potentials and somatosensory-evoked potentials were used and remained unchanged from baseline throughout the surgery.\n\nAfter surgery, and while still in the recovery room, the patient complained of discomfort in his throat, accompanied by difficulty swallowing and opening his mouth. Bedside swallowing evaluation revealed some weakness of the neck muscles and desaturation following swallowing of a small amount of water (3 ml). He could not voluntarily cough sharply. The gag reflex was positive on both sides but delayed. Therefore, the rehabilitation physicians suggested keeping him with a nasogastric tube until further evaluation.\n\nPostoperative radiographic examination illustrated that the screw-rod system was intact and that the atlantoaxial alignment was neutral. CT angiography showed no VA injury with good distal flow. MRI of the brain did not demonstrate any evidence of stroke or suspected cause of dysphagia . Using the McGregor line as a reference of the occipital bone, the occiput-C2 and C1\u2013C2 angles were \u2212 1.8\u00b0 and \u2212 25.1\u00b0, respectively (the minus value indicates that the angle is in lordosis). The craniovertebral angle proposed by Takami et al. to evaluate the craniovertebral fixation angle, namely, the angle between the line parallel to the bony palate and the posterior longitudinal line of vertebrae of C2, was 81.1\u00b0. The space between the posterior border of the mandible and the anterior of the cervical spine was narrowed, as was the distance between the screw-rod fixation system and the occiput . Taken together, these findings led us to believe that the cause of the trismus and dysphagia was the position of the screws. Therefore, an operation to adjust the position of the C1 and C2 screws to be relatively more extended position was performed on the eighth day after the first surgery.\n\nFig. 2 Computer tomography reveals the right C3 pedicular screw trajectory, which involves the medial border of the right foramen transversarium and left C3 lateral mass screw (a).

No movement but muscle retraction was observed in the right limb and the Babinski sign is positive. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 17. The patient was a fruit seller without previous chronic diseases, and denied smoking and drinking history, toxic and drug exposure, and family history. Noncontrast brain computed tomography (CT) and CT venography scan in another hospital showed CVST in straight sinus and sagittal sinus .

Unfortunately, the patient\u2019s symptoms did not improve significantly. We performed a second cerebral angiography and found nonvisualization of the straight sinus and the right transverse, while the large thrombus almost disappeared. Using balloon dilation and thrombus aspiration, we found that the visualization of right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus was improved, while that of the straight sinus was not (Fig. 1 c, d). After intervention, full-dose anticoagulation therapy was administrated, despite large bruises on both upper limbs and slight hemorrhage in the thalamus. The patient\u2019s consciousness state was gradually improved within 2 days. Her later laboratory examination showed that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was low with high free triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (T4), and antibodies, but she was never diagnosed or treated. The department of endocrinology was consulted, she was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, and corresponding drug treatment was carried out. She was discharged with her NIHSS score decreased to 2.

He was the first child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents with no family history of hematological or congenital disorders. During the first month of his life, he gained weight exclusively from breastfeeding; however, he gradually started vomiting and having diarrhea. Laboratory examinations revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin, 52 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 37\u2009\u00d7\u200910^9/L) with the presence of schistocytes (8% of red blood cells). Mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were 84.4 fL, 30 pg, and 360 g/L, respectively. Reticulocyte elevation was inadequate (28\u2030 of red blood cells). Although lactate dehydrogenase was elevated to 1728 U/L, and total bilirubin and potassium were also elevated, direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative ().\n\n Results of laboratory examination at diagnosis Full size table Bone marrow aspiration showed hyperplasia and megaloblastic change of erythroblasts, both of which are indicative of megaloblastic anemia. Dysplasia of granulocytes was also confirmed, and the percentage of megakaryocytes was decreased . While further examinations were being performed, the patient suddenly developed pulmonary hemorrhage, resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest. Although the patient responded to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he developed severe hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Subsequently, he was started on intensive care including hemodialysis, plasma exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and frequent blood transfusions. On the fifth day of hospitalization, serum folate level was found to be undetectable (normal, 11\u201334 nmol/L). This led us to confirm that folate deficiency was the cause of the megaloblastic anemia. Although intravenous folate supplementation (folinic acid, 6 mg/day) was initiated, the patient died of circulatory failure 19 days after hospitalization . Examination of autopsy samples revealed that the megaloblastic change in his bone marrow had disappeared; however, the cause of pulmonary hemorrhage could not be confirmed. An amino acid analysis conducted before intravenous folate replenishment indicated high levels of serum homocysteine, serum cysteine, and urine cysteine, and a low level of serum methionine, which normalized after the administration of medication (). In Japan, all newborns are screened for metabolic disorders. On reanalysis of his neonatal blood sample, methionine, homocysteine, and cysteine levels were found to be normal (). Thus, the abnormal pattern of amino acids was consistent with HFM.\n\nFig. 1 Bone marrow smear examination at diagnosis.

The patient also reported a recent loss of weight: around 3 kg down from 97 kg within the last month. A medical interview revealed occupational exposure to asbestos since the patient had been working in a factory producing asbestos seals for several years. His body mass index was 37.8 kg/m\u00b2, and body surface area was 2.09 m\u00b2. Physical examination revealed lower limb edema as well as painful and enlarged left testis of regular shape and firm consistency, without any palpable focal lesion. Owing to enlarged testis, ultrasonography imaging (USG) and blood tests were performed. USG revealed diffuse testis enlargement but did not reveal any focal malignancies originating from the testis. Results of the blood test showed an increased level of \u03b2-hCG (644.4 lU/l). The other tumor markers, that is, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remained within the normal range (230 U/ml, 1.58 U/ml, and 0.874 ng/ml, respectively). Surprisingly, the following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass up to 62 mm in the posterior part of the prostatic gland, infiltrating seminal vesicles and anterior rectum wall together with bilaterally enlarged iliac lymph nodes. Additionally, computed tomography (CT) confirmed metastasis in pelvic lymph nodes. Cystoscopy was performed, and a biopsy specimen from tumor mass from prostate and bladder was taken. Histopathological examination of the specimens obtained in the cystoscopy revealed prostate and muscle of the bladder infiltration consisting of high-grade invasive carcinoma and the presence of large syncytiotrophoblastic cells. Carcinoma cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), GATA3, p63, and CKHMW but negative for PSA. Some of these large syncytiotrophoblastic cells inside the tumor showed positivity for \u03b2-hCG .

However, reassessment of the radiographic imaging led to the conclusion that the tumor was predominantly located in the prostate, which suggested the prostate as the primary origin and established the diagnosis of prostate cancer with secondary bladder involvement. However, the treatment of cancer remains the same regardless of primary origin. As subsequent radiography imaging of the chest did not reveal any focal changes, the presence of metastasis in the chest was excluded. In March 2020, the patient started neoadjuvant chemotherapy with intravenous cisplatin 75 mg/m\u00b2 on the first day and intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m\u00b2 on the 1st, 8th, and 15th repeating cycle every 4 weeks (cisplatin\u2013gemcitabine protocol, PG). His symptoms improved significantly, and the \u03b2-hCG concentration decreased (205.2 mIU/ml) within the first 2 months of therapy. However, after two cycles, \u03b2-hCG level slightly increased (504.8 mIU/ml) and hyperhidrosis recurred. After four cycles, computed tomography (CT) revealed that local treatment could not be implemented owing to rectum infiltration. PG chemotherapy was continued up to six cycles. Four months later, after completion of PG chemotherapy, MRI showed disease progression. Pelvic tumor enlarged to 90 mm in diameter, and pelvic lymph nodes enlarged to maximum 21 mm in short-axis diameter . Simultaneously, \u03b2-hCG concentration increased to 9446 mIU/ml. In October 2020, palliative chemotherapy was implemented (paclitaxel 80 mg/m\u00b2 once a week). After the fifth cycle of paclitaxel, the patient presented with polyneuropathy, so gabapentin was administered but withdrawn because of dizziness. However, the dizziness aggravated, so a CT scan of the brain was performed. It revealed small, diffuse metastases up to 8 mm in the pons. At that time, the \u03b2-hCG concentration reached the highest value of 31,163 mIU/ml. Palliative radiotherapy was planned, but owing to rapid deterioration of general condition (PS \u00be), the patient did not manage to start the treatment. Eventually, the patient died in November 2020, 2 weeks after diagnosis of brain metastasis, because of disease progression.",

There were features consistent with colorectal cancer on flexible sigmoidoscopy. There were no metastases seen on a staging CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis. No positron emission tomography-CT was undertaken. He had radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer 10 years earlier, with a recent biochemical relapse that was being managed with hormonal therapy. His latest prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 1.8 ng/ml. After fully discussing all options for management of his sigmoid tumor, the patient opted for management with a colonic stent. However, this did not relieve his symptoms and the stent became occluded. He therefore underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy. The inferior mesenteric artery was ligated, and a colonic specimen from descending colon to the upper rectum was resected along with the corresponding mesocolon. There were no peritoneal deposits, and no evidence of metastatic disease intraoperatively. He was discharged on the fourth postoperative day without complications. The specimen was sent for histological examination. When the specimen was examined, there was mucinous colonic adenocarcinoma in the mesenteric fat  with some further nodal metastases of the same in 1 out of 27 sampled lymph nodes . There were also separate, well-defined metastatic tumor deposits comprising smaller, cuboidal cells embedded within the pericolic fat of the mesocolon that differed from the tall columnar cells seen in colorectal cancer (Fig. 1 c, d). Due to the patient\u2019s previous history of prostate cancer, immunohistochemical staining for PSA and prostate-specific acid phosphatase (PSAP) was undertaken and was positive (Fig. 1 e and f respectively).

The patient was well oriented (GSC 15) with vital signs of blood pressure 100/70, respiratory rate 20, temperature 36.7 \u00b0C, and O2 saturation of 96%. On examination, the distal pulse of his left limb could not be detected and was cold, with a hematoma at the injury site. Color Doppler sonography of lower limbs demonstrated weak arterial flow in distal arteries. Abdominal fast sonography was unremarkable.

Physical examination revealed a 20-mm movable hard mass within the inferolateral quadrant of the right breast with no findings on the overlying skin. Mammography revealed a spiculated mass with segmental and linear calcifications in the mediolateral portion of the right breast (Fig. 1 a, b). Ultrasonography revealed a rough-bordered mass showing internal hypoechogenicity and measuring 16 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 mm\u00b3 in size, in the inferolateral quadrant of the right breast . Magnetic resonance imaging showed a round mass, measuring 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 11 mm\u00b3 in size with rim enhancement . Fine needle aspiration cytology of an axillary lymph node measuring 12 mm in diameter revealed the presence of malignant cells . PET/CT also showed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in the right breast primary [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 11.5] and right axillary lymph node (SUVmax 2.1). Multiple lymph nodes in the right supraclavicular fossa, mediastinum, and around the bilateral hilar, dorsal pancreatic head, abdominal aorta, right common iliac region, and bilateral external iliac region appeared swollen and positive for FDG accumulation (SUVmax 17.0), suggesting distant lymph node metastases (Fig. 1 e, f). Differential diagnoses for multiple lymphadenopathy were required because of the large dissociation between the primary breast cancer and locoregional and distant metastases. Lymph node involvement by malignant tumor, especially malignant lymphoma, and granulomatous disease could be enumerated as differential diagnoses. Suitable lymph nodes that appeared swollen and positive for FDG accumulation near the body surface could not be found for biopsy. For histological diagnosis of multiple lymphadenopathy, EBUS-TBNA of mediastinal lymph nodes was performed (Fig. 3 a, b). Histological findings revealed noncaseous epithelioid granulomas and multinucleated giant cells in mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 3 c, d). Tuberculosis had not been suspected strongly because CT scan did not reveal any exudative lesion in the lung field. Caseous granulomas were not found in all areas on the biopsy sample; therefore, acid-fast bacillus staining was omitted. This patient had been diagnosed with uveitis of unknown cause 5 years before. Systemic disease had been suspected, and necessary screening examining unknown details had been performed.

Based on a history of uveitis, the elevated concentration of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and the histological findings, we reached a diagnosis.

After discussing with the patient and her family, 3 days after the patient\u2019s admission, the medical team decided to perform bronchoscopic examination and tracheobronchial mass removal through rigid bronchoscopy. Lobulated masses obstructing almost the entire distal tracheal lumen up to the carina and the entire left main bronchus lumen were found on bronchoscopy . A neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser was used first to facilitate mass shrinkage. After the laser treatment, mechanical debulking using a rigid scope was performed. Intraprocedure bleeding was managed with argon plasma coagulation (APC) through posttherapeutic bronchoscopy.

The clinical target volume (CTV) was GTV + 1 cm, and the planning target volume was CTV + 0.5 cm. The total dose plan amounted to 60\u2009Gy, but the radiation dose could be delivered at 40 Gy and administered in 20 fractions of 2\u2009Gy. After 20 fractions of radiation over 4 weeks, the patient developed esophagitis and dysphagia. Positioning the patient with thermoplastic masks was difficult because of mucous hypersecretion and persistent coughing. Two weeks after the radiotherapy series, the patient received a chemotherapy regimen consisting of carboplatin with an area under the curve of 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, given three times weekly for a total of six cycles. The patient tolerated the treatment well and did not experience any toxicities. Two months after completion of the treatment, the patient had no dyspnea. In reevaluation by chest CT scan, no mass in either lung or the mediastinum and no lymph node enlargement were visible . The trachea and main bronchi were normal (Fig. 1 B, F). Bronchoscopy also revealed no mass and only slight malacia . Finally, the patient was planned to undergo routine evaluation by thoracic CT scan every 3\u20136 months.

On admission, workup was notable for hemoglobin of 5.7 g/dL, prothrombin time (PT) 28.1 seconds (s), INR 2.7, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) > 180 seconds, D-dimer of 1.02 \u03bcg/mL (normal < 0.5 \u03bcg/mL), and normal fibrinogen. Anticoagulation was held, but she continued to develop bruises daily with persistently elevated PTT > 180 seconds that failed to correct with mixing studies, raising concern for a factor deficiency. Further workup revealed factor VIII activity < 1% (normal 75\u2013220%). Given her prolonged PTT, LA testing was performed and found to be positive. Initial testing for a factor VIII inhibitor using the standard Bethesda assay was confounded by the presence of LA, requiring a specialized chromogenic Bethesda assay, which confirmed the presence of the inhibitor at 61 Bethesda units (normal \u2264 0.5 units). She did not meet diagnostic criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) despite testing positive for LA; additional testing was negative for anticardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein antibodies. Given the association between acquired factor VIII inhibitors and malignancy, additional screening for concomitant malignancy was performed. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was unremarkable. Serum protein electrophoresis suggested an inflammatory picture but was otherwise unremarkable.

The presence of an inhibitor is also not consistent with that diagnosis, as inhibitors are typically IgG antibodies that are difficult to form without a genetic basis. The presence of an LA makes it challenging to identify factor VIII levels, leading to the delay in diagnosis.

    "original_case": "A 59-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to the emergency department with a rapidly expanding mass in the thoracic wall in relation to the inferior part of the left shoulder blade. His medical history included mild renal insufficiency and epilepsy. He did not take any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication. Six weeks earlier he fell 4 m from a ladder, resulting in multiple rib fractures and a left-sided pneumothorax diagnosed on chest radiography. The pneumothorax was treated with a chest drain placed in the left anterior axillary line at the level of the papilla. Pain-relieving medication included paracetamol, ibuprofen, and oxycodone, and the patient was released from the hospital after 5 days of treatment. The mass in the thoracic wall had appeared the previous evening about 8 hours before the patient came to the hospital and kept expanding slowly during his stay in the emergency department. He had pain in his left shoulder, and his left-hand fingers felt cold and tingling with no further neurological symptoms. A clinical examination revealed a skin-colored, sore swelling approximately 10 cm in diameter in relation to the inferior angle of his left shoulder blade. Vital parameters were normal. Blood results showed hemoglobin levels of 9.18 g/dL compared with 11.92 g/dL 6 weeks earlier. Thoracic computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a large mass in relation to the left scapula located between the costae/intercostal muscles and the serratus anterior muscle. The mass measured 7 cm \u00d7 14 cm \u00d7 18 cm (anteroposteriorly \u00d7 right\u2013left \u00d7 craniocaudally) equaling a volume of approximately 930 mL (Eq. 1). Two sites of active bleeding were identified on the left dorsal scapular artery located between the medial border of the scapula and numerous rib fractures. The CTA showed rib fractures from the 3rd to the 12th left rib, including double rib fractures of the 4th to 7th rib, corresponding to the shape of the scapula (Paraclinical photos). The patient remained stable and was transferred to the department of cardiothoracic surgery. Open exploration was chosen because of compression symptoms. At primary surgery, the mass was evacuated beneath the left latissimus dorsi. The bleeding source was not found, and the resulting cavity was packed with gauze binding. At second look the following day, the scapula was lifted, coagulated blood was removed, and the bleeding sources on the left dorsal scapular artery were identified and ligated. The patient was discharged from the hospital after a total of 3 days. Six months later, the patient was well with no sequelae. Aims of the systematic literature review We conducted a review of the literature to identify how previous cases of chest wall masses exterior to the endothoracic fascia following blunt trauma have been diagnosed and managed. We hypothesized that most cases were diagnosed by CTA of the chest and managed by surgical drainage similarly to our case.",

    "original_case": "A 24-year-old Nepalese primigravida with no remarkable personal or family medical history was admitted to our hospital with a platelet count of 97,000/\u00b5L at 12 weeks of gestation. Blood biochemistry analysis revealed elevated levels of platelet associated (PA) immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 214 ng/10^7 cells, while Helicobacter pylori IgG, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, and hepatitis B surface antigen were all negative. There were no findings suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, viral infection, or liver dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with a condition, and her platelet levels were monitored periodically until the end of the second trimester to assess if the platelet count will fall below 30,000/\u00b5L. At 21 weeks of gestation, her platelet count decreased to 30,000/\u00b5L. Additionally, her hemoglobin levels reduced from 12.2 g/dL at 12 weeks to 8.1 g/dL at 23 weeks and eventually to 7.6 g/dL at 27 weeks gestation. Such a decline in hemoglobin was concluded as macrocytic anemia due to a decrease in her vitamin B12 levels; however, oral administration of ferrous citrate and vitamin supplementation were ineffective. No significant abnormalities in the bone marrow were detected through bone marrow puncture. Oral administration of vitamins for anemia was stopped at 31 weeks of gestation. We started administering prednisolone, oral corticosteroid, for thrombocytopenia at 33 weeks of gestation; however, no significant change in platelet count was observed. Therefore, we started blood transfusion therapy, while continuing with 10 mg prednisolone. At the beginning of the 36th and 37th week of pregnancy, 10 units of platelets were transfused each time, which led to an increase in the platelet count from 18,000 to 40,000 and 12,000 to 27,000/\u00b5L, respectively. From the beginning of the 38th week of pregnancy, we administered high-dose immunoglobulin therapy for 5 days; however, the platelet count did not increase enough to support childbirth. Next, we administered romiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, which had no effect on the platelet count. At a platelet count of 9000/\u00b5L, a third round of 10 units of platelet transfusion was performed, but it was ineffective in increasing the platelet count. At this stage, the anti-human leukocyte antigen (anti-HLA) antibody test was positive. To treat the anemia, 2 units of red blood cell fluids were administered, which increased the hemoglobin levels from 6.9 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL. Labor was induced in the patient on the first day of the 39th week of pregnancy. As the platelet count was only 41,000/\u00b5L, before complete dilation of the uterine ostium, 10 units of HLA-matched platelets and 20 units of concentrated platelets were transfused. A female infant weighing 2677 g was delivered vaginally. During the episiotomy suture, another 10 units of platelets were transfused. No hematoma was observed in the birth canal; however, the patient lost almost a liter of blood due to uterine atony. After delivery, the patient\u2019s hemoglobin level was 6.5 g/dL; hence, 4 units of red blood cell fluids were transfused, and dry iron sulfate was administered orally. On the fifth day of puerperium, 15 units of HLA-matched platelets were transfused, as the platelet count was only 26,000/\u00b5L. On the sixth day of puerperium, no significant changes were observed through bone marrow puncture and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the seventh day of puerperium, the platelet count and hemoglobin level recovered to 63,000/\u00b5L and 8.3 g/dL respectively, and the patient was discharged . All oral medications were discontinued on the 29th day of puerperium, when the platelet count was 44,000/\u00b5L and the hemoglobin level reached 10.2 g/dL. The patient was diagnosed with a condition on the 78th day of puerperium, since the platelet count spontaneously recovered to 101,000/\u00b5L. Additionally, mild splenomegaly was observed during the puerperium through transabdominal ultrasonography. Fig. 1 Progress of platelet count and hemoglobin content under treatment details. She developed severe thrombocytopenia and anemia during pregnancy. All medications were ineffective, and she required blood transfusion therapy Full size image The infant's Apgar score was 5 points after 1 min and 7 points after 5 minutes. She had weak breathing and started convulsions 3 minutes after birth. Some other symptoms in the infant included attenuated light reflex, midline fixation of the eyeballs, respiratory depression, and wheezing. Hypertonia and purpura were observed throughout the body, and the epidermal detachment of the face and limbs was remarkable . Additionally, her platelet count was 17,000/\u00b5L, and acute subdural hematoma and hepatosplenomegaly were observed. These symptoms were refractory to therapeutic interventions such as concentrated platelets and immunoglobulins. The infant was diagnosed with a condition at 37 days of age by mass screening, and a homozygous mutation (p.L483R) was found in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. After receiving enzyme replacement therapy at 64 and 78 days of age, she died of suffocation at 82 days of age. The \u03b2-glucosidase activity of the patient and her husband was normal, and a heterozygous mutation in the GBA gene was found in both. Therefore, we diagnosed them as carriers of a condition and provided genetic counseling for future pregnancies including prenatal diagnosis such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling.
